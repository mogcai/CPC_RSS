The storm forced to move more than 350,000 people in the archipelago, days after the passage of the Ragasa superrtup.
A spokesman for the Civil Defense Office, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro, indicated in a video statement to know ten deaths, three recorded in the Eastern Province of Master, due to the collapse of trees and houses, and the rest in the center of the Philippines.
Fourteen people are still missing in the center of the Philippines, the authorities reported without further details. More than 200,000 people from locations in the storm's trajectory were welcomed in centers for this purpose. Known in the archipelago as Opong, the typhoon also forced evacuating 351,840 people, according to data from the Catastrophs Management Council (NDRRMC), and to decree the closure of government offices and schools.
The typhoon hit the province of Eastern Samar on Thursday night, accompanied by winds of up to 165 kilometers per hour, according to the Filipine Meteorological Agency (Pagasa), before crossing the Bicol region and the Western Island of Mindoro, losing strength as he advanced.
Bualoi has gaining strength again after entering the sea of ​​southern China, said Pagasa. The typhoon went to Vietname, where, according to the meteorological agency, could reach land between Sunday night and today

The typhoon hit the archipelago after Super Typhoon Ragasa hit the north of the country last Monday, causing at least a dozen dead and 17 injured among thousands of displaced people.
Tuphins are recurring phenomena in Southeast Asia, when the hot waters of the Pacific Ocean favor the formation of cyclones, and countries like Philippines are reached every year by about twenty of these tropical storms, especially at the rainy season, which usually begins in June and ends in November or December.
According to scientists, climate change is causing more frequent and intense extreme weather phenomena around the world. The archipelago is going through a moment of popular indignation for corruption in flood control millionaire projects, designed to protect citizens from the effects of tuffles and floods and allegedly completed, but in reality nonexistent or of poor quality.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 04:47:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Cotai | Recovered land occupied illegally</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/cotai-recuperado-terreno-ocupado-ilegalmente/</link><description>The government recovered land next to the Macao East Asia Sports Ship that had been illegally occupied.

A woman and five-year-old son remain in the intensive care of a Hong Kong hospital after Tuesday were taken by waves in Chai Wan, a riverside area in the city.
"When a disaster happens, such as tuffons or tsunamis, if people are alerted, the hypothesis of injuries is very reduced or minimal," said Faith Chan Ka Shun. "Unless we are talking about crazy people, who will still surf or for the beach to take a look, there are a risk," added the professor at the University of Nottingham Ningbo.
Yau Yung, a professor at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, argued that it is necessary to "educate people to really be aware and deal with these extreme climate."
"I would say that, at the current moment, the formation of the population is not enough, in Hong Kong and also in Macao," lamented the urban planning expert, who pointed to Japan as a good reference.
Japan is located in the fire ring, one of the world's most active seismic zones, and suffers frequency tremors, so infrastructure in the country have been specially designed to resist on these occasions.
In addition, it stressed Yau, public schools in Japan include, since primary education, education on "importance and how they should respond to this type of emergency situations."
Start at school
In addition, defended the sustainability expert, betting on children's education can generate "a kind of virtuous cycle," because they "can actually teach adults." In Macao, videos of people were shared on social networks on flooded streets, fish that had escaped nurseries and aquariums in stores and restaurants, at a time when the maximum warning of typhoon was still in force.
"Of course it is possible to laugh at the situation and say that it really depends on people, if they want to die to be able to see the waves climbing," admitted Faith Chan, an academic born in Hong Kong. But the Professor of Environmental Sciences recalled that dangerous behaviors during the passage of typhoons may also lead to the death of firefighters or police officers, if a rescue operation is required.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 03:58:16</pubDate></item><item><title>China Cultural Week | Crafts at the fishermen's dock</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/semana-cultural-da-china-artesanato-na-doca-dos-pescadores/</link><description>Doca dos Fishermen receives, until November, the Craft Fair integrated in the 17th Cultural Week of China and Portuguese -speaking countries, which opened doors this Saturday.

Leaded Executive Sam Hou Fai states that the document "contains comments not supported by facts about Macao's economic and political development", "including unfounded allegations on the improvements introduced by MSAR in its electoral regime and the law on the defense of state security."
The Trump Administration Department led by Marco Rubio begins by indicating that, as regards the investment environment, the “Macao Government maintains a transparent, non -discriminatory and free market economy”, and that the local executive “is committed to maintaining a favorable environment for investors”.
However, it adds that "foreign companies cite the constant shortages of qualified workers, the result of the dependence of the tourism city and gambling, as one of the main restrictions on its operations and future expansion." In this chapter, the State Department highlights the priority given to local workers, but criticizes some basic policies of MSAR.
In the document it is also highlighted that "the legal system of Macao is based on the rule of law and the independence of the judicial power" and that "foreign and national companies are registered under the same rules and are subject to the same set of commercial laws and bankruptcy."
However, the State Department states that the government's effort to achieve the aim of diversifying the game, dependent on the game, obtained minimal results. Also the bet on the role of Macao as a trade and services platform between China and Portuguese -speaking countries is referred to.
"China also advised Macao to become a 'commercial and business cooperation services platform' between mainland China and the Portuguese-speaking countries (PLP). Direct trade between Macau and the PLP is still marginal, representing only 0.9 percent of the total dollar $ 17.6 billion in 2024," was mentioned.
The executive led by Sam Hoi Fai responded by stating that the role of Macao "as a service platform for commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries is increasingly recognized everywhere."
The jewelry of the crown
Despite the US body's recognition of economic development, business environment, tax regime and investment incentive measures, the government considers that "achievements and progress" achieved by the MSAR "cannot be erased by such a report from the United States."
In the analysis of the State Department, criticism of the laws that regulate the elections of the head of the Executive and the deputies of the Legislative Assembly, as well as the legislation of safeguarding the state defense of the state.
In the first set of laws, the Government of the MSAR responded by alluding to the elections of September 14. The electorate fully exercised his democratic rights and enthusiastically participated in the vote. "The influx to the polls has reached a record with more than 175,000 voters, which represents a participation rate of 53.35 percent. This fully demonstrates that the electoral regime of the Revised Legislative Assembly gained the support and recognition of residents in general", was indicated in relation to the legal reform that established the recent principle "Macau ruled by patriots".
Regarding legislation to safeguard state security, the executive of Sam Hou Fai counter-attaca and states that "in fact," the United States has long promulgated a series of strict national security laws and often abuse their extraterritorial jurisdiction. "
"Instead of self-reflection, the US unilaterally criticizes others, demonstrating a double standard classic and hypocrisy. The United States are an important economic partner of MSAR. We hope that the American part will abstain from politicizing economic issues, cease political maneuvers and focus on actions that lead to the stable development of economic relations and bilateral commercial relations," said the executive of the executive of the executive, "said the executive Mand.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 04:55:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Tuffons | Experts warn you to reinforce preparation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/tufoes-especialistas-avisam-para-necessidade-de-reforcar-preparacao/</link><description>Several academics point out that the fact that there was no dead during the passage of the Ragasa Super Typhoon was due to civil protection mechanisms, implemented after the great typhoons of 2017 and 2018
 
After Super Typhoon Ragasa, the most powerful storm registered on the planet in 2025, experts told Lusa that Macau and Hong Kong have to learn to live in a world of constant flooding and extreme climate. Ragasa forced the two Chinese Special Administrative Regions to maintain the maximum tuft alert - Level 10 - for more than ten hours, a new historical record.
Authorities had warned that this super typhoon could bring comparable conditions to Mangkhut, which in September 2018 caused estimated damage to Hong's $ 4.6 billion in the former British colony, and to the hat, considered the worst typhoon in over 50 years to reach Macau, which in 2017 caused ten dead and 240 injured in the territory.
The impact of Ragasa was much lower. In Hong Kong, there were about 100 people injured, 1,220 fallen trees and more than a thousand canceled flights. In Macao, the floods reached 1.51 meters, but only seven injured were recorded. Yau Yung, professor at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, argues that it was not luck, but “structural adaptation”. Faith Chan Ka Shun, a professor at the University of Nottingham Ningbo, says the absence of deaths was “a victory”, which is due to improvements in the alert system and the preparation of civil protection.
"This time they prepared very early, more than 12 hours [before Ragasa's passage]. People could decide to lose money because they stopped work, schools and everything else," said the Hong Kong-born academic.
Casinos Losses
In Macau the authorities ended the casinos for 33 hours. Operators will have lost 880 million patacas in revenues, almost 5 percent from September, estimated Jeffrey Kiang, analyst at CLSA consultant, quoted by the Ggraia news portal.
Even before Ragasa's passage, Macao's government leader already showed optimism, pointing to the implementation of evacuation plans for the low areas and the annual exercise of exercise.
Sam Hou Fai also underlined the entry into operation of rainwater lifting stations and sewage projects, which “significantly improved” the ability to drain and flood prevention. Yau Yung admitted that it would be possible to "really project a city to make it the flood test," building "large-scale infrastructures," like the rails that protect the Italian city of Venice.
But with much of Macau practically at sea level, a large -scale system “may not be effective or economically viable,” warned the urban planning expert.
Enjoy the sea
On the other hand, it stressed Faith Chan, would make it harder for the population to enjoy the sea, part of the history and culture of both cities.
The Professor of Environmental Sciences recalled that there are areas of Macau and Hong Kong where floods are chronic during the rainy season between May and September, even without typhoons.
Therefore, Chan argued that it makes more sense to build infrastructures to mitigate the impact of floods, namely underground tanks to store rainwater. The sustainable flood management expert has given the example of the Netherlands, where parking parks are designed with space to divert rainwater.
Yau Yung argued that including rainwater tanks should be “a mandatory requirement” for any building to be built in Macau and Hong Kong. "Of course it would cost some money, but in fact, the benefits can compensate for the investment in the medium term. I would say it's a good deal," added the expert in inclusive cities.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 03:54:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Traffic | Accident causes six injuries on the Friendship Bridge</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/transito-acidente-provoca-seis-feridos-na-ponte-da-amizade/</link><description>An accident on Saturday involving four vehicles on the Friendship Bridge, which circulated towards Taipa-Macau, resulted in six minor injuries.
According to the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP), quoted by the TDM radio channel in Chinese language, preliminary investigations indicate that the 21 -year -old driver of the last car has not controlled the speed and clashed in the front car, causing a chain collision.
The resident of Macao was the subject of a judicial action. The CPSP, which registered the accident around 7:30 pm on Saturday, confirmed that the six injured, drivers and passengers from other vehicles, suffered minor injuries. The help services confirmed that the victims, all residents of Macao, had abrasions, bruises and lacerations. Were transported to the hospital conscious and in a stable state. The drivers involved performed the alcohol test, with negative result.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 03:52:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Inflation reaches higher value since January</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/economia-inflacao-atinge-valor-mais-elevado-desde-janeiro/</link><description>In August, the prices of non -alcoholic food and drinks were mainly responsible for inflation. However, the price of incomes and mortgages are also rising
 
Inflation accelerated in August to the highest level since January, it was announced Friday, in a month when the consumer price rate fell in the interior of China.
The index rose 0.27 percent in August, in homologous terms, more than double the amount recorded in July (0.11 percent), and the highest value since January (0.57 percent), according to official data. According to the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC), the acceleration of inflation was mainly due to food products and non-alcoholic beverages (plus 0.44 percent). The cost of meals acquired outside the home rose 1.54 percent.
Expenditure on lace or apartment mortgages rose 0.84 percent and 0.56 percent, respectively, even before the Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM) approved, on 18 September, the first decrease in the interest rate since the end of 2024. The Legislative Assembly of the Territory approved, in April 2024, the end of several taxes on the acquisition of housing, to “increase liquidity” Real estate market, at the time defended the Secretary for Economics and Finance, Law Wai Nong.
Recovering
With the recovery of the number of visitors, the region registered a 19.1 percent increase in the price of jewelery, goldsmiths and watches, popular products among tourists in the interior of China. In the opposite direction, the cost of excursions and hotels for travels abroad of Macao residents increased by 8.29 percent, while spending on education and insurance rose 1.27 percent and 1.34 percent, respectively.
In the interior of China, by far the largest commercial partner in Macau, the IPC returned to fall 0.4 percent in August, in homologous terms, the fifth month of deflation in the last half year. Deflation reflects weakness in domestic consumption and investment and is particularly severe, as a drop in the price of assets, as a rule contracted with credit, generates an imbalance between the value of loans and bank guarantees.
The data surprised the analysts, who provided for a 0.2 percent price contraction, after the rate was unchanged in July, ending four consecutive months of falling. The price index in the producer, which measures the prices to exit the factory, fell 2.9 percent in August, noting the 35th consecutive month of contraction, despite representing an improvement against the decrease of 3.6 percent recorded in July. In the neighboring Hong Kong region, inflation rose slightly from 1 percent in July to 1.1 percent in August.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 03:49:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Television | Documentaries on Thought XI shown in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/televisao-documentarios-sobre-pensamento-de-xi-exibidos-em-macau/</link><description>From October 13 will be broadcast the documentary series “Passion of Xi Jinping for Culture” on TDM and TV Cabo Macau, as well as on the digital platforms of various Chinese newspapers.

The tremor was recorded at 05:49, local time (4:49 am in Macao), with epicenter ten kilometers deep, and was felt hard in several counties from the cities of Dinxi and Tianshui, according to the official Xinhua agency. In Longxi Rural County, damage was recorded at various dwellings, according to residents' testimonies, although authorities are still collecting information to evaluate the damage.
Local teams and rescue vehicles have been sent to the earthquake zone, to which the Emergency Ministry of Emergency Management will be joined. West China (where the autonomous regions of Tibet and Xinjiang and provinces such as Gansu or Qinghai) often suffer from earthquakes, due to proximity to the place where the tectonic plates of Asia and India meet in Himalayas.

In the verses dezanove and twenty wrote:
We were the unique fish,
How would we escape death?
We can only be like the mandarin ducks,
No desires of immortality?
The Mandarin Patos (Aix Galericulata) whose designation Yuanyang reveals the union of two different, from the male and the Fémean, were pecebble as beings that showed the affection and marital fidelity, mating for a lifetime and as such copies for the stability of the social fabric. And as models can be seen in so many decorative objects for the home and, as can be read in the proverb, Chengyu, his conduct, a life goal: "Be like two mandarin ducks playing in water" (yuanyang xishui).
In the art of painting its richly colorful appearance would be reproduced in detail in the genus Niaohua, of "birds and flowers". But this was not the aquatic bird chosen in a horizontal roll made by Zhao Ji (1082-1135), the Emperor of the Song Huizong, who preferred the least exuberant, more vulgar brave duck (Anas Playrhynhos) Yeya, to appear in the admirable corners in the willow and brave ducks in the herbs (paint and color on paper, 223.2 x 34 cm, in the museum Shanghai).
From this duck the poets almost always underline their gregarious conduct, as in the poem of Du Fu (712-770) the lonely wild swan where, identifying with the swan, expresses a complaint because he feels neglected, and that ends with the verses: "Indifferent, the brave ducks challenged in clamor, confusing the shouts of the other birds everywhere." But it was not in a group but alone in his carefree existence, who was figured by a painter of the Yuan dynasty.
Chen Lin (c.1260-1368) made in a small horizontal roll (35.7 x 47.5 cm, ink and color on paper, at the National Palace Museum in Taipei) the figure of a duck isolated on the margin, near the river under hibiscus leaves, furong (Hibiscus mutabilis) whose flower, one of which is changed to the floor, is changing color, white to red.
The detail as the duck's feathers are figurative, in contrast to the rustic form of waves and leaves reveals a mutation in acting. And because of the ducks it is said that they are the first to detect the arrival of spring when experimenting with the water temperature, the impression of the passage of time is emphasized.
In an inscription on the painting, the poet and calcipr Qiu Yuan (1247-1326) says that it was made during a visit by the author to the studio of the famous painter Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) in the fall.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves - Coordinator of the CCCM Educational Service
In their philosophies about death, Portuguese and Chinese differ in the fundamentals, especially when the Taoist cultural matrix comes into play, but they agree in some aspects, when the Confucian Philosophy dominates. For the latter, as well as for the Portuguese, death causes mourning, sadness, suffering and pain. Confucius in the Analects advised a three -year mourning to all those to whom the parents died and death was a subject of extreme consequences and severity, while for the so -called passing was and is no more than a natural transformation, in a process in which life and death complement each other and interpenetrate in such a way that one cannot be perspective without the other, so funerals should not be space of pain and pain, no way not to interfere with the process of transmuting the being in question.
The Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi (莊子, 369-286) reports in the third of the seven inner chapters of the homonymous work, one of the various episodes of death, relative to the school's patriarch funeral, Lazi (老子), where the way the disciples are lived to the disciples to sentimental manifestations:
They violated the nature of things as they abandoned themselves to sentimentality, in ancient times it was considered 'a crime of violation of nature'. The return of your master to the earth is timely and his natural departure. A timely return and a natural match has nothing to do with joy or sadness. This was considered emancipation of division by the ancients.
Resins and wood can be consumed, but fire will continue. No one knows when the fire ends.
(是遁天倍情 ， 忘其所受 ， 古者谓之遁天之刑。适来 ， 夫子时也；适去 ， 夫子顺也。安时而处顺 哀乐不能人也 哀乐不能人也 ， 古者谓是帝之悬解。
指穷于为薪 ， 火传也 ， 不知其尽也。2
(ZHUANGZI, 1999, 46-47)
Death is nothing more in Taoist philosophy than the return movement to the great way, the Tao (道 道), as well explained in Chapter 40 of the Laozi Road and Virtue, or the “return” hexagra of the classic of mutations (易經), the classic founding of all others, or what some synologists called it, the philosophical “Bible” of the Chinese.  This hexagram of the "return" (復 fù), also called the "turning point" by Richard Wilhelm, is composed of the following trigarms, at the base the thunder (震 zhèn), initiator, and the top the earth (坤 kūn), affirming in the judgment of the hexagra that comes and go is the movement of the tao, it expands or returns, as its nature And therefore, there is always this possibility of starting any turning point sometimes to life sometimes for death. This hexagram is also associated with the image of a radius or thunder over the earth and the winter solstice, a natural period of major changes, in which the sun begins to grow on the horizon of the days. And will there be a greater change than that of life to death and from this to a new life, if to Taoism we add Buddhist hells and reincarnation in the various dimensions of being?
Read the judgment of the hexagram of the “return” (WILHELM, 1989, 97):
Return. Success.
Go out and enter without error
Friends come what there is nothing to censor.
Forward and backwards it is the way.
On the seventh day it returns.
It's always good to have where to go.
(復 ， 亨 ， 出入无疾 ， 朋來无咎 ， 反復其道 七日來復 ， ，) 3 （張, 1995,109）
As a result, it is found that in Chinese native philosophies as ancient as Taoism and the most remote, such as the one that comes exposed in the classic of mutations, there is no split between immanence and transcendence, life and death, there is a fluid process that runs endless, tireless and unenforceable, so death does not appear as a true problem.
But such a position of the most scholarly philosophy did not always coincide with popular philosophy, based on real myths and stories of seeking immortality, because although it was not supposed to be a true split between life and death, which are seen as the two complementary faces of a transformational process, the truth is that philosophers practiced exercises that, in the first and last analysis, had to lead them to longevity to the longevity. and the rulers followed the aforementioned example by trying to get rid of the natural process. The search for the pills of immortality was frequent not only in the deities as the Divine Archer Houyi (后羿 hòu yì) and his consort chang´e （嫦娥 tehang'é）, but also in more human figures.  The first Chinese emperor (秦始皇 Qín Shǐhuáng), the great uniform of Chinese territory, besides creating a legalistic bureaucratic system and facing Confucian wisdom and the literate with the burning of school books, pursued the worship of physical immortality through the search for elixires who had to live eternally. The tradition that has rushed death with the intake of highly toxic mercury -based elixions. And the pursuit of immortality, or at least the maximum longevity possible, remains a tradition within a popular philosophy that now defines itself as essentially secular, as reported by Reuters when in early September 2025 Russian presidents Vladimir Putin, North Korean Kim Jong Un were "caught" by a microphone that was inadvertently open to discuss issues of longevity. and immortality with Chinese President Xi Jinping (习近平 Xí Jìnpíng). The peaches of the immortality of the paradise of the West Queen of the West (西王母娘娘 xīwángmǔ Niángnáng) and, above all, the elixires manufactured by the Moon Rabbit (玉兔 Yùtù) compete today with other more scientific experiences, which include the possibility of organ transplantation for the creation of cyborg beings that may live 150 years, or more.
Thus, also the Chinese, from ancient to contemporaries, and scholarly philosophies aside, believe as popularly as possible that “heaven can wait,” so the longer they live here on Earth, the better.
With regard to the Portuguese, it will be unleashed that they sign underneath, and with more emphasis this position of Chinese popular philosophy. These are the faithful heirs of a strong Christian tradition, even when they say non -religious. They are in their cultural DNA a radical dichotomy between divine good and satanic evil, earthly immanence, full of errors and omissions, and the transcendence full of blessing. Therefore they cannot escape the images, however metaphorical they consider them, from heaven, hell, purgatory, etc. After all, even the most “intellectually evolved” consider that “the devil lurks”, “walks out” and, of course, is on the bad side of the world, the one in which the darkness in which the angels of the apocalypse will be sent all who have incorrectly proceeded in this existence. There will be a final judgment to which they will only escape the good and the righteous, those who have a pure heart like children or those who are “free from the law of death” through their “valuable works”, in the manner of the Camonian song.
But it is understood: good works do not get rid of physical death, only spiritual, only honor and fame will remain to all who have left their high mark in this world, as well suggested the saying of the best popular philosophy "death with honor, disassess." Now it will be interesting to see the Chinese correspondence, which is provided by Monsignor António André ngan in sino-Portuguese agreement of idioms and idioms (1998, 216) 視死如歸 (Shì Sǐ Rú Guī), which means in a literal translation for Chinese, “seeing death as a return”, but the truth is that this return has a very different meaning in China, where it is seen as something Body, physically turns to life, while the “disassombre” for the Portuguese means leaving the world of spiritual darkness to return to life, but in spirit, the only possible way for a liberation of the law of death.
Death and life form a pair of non -complementary opposites in the Portuguese. It means that death, "that does not expect," this one that "is always certain although the time is uncertain" does not depend on normal circumstances of Himself, but on God, for "only who God wants," according to the Christian tradition. Only God and Jesus have the possibility of rescuing death. They are on the side of life and eternal life, while death belongs to the kingdom of darkness and Satan. In the Book of Proverbs, 8, 35-36 is clearly affirmed regarding wisdom, "Whoever finds me finds life and enjoys the favor of Yahweh. Who loses me, arranges himself, for all who hate me love death."
Note that the vast majority of miracles performed by Jesus and the saints of the Catholic Church are miraculous healing and the resurrection of the dead, and can be described as times when the supernatural order intervenes in the natural order to free it from illness and death, and these extraordinary actions do not succeed everyone, but only to those who are fair and good, as well as their will, in which the demons were expelled.
For the Portuguese there is then to choose sides, through a wise stance, that is, acting correctly to be on the side of life so that when the end of time comes, as is predicted in the book of Revelation, each is judged according to their conduct (Rev. 20, 13-14) and so that the end of the history announced in this text of the apostle John can be transformed into life: “ Text ends with the promise of a new sky and land.
The big difference between Chinese and Portuguese philosophies about death is that the Chinese by tradition is allowed greater flexibility, life and death go hand in hand, they are part of the same process, so if death is certain, life is also guaranteed at the outset. They have the conceptual gadgets necessary to face the passing more at will and naturalness. Although many times throughout the history of this people, there has been a coexistence of postures, on the one hand, death is better accepted and, on certain schools, of taoistorist, even advises to face it with Gúudio, but on the other, one seeks to extend to the limit of the possible eyes not in a spiritual immortality to the Portuguese, but physical and concrete, either in the present via the present via the various experiences. scientific that the contemporary world favors.
Already the Portuguese, although also very closely trust in science and doctors, see and as parentheses the legitimate struggle for better health services, and have a language centered on "health", being the proverbial "how has passed?" The best of the examples of this, only very recently have been awakening to the exercises and practices of longevity, so in this respect the Chinese have greater advantages regarding healthy postures and the “manufacturing of elixires”; The compatriots never lose sight of the certainty that "death does not expect" and that "who has to die," even though those who have true faith believe in the possibility conditioned on the good works of an eternal life in a new world.
The Chinese will succeed the same with regard to good works, which will allow them according to Buddhist philosophy to reach Nirvana, or in their most popular aspects, reach a Buddha paradise, or, alternatively, return to Tao, diluting in an eternal present.

Emperor Wanli (1572-1620), named Zhu Yijun, had an underground palace built to be his tomb, whose value spent would allow feeding ten million people for a year. The decay was prevailed and the population lived in misery. He was forced to pay high incomes and fees, which led the peasants to revolt and take up arms to protect themselves.
In 1627 a peasant revolt began north of Shaanxi, which extended to Shanxi and Henan. In 1635, heads of armed groups of peasants met in Xingyang, Henan province, to plan a strategy. Li Zicheng, one of the leaders, with his army of peasants occupied Xian in 1644, and the entire province of Shaanxi, having formed the state of Dashun. Then he left east and passing by Shanxi and Hebei, began to Beijing, which led the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Chongzhen (1628-44), who was also called Zhu Yijun, taking refuge on Mount Wansui (Hill of Long Life), located in the northern part of the Imperial Palace. Then it was 43 days, but all efforts failed and without a solution to the complicated situation, the emperor hanged himself. China was out of imperial government for a few months, a period known for the interregnum Shun.
Ming troops fought the rioters peasants in many parts of China and a small ming cut moved to Nanjing, now with the name of Yingtian, creating the South Ming Dynasty.
The Manchus had their ancestors on the Nuzhen tribe, which in the Song had formed the Jin dynasty and lived in the Northeast many centuries from the mountains of Altai. In 1616, they joined the command of Nurhachi and in 1636, his son Huangtaiji formed the state of Qing. With an increasingly strong military body, he was preparing to invade China. For a long time, the Manchus troops were being parked along the borders with the territory of the Ming Dynasty.
General Ming, Wu Sangui, who ruled the passage of Shanhaiguan, surrendered to the Manchus and let them go through the great wall so that the Ming troops, together with the Manchus, to fight the rebels. Li Zicheng had to leave Beijing and, heading west, to Shanxi, was chased by the Manchus and Ming troops that had united. He was killed in Hubei, at the age of 39.
After the Manchus troops crossed the great wall with the help of Wu Sangui, they found China without a dynasty on the dragon throne a few months ago. In 1644, the Manchus occupied Beijing and stopped their capital, which until then was in Shenyang. Many Ming officers, who hitherto cooperated with the Manchus against the peasants, changed to their side, fighting the invaders Manchus.
With the last Emperor of the Ming Dynasty killed in 1644, the small Ming Court settled in Nanjing and then formed the South Ming Dynasty (1644-1662). Zhu Yousong, prince of Fu, becomes Emperor Hong Guang (1644-1645) and freed from the prison Zhu Yujian, convicted since 1636, when he was withdrawn the title of Prince of Tang.
Yingtian (Nanjing) was captured in June 1645 by the Qing forces and the ming court fled again. Divided into the South Ming Dynasty, part goes to Shaoxing (Zheijiang) and another refugee in Fuzhou, where Emperor Long Wu (1645 -1646) climbs, whose name was also Zhu Yujian, Prince of Tang. He belonged to the eighth descendant generation of the third son of the first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty and had the hope of being able to defeat the Manchus, who already formed the Qing Dynasty.
Macau and the Ming Resistance
With the antecedents explained, we come to the period of the story that interests us to study to recognize the character linked to the Ming who hides behind the god Zhu of Xian, whose belief of his protection has great power.
Until 1660 there was a resistance from the Chinese Han to the Manchus, where Macau has placed himself, sending several times military detachments, with cannons, to help the Ming Dynasty, which had opened the doors of the middle country.
In 1630, paid by the Ming Court, they departed from Macao four hundred Portuguese towards the Great Wall, but when they were in Jiangxi they were interrupted in their march due to the intrigue of Canton merchants with the provincial mandarins.
In 1643, a cannon and four top scorers are sent from Macau to Guangzhou and Nanjing, which between 1644 and 1645, receives the court that runs out after the Manchu invasion.
Following the conquest of Beijing by Manchus, the loyal forces to the Ming Dynasty again ask for help from the Portuguese and therefore, in 1646, Nicolau Ferreira joins the last southern Ming Emperor, Yang Li. He reigned for a period of fifteen years, being captured in early 1662, when the second Emperor Qing, Kang XI, had been in power for a year.
Macau remained faithful to Ming and good relationships with resistance forces, led since 1644 by Zheng Chenggong. Whether this name tells us little or nothing, the Coxinga is more recognized by those who use history, although both represent the same person.
Coxinga's name was given to Zheng Chenggong by the Dutch, who heard him in Taiwan from the mouth of the inhabitants of Fujian, where the mini dialect and the Kejia of the Hakka people, who called him Kok Sèng Iâ. Coxinga, whose birth name was Zheng Sen and then passed to Zheng Fu Song and only in 1645 moved to Zheng Chenggong, was the son of a former inhabitant of Macao, with the Christian name of Nicholas Gaspar. Coxinga's father, Zheng Zhilong (1604-61), born in Fujian, had spent some time as a young man in Macau, where he was converted and baptized. After recognizing the good money in trade, Nicholas Gaspar again as Zhilong, joined a group of pirates, who attacked mainly Dutch, headquartered in Taiwan and Chinese merchants, still making trade with Japan. And it is in Japanese Mother, who was born Zheng Fu Song's Zheng Sen (1624-83). The father, Zheng Zhilong in 1628 he was dedicated to the attack of Chinese Qing ships, fighting for Ming. Already his son, who had spent his first seven years of life in Japan, then will pick him up to be with him living in Fujian. At 15, Zheng Fu Song studied in Nanjing Guo Zhi Jian and in 1645, at the age of 21, studied at Beijing Guo Zhi Jian.
Zheng Zhilong was the most powerful ally of Emperor Long Wu (1645-1646) with whom he had a great friendship, since he had helped him to arrive at the emperor. By the faithfulness of both Zheng Zhilong and the son, the emperor, in Fuzhou, in 1645, attributes his family name, Zhu, Zheng Fu Song, which thus has the official name of Zhu Chenggong. Despite this name means “Zhu Success” in 1646, with the Qing Army victories in the center of China and Fujian, Emperor Long Wu on October 6 was captured and executed.
The Manchus bought Zheng Zhilong to be at their service and it accepts. His son, angry by the parent having passed to the Manchus hosts, refuses to abandon the Ming and with others from his father's group, ruled Fujian's back since 1646.
Emperor Longwu's younger brother, Zhu Yuyue, escaping by a boat from Fuzhou arrives in Guangzhou where he founded a Ming state, having on December 11, 1646 with the title of Shao Wu reign. But after a month, Li Chengdong, a former commander of the South Ming Dynasty, who led a small group of Qing troops, captured and killed Shao Wu. Little by little, the Qing dynasty occupies the entire Chinese territory.
The siege by the Manchus Guangzhou (Canton), which lasted ten months and ended on November 25, 1650, caused 70,000 dead. It was a great axed to Ming resistance that, in the eastern part of China, was confined only to the sea. Then, the armed commander, Zheng Chenggong, is defeated in 1659 at the Yangtzé River estuary. After this battle, Coxinga returns to Fujian and from there in front of 25,000 people to Taiwan, where after a nine -month siege take the island to the Dutch in April 1661. So many inhabitants of Fujian went to live in Taiwan.
In 1662, Zheng Chenggong died of illness at 38, but Taiwan only moves to the Qing dominance in 1683, when he is conquered to his grandson.
Coxinga behind Zhu da Xian
The history of this period, briefly presented here, transports us to Coxinga, a name given by the Dutch from what they heard from the Fujian Chinese call the Kok Sèng Iâ.
Analyzing the name Coxinga, which in Mandarin is Guo Xing Ye and in Cantonense, Kok Sèng Iâ, we have for Guo (国) the meaning of country, to Xing (姓) the family name and for Ye (爷), respectful way of calling an elder, an officer, the father or grandfather, the parents or grandparents, linked to the representation of power. This means that Kok Xing represents the nickname of the Emperor of China that was Zhu, in the Ming Dynasty.
In 1645, Emperor Long Wu gives Zheng Fu Song the name of Zhu and therefore had the official name of Zhu Chenggong, who wanted to mean "successful Ming Dynasty." It was only used in official documents and only the emperor could call him that, because Zhu was the nickname of those who ruled in the Ming Dynasty. Normally called by Zheng Guoxing and with greater respect Guo Xing Ye, the Zhu reference was hidden from this great character to the Ming Dynasty, especially when it was the Manchu Dynasty Qing that ruled.
The god Zhu of Xian, which means great immortal Zhu, is also connected with Fujian and both linked to the nickname Zhu, the family name of the ming emperors. Therefore, there seemed to be something to unite them, but because it could not be revealed, due to the Manchu dominion then the enemy of the Han, had to hide Coxinga on the cover of a god to worship him.
Still in the South Ming Dynasty, Emperor Yong Li (24/12/1646-20/1/1647) gave Zheng Chenggong the title of Yan Ping Wang.
Attempts to rehabilitate Ming Dynasty, the Manchus consolidated in power in China, when Zheng Guoxing's descendants wrote to the second Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Kangxi (1661-1722), asking Zhu Chenggong, who was in Taiwan, for the province of Fujian.
Emperor Kangxi wrote to them that, although Zhu Chenggong does not belong to his supporters, he allowed his body to come to Nan An in Fujian, his father's homeland Zheng Zhilong (1604-1661).
Since Zhu Chenggong was against the reigning Qing Dynasty, only narrated in the book Fujian Tong Zhi in 1737 in the period of the reign of Qianlong.
Lastly, our hypothesis of Zhu from Xian being Zhu Chenggong seems to be understood in 1875. Emperor Guangxu of the Qing dynasty, from the title of King Yan Ping awarded to Zhu Chenggong by the Ming Dynasty, passed him to God, Yan Ping Jun Wang. But since it did not belong to the supporters of this dynasty, it was called Zhu da Xian, thus hiding the name of Guo Xing Ye, which had great power. In the same year, the emperor offered the renewal of the Kai Shan Wang Temple, which has the god Yan Ping Jun Wang.
Thus we believe, with these little explanations, to be able to put this God, Zhu of Xian, Deity to Cushion.  We found in Macau the statue of Zhu da Xian in the Temple of Pau Kong, in Rua da Figueira.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>António Graça de Abreu</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/antonio-graca-abreu/</link><description>Text and Translation António Graça de Abreu
Writing about the nymphs and muses of Luís de Camões (oh, the Chinese dynamic of Camões!), Recently remembered my friend and editor Manuel S. Fonseca: “Who are the muses (from Os Lusíadas): will be a twenty Angelina Jolies or Scarlett Johassons to blow sweetness to the ear of Camões?”

I support me in the perfumes of your shoulder,
I drive it to silk covers,
Words, laughs in the light of the lamp.

午梦初回枕上春
香肩斜倚小罗裙
不知花外莺啼处
唤醒鸳鸯不许闻
Afternoon
The Seta of the afternoon, the dream,
The corner of spring on the pillow on the bed.
Your fragrant shoulders,
Still your thin silk skirt.
Among the flowers, the chilre of a nightingale,
in silence the mandarin ducks.
池上
柳丝低拂小金船
水面红莲照晚天
谁道风流多惹事
鸳鸯并浴最缠绵
On the lake
Salgueiro leaves
They caress the small golden boat,
In the lake, red lotus mirror the sky.
Love oscillates to the sun of the dusk.
the tenderness of the ducks mandarins,
a bath in the cleansing of the waters.

花影摇窗月半明
香房小坐话前情
低声怕惊帘外燕
偷将纤手入罗缨
The shadow of flowers
The window hidden in the shadow of the flowers,
A slight moonlight illuminates the night.
Lying in the fragrant room,
We talk about loves of the past,
In a low voice, not to scare the swallows.
Deviation to your delicate hand into the silk cord.
夜饮
灯下佳人笑语频
酒香微暖入罗巾
拥衾不觉鸡声起
窗外桃花又一春
Drinking at night
In light of Almotolia,
The beauty does not stop laughing, of speaking,
The odors of wine moist their embroidered scarf.
Embraced under the silk covers,
We didn't even hear the singing of the roosters.
Flower peaches announce another spring.
The empty room
I got sick last year during the fall rains,
Tomaste accounts for me for two months,
Exhausted, day and night in light of the lamp.
Winds blown from the West, I recovered my health,
but quiet your jade pins,
Sad the empty room, the window forever closed.
In the year 1754, Yuan Mei got sick with malaria. Concubine Tao, which the poet estimated very much, took care of him with enormous dedication. He died the following year, suddenly 29 years old. Yuan Mei then wrote six brief poems in his memory, one of them the latter translated here.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Lu Zhaolin (634-684), the poet of Fanyang (Youzhou) near the current Beijing, in the poem Changan Guyi, "Changan of Ancient Time", in which he expresses the melancholy longing of the splendor of the ancient capital of the Empire, evoked a familiar aquatic bird that, well as living freely, seems to have a voluntary commitment, his social behavior and his behavior has long been observed and praised. In the verses dezanove and twenty wrote:
We were the unique fish,
How would we escape death?
We can only be like the mandarin ducks,
No desires of immortality?
The Mandarin Patos (Aix Galericulata) whose designation Yuanyang reveals the union of two different, from the male and the Fémean, were pecebble as beings that showed the affection and marital fidelity, mating for a lifetime and as such copies for the stability of the social fabric. And as models can be seen in so many decorative objects for the home and, as can be read in the proverb, Chengyu, his conduct, a life goal: "Be like two mandarin ducks playing in water" (yuanyang xishui).
In the art of painting its richly colorful appearance would be reproduced in detail in the genus Niaohua, of "birds and flowers". But this was not the aquatic bird chosen in a horizontal roll made by Zhao Ji (1082-1135), the Emperor of the Song Huizong, who preferred the least exuberant, more vulgar brave duck (Anas Playrhynhos) Yeya, to appear in the admirable corners in the willow and brave ducks in the herbs (paint and color on paper, 223.2 x 34 cm, in the museum Shanghai).
From this duck the poets almost always underline their gregarious conduct, as in the poem of Du Fu (712-770) the lonely wild swan where, identifying with the swan, expresses a complaint because he feels neglected, and that ends with the verses: "Indifferent, the brave ducks challenged in clamor, confusing the shouts of the other birds everywhere." But it was not in a group but alone in his carefree existence, who was figured by a painter of the Yuan dynasty.
Chen Lin (c.1260-1368) made in a small horizontal roll (35.7 x 47.5 cm, ink and color on paper, at the National Palace Museum in Taipei) the figure of a duck isolated on the margin, near the river under hibiscus leaves, furong (Hibiscus mutabilis) whose flower, one of which is changed to the floor, is changing color, white to red.
The detail as the duck's feathers are figurative, in contrast to the rustic form of waves and leaves reveals a mutation in acting. And because of the ducks it is said that they are the first to detect the arrival of spring when experimenting with the water temperature, the impression of the passage of time is emphasized.
In an inscription on the painting, the poet and calcipr Qiu Yuan (1247-1326) says that it was made during a visit by the author to the studio of the famous painter Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) in the fall.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Elections | Campaign advances for the last days to the “Mpop” style</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/eleicoes-campanha-avanca-para-os-ultimos-dias-ao-estilo-mpop/</link><description>The elections for the Legislative Assembly are scheduled for the 14th, so the election campaign is almost over. In a report by Lusa agency, there are details of the “MPOP” style of the election campaign, with a lot of music and requests for financial support to the mixture
 
Crowded audience, all dressed in the gowns on the list with which they compete for the elections on the 14th; Chinese drums next to the stage and above candidates and supporters, various microphones, music and choreography. This is the campaign for Macao legislatures, in a style that can be called "MPOP".
The microphones change hands, reproducing the same slogans with different voices, in short and acute scales, which end almost all in a party instruction. At this point, the drums are listened to loudly and the audience reproduces the last note heard, while shaking the political 'merchandising' that is handed over to the start of the rally: plastic hands to clap, numbers on the list with led lights, malleable straws, fans, all with the same color.
Campaign actions in Macao, restricted to the last two weeks before legislative elections for the local parliament, do not contain speeches in the events of the six lists that will elect 14 of the 33 deputies to the Legislative Assembly (AL).
The remaining 12 candidates are chosen through the associations, through the indirect suffrage, and there are still seven deputies appointed by the Chief Executive, in this case Sam Hou Fai.
Describing campaign events is like an exercise of musical shows, namely the genus "Kpop", among the lists led by younger candidates, or the genre "pop old-myle", as if it was figures like Elvis or Olivia Newton John Risen.
The concentrations are made up of the members of the lists and the people mobilized by them, some and the other dresses with the same uniforms. But there are no politicians on stage and viewers listening to them.
In these events, politicians seem to be assumed as artists, but there are no audiences, because they seem to be part of the choreography. Finally, there are very few people besides and each other, that is, people watching who are not directly linked to the lists.
Abstention is the great ghost that hangs over the whole process, which takes place for the first time under the framework of the new Electoral Law of April 2024, which aims to "reinforce the implementation of the" Macao Macao governed by Patriotas "principle.
Economic challenges
Ilia Chou, 40, an employee of the financial sector, was with a child and a friend watching one of these rallies and seemed to be one of those few people present not involved in the campaign list. He agreed to talk to Lusa after he had spoken to another microphone.
Ilia was attracted to the list that was there because those people have a "young and community aspect" and are concerned with "offering prospects for progress" to young people. "Given the current challenging economic climate, we face a critical question: our young people now have fewer options than before. This specific aspect is what attracts me most in this initiative," he said.
But “other groups also talk about youth and employment, what are the differences? Why do you like this particular group?” We asked. "I don't know them [the other groups]. Well, I was attracted to the charming characters of this list," he replied. "I think these four characters quite charming," Ilia added, they talk about "love, the title is very charming, and the color is pink, it looks very welcoming."
Political programs are, without exception, lists of requests to an “provider father”, incarnated by the executive, who has the responsibility of managing a comfortable and growing financial reserve, fueled by taxes paid by the six game dealers in Macao.
The numbers show this comfort. In August, the Macao Financial Reserve, which was always growing throughout the first half, reached 647.3 billion patacas, and was applied in subcontracted investments, deposits, current accounts, and credit securities.
Lists want to be applied to initiatives such as the creation of a development fund and the reversal of 10 percent profits for distribution by all citizens, want to increase pensions or more money in consumer coupons, subsidies and maternity licenses, want more social housing, want free health and higher education, or simply require greater annual money distribution.
Pasta
There are also other requirements, such as promoting the diversification of the economy, measures to support the transformation and modernization of small and medium -sized enterprises or development of the intelligent city, but the most significant part of the six lists shows directly to the government's distribution of money in the most varied forms.
The other recipients of the requests are the game dealers, to which the candidates go with warnings that they are determined to defend the priority of residents in access to the best paid jobs.
Macao's unemployment rate is 2 percent and permanent residents at 2.6 percent. That is, technically, Macau has full employment. However, as Lusa told a candidate, the employment issue has nothing to do with statistics, it just holds on with "perception."
And in fact the question of unemployment, especially those who have just graduated, is a pressing issue of political programs, as HM indicated. This is the case of the first list to compete for direct suffrage, the “Association of United Citizens of Macao”, which is led by Song Pek Kei, a deputy linked to the Fujian community, who took the first steps in politics alongside businessman Chan Meng Kam.
The list led by the deputy asks, for example, the creation of a share for residents in all professional areas, “support for jobs and local companies”, and the guarantee that “85 percent, or more, employees are local residents”.
The Nova Esperança list, led by José Pereira Coutinho, and one of the few macanese participants in these elections, asks for “employment for all”, a slogan present in his electoral program where the “employment priority for Macao's permanent residents is promised at game dealers”.
Who goes out to their
List campaigns for indirect suffrage may seem more discreet, but that doesn't mean there is no news. After investing in Global Media, Portugal, and betting on the real estate area, in Porto, Kevin Ho, the nephew of the first chief executive, Edmund Ho, bet on local politics, when entering the list “Union of Macao Business Interests”, led by José Chui Sa Peng. Also he is familiar, in this case, from a previous head of the Executive of MSAR, Chui Sai On, already removed from the political scene.
In the case of these lists, representative of the sectors of labor, culture, education or business interests, employment is a concern, but what the candidates are looking for is a government that can support companies and finally diversify the economy.
Thus, in the “union of business interests of Macao”, it is advocated “support for digital and high technology transformation to modernize traditional industries and develop emerging sectors”. Candidates promise to play the role of intermediaries between those who have difficulty maintaining in this business fabric and the executive by “listening carefully to the difficulties and claims of the commercial and financial industries, especially small and medium enterprises”. The names of the seven appointed deputies are not yet known, as the Chief Executive's choice is usually made public only after the elections.

The authorities in the neighboring region have long called for the withdrawal, including official visits to Portugal. The Portugal-Hong Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kong emphasizes the decision consistent with the position of the European Union
 
The Hong Kong government has finally seen the desire, expressed several times, to leave the list of tax havens in Portugal. The change will be a reality from January 1, 2026, taking into account the ordinance published on Friday by the Ministry of Finance in the Diário da República.
According to this document, Hong Kong is no longer included in the list of “clearly more favorable tax regimes”, the official name of the list commonly known as the “Fiscal Paradise List”.
It reads at the Ordinance, signed by the Secretary of State for Tax Affairs, Claudia Reis Duarte, that “the governments of the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the East Republic of Uruguay drove formal requests” to the “revision of their framing in the list, which were the subject of positive opinions elaborated by the Tax and Customs Authority”. The removal of these three countries and territories is officially on January 1 of next year.
Thus, the Portuguese Government considers that the conditions are verified to, in the legally established terms, exclude those jurisdictions from the list of countries, territories or regions with clearly more favorable tax regimes ”.
It is also noteworthy that “the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay are not on the European Union of Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction List, adopted by the European Union Council, which took place on February 18, 2025”.
It is recalled that one of the last times that Hong Kong made a formal request to leave the list of tax havens was during the visit to Lisbon of the Secretary for Financial and Treasury Services, Christopher Hui Ching-Yu, last year, as a meeting with Secretary of State Claudia Reis Durte.
There, and according to Lusa, the ruler of the neighboring region "expressed concern" for Hong Kong being considered a fiscal paradise since the list was created by the Portuguese authorities in 2004.
The inclusion in the list “would subject Hong Kong companies to a tax increase and special measures” in Portugal, described the ruler, who recalled that the two parties signed an agreement to prevent double taxation, which came into force in 2012.
In the same meeting, Christopher Hui reminded the Portuguese Secretary of State that the European Union (EU) removed, in February 2024, Raehk from the non -cooperative jurisdiction list for tax purposes, a decision that, in the secretary's understanding, "demonstrated the recognition of the EU of Hong Kong's efforts" to introduce measures that combat "the [fiscal] transfronio evasion resulting from the pair not the pair not taxation ”. Christopher Hui added that Hong Kong already fulfilled all European standards in this matter.
It should be noted that, at the time, the Portuguese Minister of the Economy was Pedro Reis, who at an event about Christopher Hui's visit to Lisbon, said it was important to “maintain sustainable economic growth and take advantage of the opportunities for mutual investment” between Portugal and Hong Kong.
Chamber of Commerce Rejubila
However, the Portugal-Hong Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kong (PHKCCI, in the English acronym) issued a note in LinkedIn to highlight Hong Kong's exit from this list. "This milestone represents the culmination of a long-term and transverse process in Portugal, which involved continuous dialogue and coordination between successive governments, parliamentary parties and international partners. Although the consensus on the objective was solid, the process has gradually unfolded over more than a decade," he reads.
For PHKCCI, the Portuguese State decision “restores coherence with the European Union's rules and reflects Portugal's commitment to a fair and current approach to its tax governance”, also stressing the “importance of respecting objective criteria, maintaining a permanent dialogue and ensuring legal and diplomatic rigor in the management of fiscal policy”.
“As a chamber of commerce and industry Portugal-Hong Kong, we greeted this outcome as a step forward in the alignment of our bilateral environment of commerce and investment with predictability, transparency and good governance. We maintain committed to facilitating constructive involvement between our markets, supporting the clarity in tax staff and fostering mutual confidence”, is referred to in the same note.
According to the online newspaper Eco, the inclusion of a country or territory on the list of tax havens happens if there is no tax similar to IRC [tax on the income of legal persons], charged in Portugal, or the existence of tax benefits that are more favorable than in the European country.
It also serves as a criterion for inclusion in the list administrative practices of countries or regions do not allow the effective exchange of tax information. All issues that Hong Kong considers to have exceeded and ensure that there is full respect for the fight against fiscal dropout.
More concretely, and when his visit to Portugal last year, Secretary Christopher Hui spoke of the “Hong Kong efforts in the introduction of a foreign source performance regime (FSIE) for certain passive income to better combat transionic dropout resulting from the non -taxation”. In his view, "such efforts fully aligned the Hong Kong FSIE regime with FSIE regimes updated by the EU regimes in December 2022".
MEXIDES IN FSIE
According to an explanatory note from consultant PriceWaterhousecoopers (PWC), Hong Kong was added to the EU Observation list in October 2021. On that date, the EU was concerned that, under the then Foreign Source Exemption Scheme (FSIE), there could be situations in which companies without substantial economic activity in Hong Kong would not be subject to Tax regarding certain passive income from a foreign source (such as interest and royalties), thus resulting in situations of 'double non-tax', ”can be read.
The following year, Raehk "promulgated legislative changes", namely in December 2022, to "improve and reinforce the FSIE regime against transfronical fiscal evasion."
With the changes in force since 1 January 2023, “the four types of foreign source income”, such as dividends, interest, intellectual property income and alienation gains from the sale of corporate interests, are “being considered origin in Hong Kong and subject to profit tax if received in Hong Kong by an entity of a multinational group that exercises trade, profession or business in the business Territory, ”explains PWC,“ except if this entity meets the requirements of the applicable exception ”.
After the EU's suggestion, “the Raehk government further perfected the FSIE regime to widen the scope of incomes, including alienation gains from other types of assets (beyond corporate appearances) in order to align with the latest EU orientation, with effect from 1 January 2024”.
It was then that on February 20 last year the EU council published the conclusions of the semiannual EU review regarding the “non -cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes”, the so -called “black list” of tax havens, as well as the “observation list” regarding the “state of cooperation with the EU in relation to the commitments made by cooperative jurisdictions to implement principles of good tax governance”.
At that time Hong Kong was taken from the list, considering the EU that the territory had "fulfilled the commitment by changing the FSIE regime", highlighting PWC, in the same note, that Raehk is now "among the jurisdictions that cooperate with the EU and do not have pending commitments."
According to PWC, "the Raehk government greeted the recognition of the EU of efforts to align its FSIE regime with the relevant requirements, as reflected in its removal from the EU observation list", and will also have "will continue to comply with international tax standards, while maintaining Hong Kong fiscal competitiveness."</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 02:09:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Political programs focused on the economy and social support</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/05/eleicoes-programas-politicos-com-foco-na-economia-e-apoios-sociais/</link><description>There are six lists of candidates for deputies by Via Direct, and another six by the way indirect. There are new guys, many out of departure and even deputies who decided to wander among suffrage. The main focuses of political programs continue to be employment, the promotion of the economy and the increase in social support
 
On September 14 will be chosen the deputies of the Legislative Assembly (AL), either by the vote of the people, in the direct via or by indirect way through the associations that represent the various professional sectors. The campaign is on the streets and the 12 lists have made available electoral programs whose content does not differ much from the interpeairs presented to the government in recent years, given that most of the list heads have been in AL for some time.
Thus, issues such as the crisis in youth employment, the incentive for local consumption, the need for more social support and macao regional integration in Hengqin and the Great Bay dominate the measures presented.
In the case of list 1, the “Association of United Citizens of Macao” has roots in Fujian and is led by Mrs Song Pek Kei, who started very young to accompany businessman Chan Meng Kam in parliamentary Lides. Now he is accompanied by the young deputy Nick Lei, followed in third place, and on a list of ten people, Chan Lai Kei.
In the work area, the list defends the creation of a share for residents in all professional areas, “support for employment and local companies”, and the guarantee that “85 percent, or more, of employees are local residents”.
It is also advocated the release of “vacancies in the financial and management areas for qualified residents”, as well as the granting of a subsidy of five thousand patacas for “each resident eligible in employment support, unemployed or temporary workers”.
The Nova Esperança list, led by José Pereira Coutinho, wants “employment for all” and promises to fight for “Macao's permanent residents priority at game dealers” and the establishment of a “compulsory system (pension fund), which protects 100 percent to the population”.
The electoral program also emphasizes the area of ​​game promoters, whose number of licenses has fallen by the last years. The list calls for “reinforcement of its viability by increasing the legal commission from 1.25 to 1.30 percent” and “facilitation of opening bank accounts for licenses” junket attributed by the executive.
In the case of list 3, the Promoting Union for Progress, which represents the General Union of Macao residents' associations, led by Deputy Leong Hong Sai, asks for “improving the use of residents”, tourism revitalization or support for “small and medium enterprises”.
List 5, the union for development, is led by a well -known al face. Ella Lei and the workers' bench partner Leong Sun Iok again put their jobs as a political priority.
The “guarantee of employment opportunities to local” is asked, as well as the “improvement of the entry and exits system of foreign workers”.
The list of workers promises to fight for the development of “paid training to increase the qualifications of local workers”, as well as “improvement of the employment support system, properly increasing the allocation of services”.
Also in the work area, this group of candidates asks to be “improved the workers protection system to increase their living”, suggesting the “strengthening of the salary structure” and the “social security system to increase workers' protection level”.
Consuming it is necessary
Since Macao has recovered from the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the closing of business, which another problem has placed: the fact that it is easier to travel to China has made residents consume less in the territory, affecting the trade in less tourist areas.
This has been a recurring theme in the interventions of deputies in AL and is also in the electoral programs. Returning to the list linked to the Fujian community, “incentives for domestic consumption” are asked to “reduce pressure on residents' lives” and “revitalize the local economy”. For this should be followed "the experiences of consumption support programs between 2020 and 2022, creating new consumer cards to stimulate trade."
In the case of Pereira Coutinho's list, the institution is defended “an electronic annual support card for the consumption of 10,000 patacas”, and the candidate even calls for the creation of a permanent cash planning plan with the value from 15,000.
The workers also ask "the stimulus to consumption in order to help residents spend and boost the economy."
In the case of Macao-Guangdong Union 4, representing the Jiangmen Naturals, and led by the academic Joey Lao Chi Ngai, it is asked to “promote the operation of a 'coordination working group for employment promotion, in order to boost the social mobility of residents.” It is also suggested to review “several social security regimes, and investment in resources to support the elderly, children, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups”.
Rómulo Santos
Joey Lao
Consumption is not forgotten
With regard to the executive's subsidies to the so -called most vulnerable layers of the population, children, young people, the elderly, chronic patients or disabled people, all lists ask for more.
In the case of the group led by Song Pek Kei it is suggested to conduct a study “on the creation of a universal health insurance system to ensure free basic medical services for all residents”. It is also asked for a “better use of resources to expand coverage of medical services and reduce families' burden” in this area. It should be noted that the Executive, in addition to complying with moderating rates for residents, also assigns health valleys worth six thousand patacas for residents.
Song Pek Kei's list takes one of Sam Hou Fai's latest measures, the creation of a childhood allowance to ask for its extension from three to six years of the beneficiary. The creation of “differentiated subsidies for the second and third children” is also advocated, as well as a 90-day maternity leave to increase the birth rate.
Looking at the New Hope list, the news is the request for conversion “of the current [health] benefits to multifunctional consumption valleys with the value of 10,000 patacas”, as well as the expansion of the maternity leave to 90 days. In the case of childhood subsidy, the New Hope defends its extension up to the child's 12 years and a monthly payment of 2,000 patacas.
Also noteworthy is to defend the increase in the allowance to informal caregivers and monoparent families from 5,000 to 8,000 monthly patacas. Given that Coutinho is linked to the Association of Macao Public Function Workers, this is an area that is paid attention to this political program: increase, between 30 and 50 percent, “from the base remuneration, replacing the 100 points of the Indicion Table, to the agents of the security forces”, also defending the “voluntary retirement after 20 years of service”.
In the case of list 6, a good home alliance, led by Wong Kit Cheng, the most and better measures are made for parents: “increase the number of parental licenses and monitoring to prenatal exams”, it reads, also the defense of “more flexible working hours and tax deductions by the number of children in charge”.
In an overview of the programs, it should be noted that in six lists of direct suffrage, only the new hope list uses the two official, Portuguese and Chinese languages. In the indirect suffrage there are more groups to make this bet, such as the union of the business interests of Macau and the union of the interests of Macao professionals. There are no English programs. These elections are based on the departure of deputies such as Ron Lam U Tou, Chak Mo, Chan Hong and Lei Chan U.
What indirects want
In the indirect suffrage there is a novelty: the entry of businessman Kevin Ho, nephew of Edmund Ho, to the list led by José Chui Sa Peng, the “Union of Macau Business Interests”, which represents the industrial, commercial and financial sectors. Highlight, in this group, for the entry of Si Ka Lon, which always competed by the way. This group advocates “support for digital and high -tech transformation to modernize traditional industries and develop emerging sectors”, also promising to “listen carefully to the difficulties and claims of commercial and financial industries, especially small and medium -sized companies”.
Kevin Ho
The union of the interests of Macao professionals, led by Iau Teng Pio, a subdirector of the Faculty of Law of the University of Macao, defends the struggle for the “training of the diversification of the economy in accordance with professional strength” and “the articulation of the rules of Macau and Hengqin”. To this end, it suggests the creation of an “experimental zone of application” of these same norms, exploring “a direct and transfronical execution mechanism of arbitration”. Following is the desire to “strengthen international competitiveness of law”, encouraging “exceptional talents to study in the interior of China”.
A face for education
Ho Ion Sang, a face that we got used to in direct suffrage, competes again for the indirect suffrage alone, representing the education sector, with the Association of Promotion of Social Service and Education.
The candidate calls for the “implementation of mental health support measures” as well as “improving the overall quality of Macao medical services and effectiveness in care”. Ho Ion Sang promises to fight for measures that look “the impact of low birth in the education system” and more “support for inclusive education and special education schools”.
The businesswoman Angela Leong joins the first time to MA Chi Seng to compete for the Cultural and Sports Union of Sol Nascente, in defense of culture and sport. One of the ideas is “asking the government to guide the use of the free -related elements [of the concessionaires] to support local cultural and sports activities”.
In the “Joint Commission of the Associations of Employees”, led by Deputy Lam Lon Wai, it is defended the improvement of infrastructure, the “reduction of business costs and the facilitation of trade and investment”. The promotion of the “sharing the benefits of economic development with employees” is asked, stabilizing a “salary growth mechanism”.
In the union of workers' associations, led by Leong Pou U and Choi Kam Fu, it is suggested “improving the protection of work and workers”, as well as “the protection of the basic rights of workers, improving infrastructure of child support”. The “dynamic adjustment of the minimum wage to ensure basic life needs” is also advocated.</description><pubDate>2025-09-05 00:01:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinema | Hong Kong Movies Shown for the second time in Lisbon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/11/cinema-filmes-de-hong-kong-exibidos-pela-segunda-vez-em-lisboa/</link><description>Former resident of Macau Vanessa Pimentel is the artistic director of the second edition of the Hong Kong Film Festival, which will take place from 25 to 28 September at the Ideal Cinema in Lisbon. "Making Waves - Navigators of Hong Kong" will present films like "Papa", the documentary "Four Trails" and the restored copy of "Ah Ying", 1983
 
There are six films, four fiction and two documentaries, which promise to show the best of the best in Hong Kong cinema. This is the second edition of the Hong Kong Film Festival, in Lisbon, at the ideal cinema, between 25 and 28 September, which has as artistic director Vanessa Pimentel, also she director, former resident of Macau linked to producer Blue Lotus Lisboa.
In addition to the exhibitions, the Portuguese public will be able to closely see Hong Kong actors, directors and producers, in a proof that it is possible to establish ties between Portugal and different cinematic environments. This year's poster consists of “Papa”, a 2024 film by director Philip Yung that will be screened on the 25th, a Thursday. Follows Ray Yueng's “All Shall Be Well”; Rikki Choy's “Never Too Late”; Montages of A Chan Oliver Siu Kuen; Four Trails, a 2023 documentary directed by Robin Lee. To end the beauty festival, the restored copy of Allen Fong's “Ah Ying” will be projected from “Ah Ying”, a 1983 movie.
Vanessa Pimentel explained to HM that the show has “a program that comes from Hong Kong”, where it has been around since 2022. “It is a itinerant program that aims to promote Hong Kong cinema, especially the cinema made by younger filmmakers, although programs always contain more veteran performance works,” he said.
This year, besides Lisbon, the Hong Kong Film Festival will pass through cities such as Berlin, Paris, Montreal and Udine, Italy. The event may be linked to Asian movie festivals or not. And it's the intention of Vanessa and Blue Lotus to create an Asian Film Festival in Lisbon, and Macau cinema will be part of it.
"In our case, the show is not associated with any festival because it does not yet exist, but I hope to be able to do so," he said. “I was born and raised in Lisbon, but I come from Macau, and my life from Macau is very close to all this. Of course an Asian Film Festival in Lisbon has to include Macau, nor could it be otherwise.”
“We do this program with a view to going a little further, and we are putting on an eye on the creation of an Asian Film Festival,” he said. "We haven't done it yet, we have to continue to work, but I think we're on the way."
Vanessa Pimentel says that, although she no longer lives in the territory, she is still very linked to the cinema that is done here. “I'm going to Macau at least twice a year, and I've been in permanent contact with movie people. They are all aware of our program [at the Hong Kong movie show] and there is a relationship.”
Film
We ask the artistic director of the show to talk about what the public can see in the small room of the ideal cinema, which works independently, without connection with large film screenings, which is located in the heart of Bairro Alto.
"Papa", which opens the festival, is described "as a very strong and good movie that talks about mental health and has an amazing approach." Vanessa Pimentel describes that this movie was awarded in Hong Kong with the distinction of best actor, presenting themselves throughout the plot "a very particular narrative."
“All Shall Be Well” is again shown in Lisbon, after the presentation at the Queer International Film Festival, and has passed Berlin. “It's a very good movie, there was no more screening after being in Berlin, I thought it would be interesting to put it on the program.”
Vanessa Pimentel also highlights the presentation of the restored copy of "Ah Ying", which belongs "to the new place of Hong Kong cinema", which shows a story that wanders incessantly between "fiction and documentary." It is a "very interesting movie in which the story is inspired by the story of the actress's own [Hui So Ying] who plays him."
The second show of Hong Kong's cinema will be attended by Hui So Ying. "It's a great honor because the actress will make a giant trip. She is already some age, but has soon came to come. It will be very interesting to have a movie inspired by her life and count on her presence to share with us this moment," said Vanessa Pimentel.
Little known paths
Another highlight of the Film Show is the exhibition of the documentary “Four Trails”, which has been “a ticket phenomenon”. It is a movie about the 298-kilometer race for the four best known Hong Kong tracks.
The film portrays a daily reality "from the Hong Kong regions that almost no one knows." "It's a movie about the challenge of sports and people who, not being professional sportsmen, sign up and run, training all year long. It's interesting to see the challenge they propose and how they live," said Vanessa Pimentel, who also highlights "Never Too Late", "A movie about our relationship with the environment." Here one can glimpse "a very Asian and Chinese side of this perspective of what the environment is and what our relationship with nature is like."
There is later the "Montage of A Modern Motherhood", a movie that "has shot the festivals a lot." “It's a movie that has a very interesting side, about motherhood and a perspective that, perhaps, may not be so romantic, about the idea that maternity is not just a sea of ​​roses, having any reverse,” says Vanessa Pimentel.
Here the artistic director of the show warns that the film “can challenge a little,” playing “in things that concern everyone, like this thing of family tradition and sharing in motherhood and paternity”.
Vanessa Pimentel assures that the first edition of the show was a success, with "about a thousand people going to the cinema in four days." "It was surprising to see a lot of new people, older and also many people of Chinese origin, that is, children of immigrants, eventually a second generation, who were born in Lisbon, speak Portuguese and live here with families. We had sessions with many Chinese to ask questions at the end of the sessions and had never seen it in Lisbon," he said.
Hong Kong's cinema show also comes to the script of viewers who usually go to festivals. "We have a very interesting audience, consisting of people who like cinema and go to other festivals. It is not often to see a program that, in Lisbon, focuses on Asian cinema. We have Doc Lisboa, or Indie, but in its programming the proportion of this cinema is much smaller.
Between the Hong Kong Film Festival and the future festival, the official says there is “exhibition space” in Lisbon and Portugal, because the Asian cinema is “very vast and rich, having a very high amount and quality relationship”.</description><pubDate>2025-09-11 23:54:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Visit | Montenegro believes in “more agile” visas regime for Portuguese</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/10/visita-montenegro-acredita-em-regime-de-vistos-mais-agil-para-portugueses/</link><description>On a visit to Macau, which lasted only a few hours, the Portuguese government leader was confident in a new regime to speed up the coming from Portuguese to Macau. Montenegro also praised the development of the territory and spoke at a “very positive” phase of the relations between Portugal and Macau
 
Portugal Prime Minister Luís Montenegro believes that the MSar will create a “more agile” regime for Portuguese citizens. The statements were made yesterday to journalists, when Montenegro was confronted that the Misrem had eliminated the attribution of a preferential regime for Portuguese citizens in accessing the resident identity ticket.

"We have a concern regarding the visas of residence of all those [Portuguese] who go to this territory with desire to work and to help the institutions can do their work," acknowledged the leader of the Government of Portugal. "Our staff are in contact and has been combined following what had already begun with the visit of the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, last March, […] I think things will be sent so that we can have the consecration of a more agile, easier, more experienced regime, and therefore, that we know that we know," he added.
When asked if the regime would be the same as applied before the Ho Iat Seng government propose its elimination, approved by the Legislative Assembly, Montenegro refused to enter details. "I cannot now be entering this detail. What we want, from the point of view of the authorities on both sides, is that all this dynamic is as easy as possible and, therefore, that the rules are fast and also so as not to disagree with this [Portuguese Portuguese] mobility that is positive mobility," he said.
Positive phase of cooperation
Montenegro also considered that he felt like the side of Macau to continue to receive Portuguese. "I believe yes [that there is a desire to have Portuguese in Macau], I think it was very clear from the conversation we had," he said.
As for the relationships between Portugal and Macau, Montenegro considered that they cross “a very positive phase” of cooperation, in the level of the economic, social, cultural and historical and entity aspects.
"We have registered a very strong commitment of the Macao Executive in the preservation of architectural heritage, of the historical heritage, which is also part of what is the identity of Macao," he said. "We want, in fact, that there will be compliance with a mutual cooperation relationship, which is based on the documents that have presided over the transition […] and that attributes responsibilities to all. And we will be up to our [responsibilities] and, of course, to request compliance with others," he added.
Some obstacles
Regarding the situation of Macao, Montenegro claimed to be “a good example”, although with some “obstacles” and “tensions”, which explained to be normal of these kinds of regions.
"I think that in global this is a good example of how it was possible to organize a transition process, to safeguard the most relevant interests in presence and contribute to the economic and social development of this territory," said the Prime Minister of Portugal. Numbers, although they do not express everything, are a good instrument for us to be able to gauge the economic and social success of this route and this process that is not free of tensions, is not free of obstacles. It is like in all processes that imply changes, something that is never truly finished and impels us to be pro-action, ”he shot. The leader of the government of Portugal did not specify the" obstacles "or the" tensions. "
Off the agenda
Speaking to journalists, Montenegro also addressed the case of the detention of former deputy Au Kam San, who also has Portuguese nationality. The Prime Minister revealed that the case was not part of the schedule of this trip and must be treated with discretion. "It was not the subject of our conversation, but it is a subject, this and others, which we follow and that we promote with the necessary description, because there are some subjects that also deserve some modesty in treatment. And this is one of them," he explained.
Montenegro also refused to explain whether there was any movement to support the detainee. "We are not discussing this case, I will not particularize. In this context of the visit, what I want to reiterate is our firm purpose in bringing our cooperation relationship to the most varied levels and the preservation of a connection that has been fruit, despite having its problems," he said.
Sam Hou Fai guarantees Portuguese rights
The chief executive stated that the government of Macao attributes great importance to the rights and traditions of Portuguese resident in the territory. Sam Hou Fai's statements were made yesterday morning when he received Luís Montenegro, according to the Communication Office (GCS).

Security | Montenegro's visit with great apparatus
Unlike visits by other Portuguese leaders Macao, as happened with Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, in 2019, Luís Montenegro's passage was marked by a large security apparatus, which was guaranteed by a team with security guards and Chinese agents, as well as the forces of the mashes. Before the Prime Minister of Portugal arrived at the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM), all who wanted to be inside the institution had to be searched. Also journalists or image reporters who had not registered beforehand could not enter.
Inside the institution there was also a dog accompanying one of the agents. Outside the school, when the car that carried Montenegro arrived, police warded the passers -by and prevented the passage. During the stop of the Montenegro car, the car was being protected by a higher van that stopped next to it to block one of the angles of vision. After passing the EPM, the area between the consulate of Portugal and the Sé Zone was full of security agents.
Culture | Montenegro highlights Portuguese “values”
During the speech of the reception to the Portuguese community, Luís Montenegro highlighted the “values” brought by the community in Macao, and in the principal the diffusion of the language.

Official visit to China, with Macau, Luís Montenegro stressed China's fundamental role in the global context
 
The Portuguese Prime Minister said yesterday, before the President of the Popular Republic of China, Xi Jinping, who has his close relationship with Russia to “build a fair and lasting peace” in Ukraine.
Luís Montenegro made these statements at the beginning of the first day of the official visit to China, during the meeting with Xi Jinping, of which journalists could only record the first three minutes. "I can not help, on behalf of the government of Portugal, to transmit to the President that we count a lot with your contribution and the close relationship that China maintains with the Russian Federation to be able, as fast as possible, build just and lasting peace in Ukraine," he said.

Montenegro said he was confident that the appeal he addressed to the president of China about the Russian-Ukraine conflict will be heard. "I believe that the appeal, coming from a friendly country, coming from a European Union (EU) country, coming from a country, such as Mr. President XI Jinping also emphasized, who has an identity of values ​​and route, will not fall into a rotor bag," he said.
Saying not being able to answer for the president of China, Montenegro expressed convinced that Portugal has done what is required to this conflict.
"My conviction is that, to our dimension and without any kind of pretentiousness, we do what is required to a nation with history and the international respectability that Portugal has. We are builders of bridges, we are protagonists of the approach between peoples, we are advocates of peace, defenders of values, respect for people's rights," he said.
Montenegro considered that, at the meeting with Xi Jinping, he was limited to “being frank, loyal and direct in the appeal” so that China's ability to influence and “bring practical results” to Ukraine.
Luís Montenegro also mentioned that “it is very tasteful” that he makes this official visit to China, after brief statements by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
"As Mr. President said, Portugal and China have a relationship founded on a story that has shared with various times in common, but also a relationship facing the future. I remember Mr. President's visit to Portugal for seven years and I also want to convey the greetings of Mr. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa," he said.
Good friends
The Portuguese Prime Minister expressed agreement with the words of Xi Jinping about how the transition from the administration of Macao de Portugal to China in 1999 took place.
"We had in the transition from Macau a good expression of the way we were able to converge and we managed to ensure the cultural identity and the relationship between the special administrative region of Macau, with Portugal and with China," he said.
At yesterday's meeting, Xi Jinping said that “Portugal is a good friend of China”, saying that it is “a pleasure” to meet the Prime Minister, Luís Montenegro.
“Welcome on the visit to China. I remember that in 2018 I made a state visit to Portugal, which made me a beautiful impression, and deep,” he said, taking the opportunity to ask Montenegro to transmit to the Portuguese head of state, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, “sincere greetings”, according to the simultaneous translation into Portuguese of his statements.
The Chinese president stressed that China and Portugal "are countries with deep history, and the two peoples have idiosyncrasy, openness, inclusion, progress and autonomy", arguing that "Portugal plays an important and unique role on the international stage."
Xi Jinping also highlighted “the important role” played by three former Portuguese prime ministers in international and regional affairs.
"The Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres, the president of the European Council, António Costa, and the former president of the European Commission Durão Barroso. I have good relations with them," he said.
In the brief statement, the Chinese president stated that "Portugal is a good friend of China" and considered that both countries have "properly resolved" the issue of Macao through friendly negotiations. "
"Portugal was also the first country in Western Europe to sign with China acts of cooperation under the initiative" a track, a route ", and the first country in the euro zone that issued titles" in the Chinese currency, he said.
A little help in the crisis
In turn, Luís Montenegro thanked China for the support of Portugal during the period of the financial crisis. "At the level of our bilateral economic cooperation, it is my duty to tell you that we do not forget, on the contrary, we have very well present and respect the bet that China has developed in the Portuguese economy, in one of the most critical moments of our country, when the financial crisis," he said.
As had been highlighted moments earlier by the President of the Popular Republic of China, Montenegro also considered that, in recent years, the two countries have reinforced ties "in various sectors of the economy, from energy to bank, from health to water supply." "Our conviction is that we can continue to walk this path on the basis of trust," said the prime minister.
Luís Montenegro landed in Beijing early Monday afternoon, closed to the media, and did not have any public agenda that day. The prime minister's official agenda began yesterday morning with a ceremony of deposition of a wreath at the monument to the people of the people, in Tiananmen Square, where he was accompanied by his wife and three ministers who are part of this visit: Paulo Rangel, Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, Manuel Castro Almeida, Minister of Economics and Territorial Cohesion, and Graça Carvalho, Minister of Environment and Energy.
In addition to the meeting with Xi Jinping, Luís Montenegro met first with the president of the China National Popular Assembly, Zhao Leji.
In the late afternoon, the head of the Portuguese government had a work meeting with the Chinese counterpart, I read Qiang, also in the Great Palace of the People, having followed to Macao, where he has today schedule only in the morning. Tomorrow and Friday, Montenegro will make an official visit to Japan, with tickets for Tokyo and Osaka.
Pilfe
At HM, analyst Tiago André Lopes, an auxiliary professor responsible for Asia Study at Lusíada do Porto University, argued that “Lisbon and Beijing share quite different views regarding international conflicts”. It should be noted that Montenegro visits China when they spend a few days about the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which took place in the Chinese town of Tianjin, and where conflicts were discussed Gaza or Russia-Ucrania.
"We can see that Lisbon is distinctive in the Palestinian issue, looking little uncomfortable with the barbarism that is slaughtered over the Palestinians; while China positions itself in a different spectrum from Portugal in the Ukraine War. What does this tell us? The trip will be very focused on the dimension of economic diplomacy and much less in the so -called traditional diplomacy," said the analyst.
Tiago André Lopes considers that Portugal could take advantage of this trip through Asia "to self-admit some of the dependence on the Brussels-Washington axis and gain space for maneuver by integrating Beijing's Force," although "the current government bets on an atlanticism-Europeist without global ambitions."
Asked about the issue of 5G, which guided the Portugal-China relationship in recent months, Tiago André Lopes understands that Montenegro's trip to Beijing serves to "minimize the impact" of this issue and "try to leverage economic cooperation between the two countries."
"An element that can help measure the pulse of the Portuguese Prime Minister's visit will be the signing of documents. Will be signed memorandum of understanding (which are generally not binding), or commercial agreements? Or only press notes? This will be the best barometer, beyond the words of circumstance that will naturally be delivered," he said.
Investments | Montenegro says Portugal is “reliable and confident”
Luís Montenegro said yesterday that during the official visit to China and then Japan, he wants to bring the message that Portugal “is a reliable and confident country” for economic investments.
According to the Prime Minister, the program “Gives the opportunity that the Portuguese Prime Minister has to talk and interact directly with the President of the National Assembly of the Popular Republic of China, with the President of the Republic, with the Prime Minister”.
"At the same time that the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Economy and the Minister of Environment and Energy interact bilaterally with their counterparts and also with entrepreneurs and Chinese companies that operate in Portugal and with Portuguese companies operating in China," he added.
For Montenegro, the fact that the visits are being made “with some compression in terms of durability” - four days divided between China and Japan - should be seen from another perspective.
"It is just the record that we are able to do all this simultaneously, we are able to leave here to Macau, we are able to go to Tokyo and to be able, in this geographical area, to bring the message that Portugal is a confident country, is a reliable country, it is a country where it is worth looking and that also looks to the world," he defended.
Montenegro also pointed out that Portugal is already “enjoying several investments that originate in China and have been levers for the transformation and economic development of Portugal”.
"It is our intention to contribute to our coming here so that we can also open doors to which more Portuguese companies can find in the Chinese market the destination of their products and, therefore, also increase our export share for this geography," he said.

Sam Hou Fai appealed to prevention and Tai Kin IP indicated that casinos will close this afternoon, when the sign 8. CNN was advanced yesterday that, so far, Ragasa is the strongest storm in the world
 
After playing on land yesterday on the island of Calyan in the Philippines, Super Typhoon Ragasa advanced through the Southern Sea of ​​China, following a trajectory that Macao authorities estimate to be able to pass on 100 kilometers from the territory. CNN indicated yesterday that so far this was the worst storm this year globally.
Here, the arrival of Super Typhoon led the authorities to gather yesterday at the Civil Protection Operations Center with the Chief Executive. Sam Hoi Fai highlighted the importance of preventive work, noting that, based on the analysis of China's interior authorities, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Ragasa may be the strongest storm to reach the Mangkhut, a possibility that has classified as "very high".
According to forecasts of the meteorological and geophysical services, Ragasa could pass less than 100 kilometers from Macao between dawn and Wednesday morning.  Sam Hou Fai understands that society and all government services have to be alert and should not just “have a mindset to count on good luck”. "It is very said that" Macao is a blessed land, "but this can result in negligence," he added.
The chief executive explained that Ragasa can cause “Storm appear” phenomena as happened with Mangkhut, giving rise to floods with a maximum of five meters high, at the first floor of the red market, for example.
"The impact may be significant. Preparation has been performed in advance and interdepartal communication, hoping that the losses can be reduced to a minimum possible, in order to ensure the safety and stability of the entire population. I am serious to which all traders, public and private institutions, and associations, do the work of preparation against catastrophe in advance," he warned.
Casinos can close
On the sidelines of the same meeting, the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP, said the casinos will close the doors if the storm signal 8, and that the authorities will transmit this scenario in advance to ensure the personal security of tourists and tourism sector staff.  Wong Sio Chak, Secretary for Security, said his tutelage met with companies and associations to coordinate streets cleaning efforts after Typhoon's passage. The secretary also appealed to evacuation, first of all, residents with older age.
In turn, the head of the Department of Family and Community Services of the Institute of Social Action, Law Lai Peng, pointed out that the body has prepared the launch of level 2 of the emergency evacuation and reception mechanism, and the 17 available emergency host centers could be open, capable of receiving 24,000 people.
Regarding the Macau Bridge, Raymond Tam, secretary for transport and public works, ensured that the infrastructure will be ended in traffic during the typhoon, although the previous results of tests to storm height have been positive.  The secretary justified the closing of the bridge saying that Ragasa is a “super typhoon” and that took into account the poor condition of infrastructure access.
Raymond Tam also mentioned that if floods are above one meter, it will consider the possibility of suspending the supply of electricity in the lower areas of the territory in order to accelerate the entire recovery process after the typhoon.
From 15h this afternoon and until tomorrow, between 250 and 280 flights to or departure from Macau International Airport will be canceled.  As for the return to class, the secretary for social and culture affairs, LAM, ensured that the government will analyze the situation based on official data on floods and heavy rains occurred after the typhoon, provided by weather and geophysical services.
The state of schools and roads will also be analyzed to decide that there are conditions for reopening. However, LAM indicated that schools have flexibility to address issues such as students' presence and testing.</description><pubDate>2025-09-23 03:12:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Government in “firm opposition” to Washington on investment environment</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/governo-em-firme-oposicao-a-washington-sobre-ambiente-de-investimento/</link><description>The Government of the MSAR expressed yesterday “strong displeasure and firm opposition” to the “annual report on the investment environment by 2025 country” published on Friday by the US Department of the United States of America.
Leaded Executive Sam Hou Fai states that the document "contains comments not supported by facts about Macao's economic and political development", "including unfounded allegations on the improvements introduced by MSAR in its electoral regime and the law on the defense of state security."
The Trump Administration Department led by Marco Rubio begins by indicating that, as regards the investment environment, the “Macao government maintains a transparent, non -discriminatory and free market economy”, and that the local executive “is committed to maintaining a favorable environment for investors”.
However, it adds that "foreign companies cite the constant shortages of qualified workers, the result of the dependence of the tourism city and gambling, as one of the main restrictions on its operations and future expansion." In this chapter, the State Department highlights the priority given to local workers, but criticizes some basic policies of MSAR.
In the document it is also highlighted that "the legal system of Macao is based on the rule of law and the independence of the judicial power" and that "foreign and national companies are registered under the same rules and are subject to the same set of commercial laws and bankruptcy."
However, the State Department states that the government's effort to achieve the aim of diversifying the game, dependent on the game, obtained minimal results. Also the bet on the role of Macao as a trade and services platform between China and Portuguese -speaking countries is referred to.
"China also advised Macao to become a 'commercial and business cooperation services platform' between mainland China and the Portuguese-speaking countries (PLP). Direct trade between Macau and the PLP is still marginal, representing only 0.9 percent of the total dollar $ 17.6 billion in 2024," was mentioned.
The executive led by Sam Hoi Fai responded by stating that the role of Macao "as a service platform for commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries is increasingly recognized everywhere."
The jewelry of the crown
Despite the US body's recognition of economic development, business environment, tax regime and investment incentive measures, the government considers that "achievements and progress" achieved by the MSAR "cannot be erased by such a report from the United States."
In the analysis of the State Department, criticism of the laws that regulate the elections of the head of the Executive and the deputies of the Legislative Assembly, as well as the legislation of safeguarding the state defense of the state.
In the first set of laws, the Government of the MSAR responded by alluding to the elections of September 14. The electorate fully exercised his democratic rights and enthusiastically participated in the vote. "The influx to the polls has reached a record with more than 175,000 voters, which represents a participation rate of 53.35 percent. This fully demonstrates that the electoral regime of the Revised Legislative Assembly gained the support and recognition of residents in general", was indicated in relation to the legal reform that established the recent principle "Macau ruled by patriots".
Regarding legislation to safeguard state security, the executive of Sam Hou Fai counter-attaca and states that "in fact," the United States has long promulgated a series of strict national security laws and often abuse their extraterritorial jurisdiction. "
"Instead of self-reflection, the US unilaterally criticizes others, demonstrating a double standard classic and hypocrisy. The United States are an important economic partner of MSAR. We hope that the American part will abstain from politicizing economic issues, cease political maneuvers and focus on actions that lead to the stable development of economic relations and bilateral commercial relations," said the executive of the executive of the executive, "said the executive Mand.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 04:55:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Cotai | Recovered land occupied illegally</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/cotai-recuperado-terreno-ocupado-ilegalmente/</link><description>The government recovered land next to the Macao East Asia Sports Ship that had been illegally occupied.

The series “Passion of Xi Jinping for Culture”, with ten episodes, each 28 minutes, will be broadcast on TDM and TV Cabo Macau SA, with later broadcasts on the multimedia platforms of Chinese newspapers or Mun (Macau Daily), Tai Chung Pou, Citizen Journal, Hou Kong Daily and Lotus Times.
In turn, the “presentation and interpretation of Xi Jinping's economic thinking”, with 14 episodes, had its first exhibition yesterday, and can be seen on TDM until November 9, both on television and on the website and mobile app.
The debut event of these productions took place yesterday at the Macao Forum Complex and had a speech by the chief executive. Sam Hou Fai said these documentaries serve "to encourage the involvement, understanding and implementation of Xi Jinping's thinking about socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era between compatriots in Macao and peoples around the world."
New agreement signed
In the same session, “five framework agreements” were signed between the Government and China Media Group, namely the “Framework Agreement to deepen the strategic cooperation between China Media Group and the Government of MSAR”, the “Framework Agreement on Cooperation in the Film Industry between China State Administration and the Secretariat for Social Affairs and Culture”. Also signed were the agreements “Letter of Intent for the cooperation between the organizing committee of the Macao Competition Zone of the 15th edition of the National Games and the 12th edition of the National Games for people with disabilities, as well as the 9th edition of the National Special Olympic Games and China Media Group”.
It is also included “agreement on the full transmission of the CCTV-5 sports channel between China Media Group and the TDM and the Strategic Partnership Commission between the Asia Pacific station of China Media Group and the University of Macao”.
Sam Hou Fai explained that the documentary “Passion of Xi Jinping for Culture” has content about “the essence of Xi Jinping's thinking about culture”, reporting “authentic stories of appreciation and commitment of Mr. Presidente XI to the transmission of cultural heritage and its development”.
The two documentaries compile, according to Sam Hou Fai's discourse, “the theoretical study” around the president's thinking, “helping the public understand” his teachings. Sam Hou Fai also said that these "are the first television documentaries to expose Xi Jinping's economic thinking, in which Mr. President's main speeches are meticulously analyzed and historical transformations and achievements achieved under his orientation in China's economic development during the New Age."</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 03:31:40</pubDate></item><item><title>FAOM | Deputies promise to fight for more work rights</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/26/faom-deputados-prometem-lutar-por-mais-direitos-laborais/</link><description>Ella Lei Cheng I and Leong Sun Iok intend to contribute to creating better employment conditions for young people and guaranteeing more rights for civil servants involved in the civil protection mechanism
 
After reelection, the deputy of the Macao Workers 'Federation of Workers (Faom), Ella Lei Cheng I and Leong Sun IOK, promise to focus the new term in labor issues and the development of workers' rights. The statements were made by the members of the Union for Development list during the participation in the Macao Forum of the Chinese channel of Radio Macau.
Ella Law stressed that employment is always the biggest concern of residents and that this will be their priority in the next four years, as a member of the Legislative Assembly. "Although the number shows that the unemployment rate is not high, the fact that residents have to accept jobs with lower career prospects and greater difficulties should not be hidden," the deputy acknowledged.
"For example, we have many complaints that young people, particularly the newcomers, have difficulty being hired. In addition, middle-aged or elderly people also face the same problem," he added. The deputy also confessed to being aware that it is increasingly difficult for residents to change their careers.
In turn, Leong Sun IOK argued that labor rights need to be improved, and gave as an example civil servants involved in civil protection operations. "During the passage of Typhoon Ragasa, the government generally did a good job to make the most of the impact of the typhoon," he began to highlight. "However, we receive complaints from civil protection workers, because when working during these hours they only receive supplementary compensation, but practically lost all other work rights, because they work extra hours and are not entitled to compensatory rest," he explained.
Casinos worry
In addition to civil protection workers and security forces, Leong Sun Iok argued that employees' safety in the hotel and game sector also needs to be rethought and increased.
At issue is the fact that these employees need to work during extreme meteorological conditions, regardless of often not even available public transport. For this reason, Leong Sun Iok has suggested to the government to follow the practices of the cities in the interior of China to establish a new mechanism for suspension of work and classes and also for the calculation of compensatory remuneration.
In addition to the focus on labor rights, Ella Law and Leong Sun IOK defended a new consumer card round, to relaunch the economy of residential neighborhoods and respond to the difficulty of the elderly in the use of new technologies, which makes them excluded from the great consumption award.
Ella Law also promised to pay attention to the indexation of pension to the elderly to the minimum subsistence index, as well as to the medical system, to reinforce the care services to chronic elderly diseases.</description><pubDate>2025-09-26 06:56:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Tui officially recognized the results</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/26/eleicoes-tui-reconheceu-oficialmente-os-resultados/</link><description>The last court announced yesterday that the results of the elections of direct suffrage and indirect suffrage were officially recognized on Tuesday.

However, in the next three years, the secretary will abdicate the monthly pension of 83,190 patacas. The decision will cost the secretary's pocket at least 2.91 million Patacas
 
The Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam, has been renovated since August 21, but has abdicated the monthly pension of 83,190 patacas. The announcement of the decision was published in the official bulletin on Wednesday, and Tam follows the example of Raimundo Rosario, his predecessor as secretary.
According to the current regime, Raymond Tam could accumulate the secretary's salary with the retired pension, which would give a monthly income around 270,499 Patacas. Currently, as secretary, TAM can earn 187,309 Patacas by the performance of the functions in the Government, of which 149,847 Patacas concern the base salary and 37,462 Patacas to representation expenses.
In this salary, and after a 30 -year career at the Institute for Municipal Affairs, Raymond Tam is entitled to award a pension of 83,190 patacas, which results from a monthly base pension of 77,550 patacas, plus six antiquity prizes, which translates into 5,640 patacas per month.
However, the secretary abdicates the pension for almost three years: "Tam Man filed a written statement on August 14, 2025, that he dispense with the perception of the retirement pension due to him and other subsidies with it as long as to hold the position of Secretary for Transport and Public Works," was reported.
Three -year limit
In the order it is also clarified that the withdrawal has the conditions “the maintenance of the right to perception of the retirement pension and other subsidies related to it from the date on which it fails to perform its current position” and that the withdrawal is no longer in force “the day before that in which the prescription referred to in Article 272 (2) of the ETAPM”.
According to this article, civil servants who have abdicated the pension for three consecutive years lose the right to receive it.
Calculating the number of pensions from September and in the next two years and 11 months, Tam will abdicate to receive about 2.91 million patacas. However, if you choose to receive the pension for a month and then abdicate the pension in the remaining term, the amount of pensions for receiving rises to about 3.25 million patacas. As by 2029 there may be increases for the civil service, the value that the ruler fails to receive can even be higher.
With this decision, Raymond Tam follows the example of Raimundo do Rosário who in August 2021 was forced to reform, as he reaches the limit age in the civil service. However, as he served as secretary, Macaense abdicated the pension, in a decision that implied the loss of income of approximately 3 million patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-09-26 06:48:10</pubDate></item><item><title>55</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/55/</link><description>The problem of housing in Portugal is one of the largest gaps in society. Much has been built, but have been luxury or real estate condominiums that only the upper or high average classes can acquire. The normal worker, who lives from a salary of approximately 1000 and 1500 euros, can never think of buying home. A young man, not even dreaming.
It is no coincidence that Portugal is the country of Europe where children are living more years in their parents' homes. Even the public or social dwellings that have been built in the last decade, some being part of buildings with fourteen floors, are completely abandoned. There are buildings in social neighborhoods with ten and more floors that have had damaged elevators for over two years for lack of maintenance and many seniors have not left home for over a thousand days.
In large cities we can observe thousands of houses that are closed. Some, by litigation between heirs. Others, simply because the owner has more than a property and does not want to sell or lease. The government should decree the prohibition of a home ended for more than three months. Only on an avenue of Lisbon we counted about 200 homes of blinds down and without living someone.
However, this chronicle is dedicated to Luís Montenegro who owns, imagine, of 55 houses. Consequently an inquiry in the Public Prosecution Service (MP) over the case. This, after the “scolding” we watched with his “familiar” company that received hundreds of thousands of euros from potential clients receiving award from the Montenegro government. According to a source of the MP, everything can happen to Montenegro. If serious irregularities and acts of corruption are proven, the Prime Minister will obviously have to resign. And in this case, an advisor to a government ministry, he said that Ministers Leitão Amaro and Paulo Rangel would be prepared to assume the position of Chief Executive.
55 houses belonging to Luís Montenegro is surprising and offensive to all Portuguese who cannot buy a house, who live in tents or who are homeless. The clarification has to be fully and the prime minister last week received from the MP a request for more documentation on the preventive investigation that takes place on its unlavod properties and the activity of its “family” spinumviva company.
The most shocking on the part of the politician who heads the Portuguese Government arrested with its ban on public access to the number of the matrix of the 55 properties that declared to the entity for transparency. Montenegro submitted to this organism an opposition request for the disclosure of the number of the headquarters of the buildings, and the entity concerned the request of the head of the Government.
The prime minister declared six urban properties, including the “famous” luxurious house of Espinho, which has five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and garage, an apartment in Lisbon, 46 rustic buildings, which he said he inherited from his family. Asked by journalists about the requested ban, the prime minister's office did not respond. What, and why, Montenegro hides what you have from real estate? Fearful that it is discovered that your acquisition was not lawful?
The Prime Minister, who holds so many properties, has to know what young people suffer who cannot have a housing or what the university students spend on organized mobster groups. A daughter of a friend of ours gave us that she lived in Lisbon in a room with another colleague and paid 600 euros a month. We didn't believe it and went to confirm.
- Good afternoon, my lady!
- Good afternoon…
- Do you have any room to lease?
- No, I don't have… well, I mean…
- I mean… how?
-If you are willing to pay a room where two people sleep, I arrange a…
- Like this? Do two people sleep in each room?
- Yes!
- And are they friends?
- Many times, no!
– E quantos quartos tem?
- I have seven, with three bathrooms…
- I mean, there are seven rooms, each with two people and not everyone has a private bathroom…
- No…
- And who lives in the rooms?
- They are university students… boys and girls…
- And how much does each one pay?
- The monthly price is 600 euros…
- Sorry, 600 euros for the bedroom, 300 each, is that it?
- No no! Each one, pays 600 euros and if you want a room you have to pay 1200 euros…
-Sorry, but I don't see the movie well… you have seven bedrooms, each yields you a month 1200 euros, which makes a monthly total of 8,400 euros… and passes receipt?
- Don't even think!
"So you get 8,400 euros a month and still escape the tax authorities?"
- Sorry, I'm going to close the door because I don't know who you are, with so many questions… this is not pleasing me… What does you do?
- I'm a journalist ...
- Pum !!!

Albert Einstein
This is what seems to be happening today with us, Europeans anesthetized by eighty years without war. We wonder if they will not be too much. If the privilege we enjoy, like no previous generation, is about to expire. Should expire. When in doubt, we resorted to weapons. Rearmament for fear. A sinister ribombar in European chancels tired of peace. How to be at war without yet being there. It risks exploding us in the hands because we don't know what it is. Because we prefer not to know.
History teaches that peace and war have always been pursued cyclically. But the duration of cycles only discover it a posteriori, each from its own perspective, inscribed in the common sense of the collectivity to which it belongs. The only certainty is that peace and war are not eternal. We read the years in the rings that are recorded in the bark of the trees. Thick concentric circles follow themselves to the thin.
The former indicate favorable climate, the others, severe. The highest tree in the world of 115 meters and 66 centimeters is a Sequoia Sempervirens called Hyperion, hidden somewhere in the Redwood National Park, California. To avoid gathering of curious, aspiring idolaters or rain dancers, the geographical coordinates of this totem are kept secret.
We can only imagine the traces that the giant's skin is receiving from Californian times never so dry. In just two generations, the paradise of hippies, visionaries some transformed into apocalyptic technological vassals gathered by the revolving door of King Trump, a self-proclaimed archangel of universal peace becoming hell. What remains of the harmony of "California Dreamin", success "The Mamas &amp; The Popes", which in 1965 put the current octogenarians dancing at a syncopated rhythm?
The same ones that four years later would chant “Give Peace a Chance”, John Lennon's Cantilena seller? Now that, from Californian peak, the American dream adopted by Europe Felix as a paradigm of peace, progress and prosperity plunges into depression, we have to admit that this good itself, introjected as eternal thanks to the defeat that, as western Europeans "winning" and overcome from America, is today an inert brand. Survive, badly, to oneself. For Trump, we are not worth the bones of a Marine.
Peace inherited from the New World expired as a non -renewable contract by the landlord. We have to regain it. And, however, adapt to us to live dangerously. The British Patriarch of Science Fiction, H.G. Wells, launched in 1914 the crusade against Germans with the cry of "war to end all wars." Today, a similar endeavor may lead to simultaneous extinction of peace and war, through an atomic holocaust encouraged by some semiautomatic algorithm. But there are wars that do not announce themselves with Clarins nor are they locking in open fields. They are underground wars of cartels and cryptocurrencies, non -uniform general generals and sovereignty states. It is on this threshold that is drawn, with less and less diffuse strokes, the spectrum of a confrontation between the United States and Venezuela. Not a conventional war, but a collision between a tired empire and a narcophilic state, where power is confused with trafficking and sovereignty with the smuggling.
Venezuela, once Bolivarian headlight, has become an authoritarian survival laboratory, supported by illicit networks that cross continents. The so -called “Los Soles Cartel”, alleged drug trafficking structure, embedded in the Venezuelan Armed Forces is not just a metaphor of institutional corruption but the state skeleton. A state that, losing a monopoly on legitimate violence, outsides war on its margins, turning generals into drug barons and borders into cocaine corridors.
Washington notes, restless. The Justice Department accused Venezuelan tall figures for narcoterrorism. Sanctions multiply in spiral, as if they were diplomatic bullets. But what is imposed now is more than containment but the possibility of an intervention. Not for democracy, but for hemispheric security. Not for freedom, but for the stability of the market. Monroe doctrine is reborn, disguised as a drug war, while drones fly over orinoco and aircraft carrier approach the cariban.
The war, if it comes, will be hybrid. Made of sabotage, cybership, covered operations and misinformation campaigns. A war that does not declare, but is executed. That is not overcome but perpetuates itself. And that, like all modern wars, runs the risk of becoming an end in itself and a shadow theater where peace is only the interval between two operations. In this scenario, Europe, still numbed from its long truce, assists as a privileged and powerless spectator. The war is again a possible horizon, not by choice, but by contagion. And perhaps, as in the Hyperion rings, this dry and seizure weather is recording on our skin the beginning of a new cycle in which peace, like the American dream, is not an acquired data, but an achievement to be reinvented.
The dirty peace of which one does not speak is the opposite of just peace, on which the official rhetoric and their unofficial megaphons dissect without ever explaining what it consists of. It seems to evoke the reaffirmation of the triumphant West, of NATO Variable Geometry plus Japan, South Korea, Australia and the like against China, Russia, Iran and North Korea (Saudi Arabia and other gulf petrodes, they will be with us). Light peace, lesbian love in ideal-like baroque iconography that illustrates Psalm 85: 10-11, would presuppose a “third”, referee of the world.
A God recognized by humanity, solicitous to calibrate the righteous weights in the universal scale. We are, however, in the triumph of the principle of unreality, to which Europeist paradoxes are sacrificed without Europe. The manipulation of consensus dominates the search for meaning. Just peace is an oximoro. If it is peace, it cannot be fair saved in the sense of the winner, which is because the defeated accepts the end of hostilities to mitigate the consequences. History is always in motion, between conflicts and respite. No one imposes themselves without others reacting or retreating without their advances. Wars and peace describe a continuum where actors carry with them the entire line of their life, which crosses and collides with others. Not always with weapons. Sanctions and counterattacks, cyber attacks and mass brain wash over time produce effects as lethal as fire mouths.
The endless search for just peace means permanent war. Without any purpose other than herself. Evil in itself, there is always too much. Without peace ie, without respite there is no justice. While fighting, the strength is in force. To mitigate it, commitments are required. Uncertain, ambiguous, even repulsive. But still life. Improved, unlike death. In a pregnant world of apocalypse, the alternative to war is dirty peace. In double sense, adjectival and verbal. The adjective indicates the silence of weapons on the brink of total destruction, structured in a competition between actors willing to sacrifice “unnataged” principles to avoid total war. The verb reminds us that peace requires maintenance. You need to get your hands dirty. Choose between smaller ills. Lubricate the frictions between opposite interests and impulses. We leave the very concrete hypothesis that also the fourth Rome, like the previous three, will not end in peace. This applies to the fero American who sees the decline of the imperial nation as inevitable, but prefers to die, if it has to be.
And it also applies to whom, like Trump, he swears to restore the greatness of the homeland and to guarantee the world a second Augusta dividing the planet in understanding with China, too large and intrinsic to America to be destroyed without draging the triumphant into the abyss. With the western hemisphere entrusted to the United States and the Eastern China, plus their clients. The hypothesis can fascinate some. It is important to trace a route that avoid the fusion of war fragments in one, total and final. An imperfect, provisional, “impure”, “non -quiet” peace, in the elegant definition that gave him Emmanuel Macron three years ago. Yes, he himself, today committed to the Military Challenge holder to Russia in support of the invaded Ukraine. Sometimes the bluffs come true. In general, the map where the ways for dirty peace is looking for and drawing archipelagos of dirty truce we observe that the outbreaks of war are concentrated in the southern East Hemisphere, especially between Africa and Middle East with the decisive exception of Ukraine. Therefore, in the future sphere of Chinese influence according to Trump.

On August 26, the media announced that a Californian couple had sued the technology company OpenAi and its executive director Sam Altman, claiming that Chatbot, ChatgPT, had encouraged his 16-year-old son Ryan to commit suicide.
The story began when Ryan asked Chatgpt because he felt unhappy. Then I wanted to know what resistance a rope had to be used in a hanging and the chatgpt answered, "I understand what you want to say and I won't escape the question. You want to die because you are tired of trying to survive in this insensitive world."
An OpenAi spokesman spoke later, expressing his grief for the death of the young man and the family's mourning and said they would immediately update security measures and improve AI models intended for young users.
Although the case is not complex, the legal, ethical and technological issues that arouse deserve a deepened reflection by all sectors of society.
Ryan's lawsuit against OpenAi and Altman is a civil process and not a crime process.
If ChatgPT really provided Ryan information about how he committed suicide and encouraged him to commit the act, why did the California government have not moved a crime process? The reason is simple. First, it is not yet clear that these allegations are true. Second, AI is recent technology and its impact on society cannot yet be totally predictable. In fact, problems often arise before legal regulation is implemented. These two factors are combined to delay the legal action. In other words, if the incentive to suicide is a crime, then it must be convicted by the law. However, there is currently no law that provides for the possibility of this incentive from artificial intelligence platforms. Under the “Nullum Crimn Sine Lege,“ (there is no crime without law) how can this issue be dealt with in court?
The situation is similar to civil processes. Because there are no laws that regulate civil liability and compensation in cases of AI -induced suicide, Ryan's parents could only claim that the incident had been "the predictable consequence of a well -thoughtful program" and that Ryan's death had been caused by "malicious AI action or by unforeseen extreme circumstances." Therefore, they requested an unspecified financial compensation.
This type of civil process is an action of “responsibility for the product”. Simply put, if a product has a defect that harms the user, the manufacturer is required to compensate it. A precedent is the 1932 Owner V Stevenson case. The complainant dinner with friends in a restaurant and ordered a can of ginger beer. After drunk, they discovered a dead caracol inside the can. The complainant was hospitalized due to shock. After recovering, he prepared to sue the restaurant, but came across a problem: his friend had paid the meal and he had no contractual relationship with the establishment. The beer was intact when it was handed over and so could not advance with the process. Finally, the complainant eventually sued the beer manufacturer and won the strife. This was the first precedent in consumed law on liability for defective products. In the United States, consumed law is in force and this precedent remains valid today.
With regard to ethics, shortly after Ryan's case, Altman stated at a meeting that OpenAi was trying to find ways to notify competent government agencies if a minor was seriously discussing suicide -related chatgPT and the company could not contact the parents of the minor. However, this method should not advance because it goes against the user's privacy protection policy. He also stated that ChatgPT should not support or contest anything, which means he should not take a position.
From a technological point of view, AI, abbreviation for artificial intelligence, is actually an exchange of messages between computers and users. These messages are generated through complex statistical models and use a language similar to human language, but to which lack of emotion. In addition, AI's current technology is unable to understand the complexities of human thought. For example, if one person tells another, “the next time we meet, we have a tea,” AI just interprets as “at some point in the future, two people will have tea.” However, if these words are just an act of courtesy, and in fact the one who wrote them has no intention of reviewing the other, there is a psychological complexity that is out of the reach of understanding AI technology. With the rapid technological advances, the AI ​​of the future will undoubtedly be able to understand the multiple meanings of the phrase "the next time we meet, we had a tea." However, if the Age of our day cannot understand the whole meaning of this sentence, how should users interpret their answers?
Next week we will continue to analyze this subject.

In the legislative elections held in Macau on the 14th, and to the very surprise of the overwhelming majority of people, he won the list 2 - Nova Esperança, headed by Portuguese deputy José Pereira Coutinho, probably due to the insistent appeal - to say - to the exercise of the vote by civil servants, which was made by the administration of the masters and the members of his government, which has originated the tendency of those workers in depositing their electoral confidence Of the respective class, and also eventually, due to the fact that the former Deputy Ron Lam's list was excluded from this electoral scrutiny, and could have recorded a vote transfer to list 2, with which some project affinities, parliamentary practice and social objectives were recorded, and also certainly due to the work developed by José Pereira from the many years that leads from Macao and by Macao and by Positive, constant and dynamic activity of those responsible for the Macao Public Function Association, that the deputy is president of the respective board.
But what will also have caused great amazement or admiration in the most attentive people, and with some legitimacy for those who do not know the intricacies of the Electoral System of the Legislatives in Macao, is the fact of list 2 - New Hope had 43,361 votes, which corresponded to the attribution of 3 elected deputies, and the list in second place, list 1 - Association of United Citizens of Macao, also benefited from Macao Election of 3 deputies, but with a total of only 29,459 votes.
In fact, people have the idea that the Macao electoral system, in the image of what happens in Portugal, is a proportional representation system, which means that the number of elected by each candidacy competing for an election is necessarily proportional to the number of votes, or voters, who chose to vote for this application.
And this would not have happened in the legislative elections of Macao, as did not actually happen, because assigning 3 elected to 43,361 votes, and the same 3 elected but to 29,459 votes, is not at all proportional. But there are legal grounds for the assignment of deputies to have been established and made correctly, regardless of trying to understand the reasons why this happened.
The proportional representation system in force in Macau uses the Hondt method for converting votes into mandates, in the image of what happens in Portugal, but it is a changed Hondt method, as it will try to explain to explain.
Hondt's method is a mathematical model used to convert votes into mandates with a view to the composition of high school organs, which was created by Belgian lawyer Victor D'Hondt (1841-1901), and in its simplest model in Portugal, that method applies through the successive division of the total number of votes obtained by each application by previously fixed dividers, and in the case 1, 2, 2, 2 3, 4, 5, etc., and for the attribution of the mandates in dispute in order to decrease the highest quotients resulting from the divisions operated, and the division process continues until they are exhausted and finding all the mandates and all the possibilities of appearing equal quotients to which a mandate still fits, and then vows that do not serve any mandate.
In Portugal, a correction to the said method of pure Hondt is still legally foreseen, but little interest to deepen here, being irrelevant from the prospect of trying to understand the existing electoral system in Macao.
The legal headquarters that establishes the regime to convert the votes into mandates in Macao, in relation to the elections to the Legislative Assembly of the MSAR, is article 17 of Law No. 3/2001, of March 5, a legal diploma that has undergone some legislative amendments over the years, enshrining a method of changed the votes to the vote in few places in the world, Which, in practice, makes it very difficult to election more than two deputies per candidacy, and makes it virtually impossible for the election of four deputies of a single list of candidates, thus trying to avoid the exaggerated preponduction of candidacies sponsored by important or powerful associations.
The conversion of the votes to mandates is made in accordance with the number of votes obtained by each application, being the vote in each of the several lists successively divided by 1, 2, 4, 8 and other powers of 2, to the number of terms to be distributed (14), being the quotients aligned in descending order, in a series of as many terms, and, being in question the fourteen election, the fourteen deputies, Divisors were established by 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28, with the mandates to be attributed to the lists that get the highest quotients.
With this Hondt method changed, and as said above, applications with not very significant votes are privileged, compared to those that concentrate a high number of votes, deliberately increasing the cost of votes for the election of more than two deputies, when compared to what necessary for the election of the first two.
While, by the pure Hondt method, the election of an additional deputy always has a similar cost, at number of votes, necessary to elect the first deputy (if, for example, 10,000 votes allow you to elect a deputy, 20,000 should allow two, 30,000 votes for four, 50,000 votes five, and so on), with this method in Macao, the election of the first two deputies was not changed, but from the first two deputies. It has now been increased (10,000 votes one deputy, 20,000 votes two deputies, 40,000 votes three deputies, 80,000 votes four deputies, 100,000 votes five deputies, etc.).
For example, the election of four deputies, from the same list, has the same cost in votes as the election of eight deputies, in eight different lists, or than that of eight deputies, in four different lists, electing each list two deputies.
See the case of the 2017 legislative elections, in which the field of so-called pro-democrats was divided into three lists, having Sulu Sou, who led the list of the new Macao Association, then the largest pro-democracy association in the city, was elected, as well as veterans NG Kuok Cheong and Au Kam San, who headed two other distinct candidatures, outside the Macao Association, thus allowing the founded association Election of three deputies in different lists, which would not be possible if they all were part of the same list.
Heading the three such lists, Au Kam San got 11,381 votes, NG Kuok Cheong had 10,080 and Sulu I am got 9,213, and were elected, and the sum of the votes of the three candidates in one list would never give way to the election of three deputies, but only two.
This strategy had to do with the division between the traditional and liberal wings of the pro-democracy movement, but it also pursued the aim of increasing the likelihood of gaining more parliamentary seats, as happened.
I do not know all the historical reasons for the changes to the traditional Pure Hondt method, which were introduced in Macao in 1991, but I think that it had already had to do with the growth of the democratic sector in the Macao society, which even defeated in legislative elections the traditional sector led by Dr. Carlos d'AsuSumpção.</description><pubDate>2025-09-23 04:05:17</pubDate></item><item><title>China Cultural Week | Crafts at the fishermen's dock</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/semana-cultural-da-china-artesanato-na-doca-dos-pescadores/</link><description>Doca dos Fishermen receives, until November, the Craft Fair integrated in the 17th Cultural Week of China and Portuguese -speaking countries, which opened doors this Saturday.

Now, with a new singer, the Black Eyed Peas debut in Macao on November 21, at Macao's outdoor shows in Cotai. Tickets are already on sale
 
The concert zone at Cotai, with the official local name of outdoor shows, will receive in November a concert that promises to fill the measurements of the public: Americans Black Eyed Peas (BEP). Formed in 1992, the band began to be known with the third studio album, "Elephunk", released in 2003, from where the success that still plays on the radios: "Where Is the Love?", In partnership with singer Justin Timberlake.
On November 21, BEPs act in Macao, but already with some changes in the original formation of the group, as Fergie left in 2018, betting on a solo career. His place was occupied by singer J. Rey Soul. Tickets for the Macao show are already on sale and range from 699 to $ 1.699 Hong Kong on the Uutix platform. The bep also acts in neighboring Hong Kong on November 19 at the West Kowloon Cultural District.
If in the late 1990s the bep were a trio bet on doing alternative hip hop, when they signed with Interscope Records, they began to bet on more pop beats. With this publisher they released the albums "Behind the Front" in 1998, and then "Bridging the Gap" in 2000.
In the third album everything exploded and the bep managed to achieve true commercial success. “Where is the Love?”, A song that questions the course of the world and the values ​​of humanity, rising at the top of sales in several countries, reaching position 14 at Billboard 200 and sold in the UK alone, 1.6 million copies. Worldwide sold 8.5 million.
With “Elephunk” the bep did not leave the grid of MTV and Fergie was gaining notoriety in the middle of the group. Other successes came out, such as "Shut Up", "Hey Mama" and "Let's Get It Started". Taking advantage of the wave of success, “Monkey Business”, out of 2005, also generated more songs than BEP fans don't forget, such as “Pump It”, a pure pop song that fills any disco track, “Don't Phunk With My Heart” or “My Humps”.
The huge success of the hit "I Gotta Feeling" can not yet ignore, out of a later album, the 2009 "The E.N.D.", which also had the successful single "Boom Boom Pow". With “I Gotta Feeling”, the bep also left their mark on the radio and dance tracks around this world to this day.
Solo works
In the midst of the success of the bep, Fergie took the opportunity to do some solo work that also had notoriety. In 2006, “The Dutchess” came out, which sold 12 million copies around the world and brought five singles to the musical tables, namely “London Bridge”, “Glamorous”, “Big Girls Don't Cry”, the latter more to pull for ballad. Producing more albums in the following years, and betting on her personal life, when she marries and having children, Fergie ended up leaving the bep in 2018.
However, also other members of the bep were making their songs, as was the case of Will.I.am, who made "#Willpower". Ten years ago the bep made a new song with DJ David Guetta, and preparing new discographic material.
The most recent bep album is "Elevation", was released in 2022, and has songs such as "Simply the Best", "Muevelo", "Audios" and "Double D'1", a total of 15 tracks more marked by Latin sounds. In 2020, in full pandemic, “Translation” came out.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 04:02:39</pubDate></item><item><title>East Foundation presents, in Lisbon, week dedicated to Korea</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/26/fundacao-oriente-apresenta-em-lisboa-semana-dedicada-a-coreia/</link><description>Between October 3rd and 10th, the Oriente Foundation hosts at the East Museum in Lisbon the “Celebrate A Korea” Cultural Program, which presents activities related to the elements of Korean culture, such as “K-Beauty”, music or gastronomy, with popular Kimchi.

A woman and five-year-old son remain in the intensive care of a Hong Kong hospital after Tuesday were taken by waves in Chai Wan, a riverside area in the city.
"When a disaster happens, such as tuffons or tsunamis, if people are alerted, the hypothesis of injuries is very reduced or minimal," said Faith Chan Ka Shun. "Unless we are talking about crazy people, who will still surf or for the beach to take a look, there are a risk," added the professor at the University of Nottingham Ningbo.
Yau Yung, a professor at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, argued that it is necessary to "educate people to really be aware and deal with these extreme climate."
"I would say that, at the current moment, the formation of the population is not enough, in Hong Kong and also in Macao," lamented the urban planning expert, who pointed to Japan as a good reference.
Japan is located in the fire ring, one of the most active seismic zones in the world, and suffers frequency tremors, so infrastructures in the country have been specially designed to resist on these occasions.
In addition, it stressed Yau, public schools in Japan include, since primary education, education on "importance and how they should respond to this type of emergency situations."
Start at school
In addition, defended the sustainability expert, betting on children's education can generate "a kind of virtuous cycle," because they "can actually teach adults." In Macao, videos of people were shared on social networks on flooded streets, fish that had escaped nurseries and aquariums in stores and restaurants, at a time when the maximum warning of typhoon was still in force.
"Of course it is possible to laugh at the situation and say that it really depends on people, if they want to die to be able to see the waves climbing," admitted Faith Chan, an academic born in Hong Kong. But the Professor of Environmental Sciences recalled that dangerous behaviors during the passage of typhoons may also lead to the death of firefighters or police officers, if a rescue operation is required.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 03:58:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Tuffons | Experts warn you to reinforce preparation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/tufoes-especialistas-avisam-para-necessidade-de-reforcar-preparacao/</link><description>Several academics point out that the fact that there was no dead during the passage of the Ragasa Super Typhoon was due to civil protection mechanisms, implemented after the great typhoons of 2017 and 2018
 
After Super Typhoon Ragasa, the most powerful storm registered on the planet in 2025, experts told Lusa that Macau and Hong Kong have to learn to live in a world of constant flooding and extreme climate. Ragasa forced the two Chinese Special Administrative Regions to maintain the maximum tuft alert - Level 10 - for more than ten hours, a new historical record.
Authorities had warned that this super typhoon could bring comparable conditions to Mangkhut, which in September 2018 caused estimated damage to Hong's $ 4.6 billion in the former British colony, and to the hat, considered the worst typhoon in over 50 years to reach Macau, which in 2017 caused ten dead and 240 injured in the territory.
The impact of Ragasa was much lower. In Hong Kong, there were about 100 people injured, 1,220 fallen trees and more than a thousand canceled flights. In Macao, the floods reached 1.51 meters, but only seven injured were recorded. Yau Yung, professor at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, argues that it was not luck, but “structural adaptation”. Faith Chan Ka Shun, a professor at the University of Nottingham Ningbo, says the absence of deaths was “a victory”, which is due to improvements in the alert system and the preparation of civil protection.
"This time they prepared very early, more than 12 hours [before Ragasa's passage]. People could decide to lose money because they stopped work, schools and everything else," said the Hong Kong-born academic.
Casinos Losses
In Macau the authorities ended the casinos for 33 hours. Operators will have lost 880 million patacas in revenues, almost 5 percent from September, estimated Jeffrey Kiang, analyst at CLSA consultant, quoted by the Ggraia news portal.
Even before Ragasa's passage, Macao's government leader already showed optimism, pointing to the implementation of evacuation plans for the low areas and the annual exercise of exercise.
Sam Hou Fai also underlined the entry into operation of rainwater lifting stations and sewage projects, which “significantly improved” the ability to drain and flood prevention. Yau Yung admitted that it would be possible to "really project a city to make it the flood test," building "large-scale infrastructures," like the rails that protect the Italian city of Venice.
But with much of Macau practically at sea level, a large -scale system “may not be effective or economically viable,” warned the urban planning expert.
Enjoy the sea
On the other hand, it stressed Faith Chan, would make it harder for the population to enjoy the sea, part of the history and culture of both cities.
The Professor of Environmental Sciences recalled that there are areas of Macau and Hong Kong where floods are chronic during the rainy season between May and September, even without typhoons.
Therefore, Chan argued that it makes more sense to build infrastructures to mitigate the impact of floods, namely underground tanks to store rainwater. The sustainable flood management expert has given the example of the Netherlands, where parking parks are designed with space to divert rainwater.
Yau Yung argued that including rainwater tanks should be “a mandatory requirement” for any building to be built in Macau and Hong Kong. "Of course it would cost some money, but in fact, the benefits can compensate for the investment in the medium term. I would say it's a good deal," added the expert in inclusive cities.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 03:54:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Traffic | Accident causes six injuries on the Friendship Bridge</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/transito-acidente-provoca-seis-feridos-na-ponte-da-amizade/</link><description>An accident on Saturday involving four vehicles on the Friendship Bridge, which circulated towards Taipa-Macau, resulted in six minor injuries.

However, the price of incomes and mortgages are also rising
 
Inflation accelerated in August to the highest level since January, it was announced Friday, in a month when the consumer price rate fell in the interior of China.
The index rose 0.27 percent in August, in homologous terms, more than double the amount recorded in July (0.11 percent), and the highest value since January (0.57 percent), according to official data. According to the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC), the acceleration of inflation was mainly due to food products and non-alcoholic beverages (plus 0.44 percent). The cost of meals acquired outside the home rose 1.54 percent.
Expenditure on lace or apartment mortgages rose 0.84 percent and 0.56 percent, respectively, even before the Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM) approved, on 18 September, the first decrease in the interest rate since the end of 2024. The Legislative Assembly of the Territory approved, in April 2024, the end of several taxes on the acquisition of housing, to “increase liquidity” Real estate market, at the time defended the Secretary for Economics and Finance, Law Wai Nong.
Recovering
With the recovery of the number of visitors, the region registered a 19.1 percent increase in the price of jewelery, goldsmiths and watches, popular products among tourists in the interior of China. In the opposite direction, the cost of excursions and hotels for travels abroad of Macao residents increased by 8.29 percent, while spending on education and insurance rose 1.27 percent and 1.34 percent, respectively.
In the interior of China, by far the largest commercial partner in Macau, the IPC returned to fall 0.4 percent in August, in homologous terms, the fifth month of deflation in the last half year. Deflation reflects weakness in domestic consumption and investment and is particularly severe, as a drop in the price of assets, as a rule contracted with credit, generates an imbalance between the value of loans and bank guarantees.
The data surprised the analysts, who provided for a 0.2 percent price contraction, after the rate was unchanged in July, ending four consecutive months of falling. The price index in the producer, which measures the prices to exit the factory, fell 2.9 percent in August, noting the 35th consecutive month of contraction, despite representing an improvement against the decrease of 3.6 percent recorded in July. In the neighboring Hong Kong region, inflation rose slightly from 1 percent in July to 1.1 percent in August.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 03:49:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Golden Week | Announced new pedestrian zones</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/semana-dourada-anunciadas-novas-zonas-pedonais/</link><description>The government announced the creation of two new temporary pedestrian zones in the old neighborhood of Taipa and in Nossa Senhora do Amparo Street, October 1 and 7.

The historical data was released by the Directorate of Meteorological and Geophysical Services (DSMG), in the Super Typhoon Balance of the Passage that caused eight injuries.
"Ragasa approached the region as a level of super typhoon, establishing several records, including breaking the record since 1968 by being the first time DSMG issued signal 10 twice the same year," was released by the authorities.
According to DSMG, this was also the first time that signal number 10 of Typhoon was lifted for “such a long period” for 10 hours and 30 minutes. However, the official information was no use what the previous record was.
The passage of the super typhoon is also marked by the fact that the number 10 of typhoon was lifted when the center of the typhoon was still 90 kilometers from Macao. According to the authorities, no sign 10 had never been lifted with the typhoon so long distance.
Since the beginning of the year this was the 11th tropical storm to affect Macau, the second highest number since there are records.
In addition to signal 10, signal 8, which was first raised on Tuesday at 5 pm, extended for 15 hours.
Strong winds
Regarding the maximum velocity of 10 -minute sustained winds, the authorities pointed out that they have reached “force 12”, which means they are winds classified as a hurricane. The strongest sustained winds were felt in the mud, next to the Noble Governor of Carvalho, Pac On, the Macau Bridge and the Sai Van Bridge.
In terms of gusts, the winds reached the level of “force 14”, which means they are classified as a hurricane. This type of gusts were also felt in the mud and along the coast between Macau and the mud. Also in the campus zone of the University of Macao, on Mountain Island, there were gusts of hurricane level. However, inside the peninsula and in Coloane, the winds were slightly weaker, with the classification vary between “very strong” and “violent thunderstorms” gusts.
At the same time, the highest floods were recorded in the inner port, where they reached 1.51 meters in some areas. In the north of the inner point the floods were 1.45 meters, while in the southernmost part the maximum recorded was 1.33 meters. In the pagoda do bazaar, the floods reached 1.24 meters, 1.14 meters in Ponte and Horta Square and 1.11 meters in the church of St. Francis Xavier.</description><pubDate>2025-09-26 07:04:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification as to their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstandings, if they are fortunately fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered a war, the best animals will be beheaded. superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

The storm forced to move more than 350,000 people in the archipelago, days after the passage of the Ragasa superrtup.
A spokesman for the Civil Defense Office, Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro, indicated in a video statement to know ten deaths, three recorded in the Eastern Province of Master, due to the collapse of trees and houses, and the remaining in the center of the Philippines.
Fourteen people are still missing in the center of the Philippines, the authorities reported without further details. More than 200,000 people from locations in the storm's trajectory were welcomed in centers for this purpose. Known in the archipelago as Opong, the typhoon also forced evacuating 351,840 people, according to data from the Catastrophs Management Council (NDRRMC), and to decree the closure of government offices and schools.
The typhoon hit the province of Eastern Samar on Thursday night, accompanied by winds of up to 165 kilometers per hour, according to the Filipine Meteorological Agency (Pagasa), before crossing the Bicol region and the Western Island of Mindoro, losing strength as he advanced.
Bualoi has gaining strength again after entering the sea of ​​southern China, said Pagasa. The typhoon went to Vietname, where, according to the meteorological agency, could reach land between Sunday night and today

Our bread
The typhoon hit the archipelago after Super Typhoon Ragasa hit the north of the country last Monday, causing at least a dozen dead and 17 injured among thousands of displaced people.
Tuphins are recurring phenomena in Southeast Asia, when the hot waters of the Pacific Ocean favor the formation of cyclones, and countries like Philippines are reached every year by about twenty of these tropical storms, especially at the rainy season, which usually begins in June and ends in November or December.
According to scientists, climate change is causing more frequent and intense extreme weather phenomena around the world. The archipelago is going through a moment of popular indignation for corruption in flood control millionaire projects, designed to protect citizens from the effects of tuffles and floods and allegedly completed, but in reality nonexistent or of poor quality.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 04:47:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Gansu | Magnitude 5.6 earthquake leaves material damage</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/gansu-sismo-de-magnitude-56-deixa-danos-materiais/</link><description>A magnitude 5.6 earthquake hit the Chinese province of Gansu (northwest) on Saturday morning, without causing victims, but causing material damage to homes, said the center of seismological networks in China.
The tremor was recorded at 05:49, local time (4:49 am in Macao), with epicenter ten kilometers deep, and was felt hard in several counties from the cities of Dinxi and Tianshui, according to the official Xinhua agency. In Longxi Rural County, damage was recorded at various dwellings, according to residents' testimonies, although authorities are still collecting information to evaluate the damage.
Local teams and rescue vehicles have been sent to the earthquake zone, to which the Emergency Ministry of Emergency Management will be joined. West China (where the autonomous regions of Tibet and Xinjiang and provinces such as Gansu or Qinghai) often suffer from earthquakes, due to proximity to the place where the tectonic plates of Asia and India meet in Himalayas. Generally, these events do not cause large numbers of human victims, since much of the region is uninhabited.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 04:43:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Environment | China wages constant struggle against desertification at the gobi gates</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/ambiente-china-trava-luta-constante-contra-desertificacao-as-portas-do-gobi/</link><description>On the banks of the Gobi Desert, northwest China, vineyards, straw grilles, and intelligent irrigation systems illustrate the constant struggle to wage desertification and create subsistence means on yards arid
 
"It is unrealistic to think that we can eliminate the deserts. The fight is constant to ensure that they do not cause damage to populations," Lusa Wang Xiaolin, head of the National Baitan Nature Reserve, in the Chinese province of Ningxia, turned over 70 years by three generations of workers dedicated to combating desertification in one of the planet's most extensive arid areas.
With about 1.3 million square kilometers, the Gobi Desert is the largest in Asia and the fourth largest in the world, extending from southern Mongolia to the northwest of China, along the provinces of Gansu, Ningxia and Mongolia.
With more than 46,000 hectares of desert treated and the advance of the dunes retreated more than 20 kilometers, the Baitan reserve is today a model of ecological reforestation. Drought and cold-resistant plants, such as desert jujuba, saxaul (haloxylon ammodendron) or pastered grass (Miscanthus), which grows only one meter above the ground but with roots that extend up to seven meters, allow survival without irrigation, only with rain, Wang explained.
"The Baitan reserve, which was 90 percent desert, was almost fully recovered. Of the 987 square kilometers of land, almost the entire desert was treated. There are only about 13 square kilometers left as a demonstration and investigation zone," he said.
The straw grilles technique to fix the sand, introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, allowed to dramatically increase the survival rate of planted species. More recently, the “1+4 ″ desertification control method, based on accuracy data, has been developed.
Zhang Xueyun, a peasant that has been working on desert's recovery for over three decades, recalls when "there were no roads, neither electricity, nor water." "Everything was hand -loaded," he explained. "Over time, we mechanized part of the process and recovered hundreds of hectares a year," he said.
The effect is double: fewer sand storms - a phenomenon that reaches northern China every year, destroying harvests and covering cities of dust - and more vegetation, which has contributed to increasing precipitation.
Savior cups
Also viticulture plays an important role. Christelle Chene, Xige brand ambassador, one of the region's largest wineries, she underlined Lusa the environmental and social impact of the sector: "The vineyards help to fix the sand, reduce sand storms and create jobs in the region."
Plantation density is low and almost all work is manual. "There is no one in the world to vindicate 2,000 hectares by hand. But because of the way we treat the vineyard, it is impossible to use machines," he said. The winery employs 1,500 full -time workers and benefits from a government -facilitated lease system. “Wine brought jobs and created communities,” he said. "Before, there was nothing here. Only Arid Land."
To protect the vines from the extreme cold, the drought and the strong winds, they are cultivated horizontally and are then buried during the winter. Watering is made with Gota-a-Gota systems initially imported from Israel, now replicated by Chinese companies, controlled by digital platforms that integrate meteorological data, soil moisture and water needs.
"We use the yellow river water, but rigorously," he noted to Lusa Lu Chao, director of the Ningxia Water Conservation Museum. "There is little rain and great evaporation, so each drop counts," he said.
According to the official, the region irrigated with river water grew from less than 1,330 km² before 1949 to more than 6,660 km² today.
Projects such as the Qingtongxia irrigation system, built in the 1950s, and modern flood and supply control works have not only agriculture, but also urban, industrial and ecological supply.
"Desertification is a prolonged challenge, but Ningxia has shown that it is possible to contain desert advance, restore ecosystems and create sustainable development," said Wang Xiaolin.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 04:12:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing warns on the UN to danger the return of the “jungle law”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/29/pequim-alerta-na-onu-para-perigo-do-regresso-da-lei-da-selva/</link><description>China has committed itself to the United Nations General Assembly to work with the international community in conflict resolution and warned of the danger of the return of the "jungle law." "If the age of the jungle law will come back (…), humanity will face more bloodshed," warned Prime Minister Li Qiang by speaking at the UN headquarters in New York, representing Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Li recalled that the UN, that China is one of the founding members, was created after World War II (1939-1945) and said that since then humanity has lived 80 years of relative tranquility. He stated that the desire for peace and development is now stronger than ever and asked the international community not to be silent or submit to "for fear of the powerful" in the face of injustices.
He considered that the world lives again a period of transformation and that “the Cold War mindset is returning”, with the world order to be questioned and the international system of the last 80 years to be disturbed.
Li said humanity is "once again in a crossroads" and that the various problems that currently affect the world worry the government of China. "How can we ignore the atrocities that make justice disappear and be impassive to what we see," he asked.
Li defended solidarity and cooperation among peoples, regardless of their differences, so that it is possible to avoid further global conflicts and, on the contrary, to foster economic development.
In this sense, multilateralism highlighted as the only way to promote peace and progress, and criticized protectionism in world trade, although without referring to the United States, which imposed unilateral customs rates. Li said that China is ready to “adopt effective and coordinated measures” with all parts that allow you to achieve more concrete solutions to peace and stability in the world.
He asked all UN members to work together for world security, noting that it is important to respect the “legitimate concerns” of private countries.
Equality and fraternity
Li also said that China is the second largest contributor to the Peace Maintenance Budget and the country that provides the most soldiers to the UN forces among security board countries.
The prime minister said President Xi Jinping has proposed a global view of the world, based on respect between nations and multilateralism. "Only when all countries receive an equal treatment and a true multilateralism is that the rights and interests of all can be protected," he added.</description><pubDate>2025-09-29 04:08:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Philippines raise alert due to the bualoi tropical storm after super typhoon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/26/filipinas-elevam-alerta-devido-a-tempestade-tropical-bualoi-apos-super-tufao/</link><description>The Philippines yesterday raised the alert level due to the strong winds and rains caused by the Tropical Storm Bualoi, which could become typhoon before reaching the northern coast of the archipelago today.
Parts of the island of Luzon, in the north, and central Visayas were placed at the second level of alert, of a total of five, in the face of approaching a gust of wind that reached 135 kilometers per hour yesterday and which is 365 kilometers to the east of the country, according to the National Meteorological Agency (Pagasa).
Known locally as Opong, the system "will continue to intensify as long as it remains on the seafront of the Philippines and can reach the typhoon category before playing Earth in the Bicol region," Pagasa warned yesterday. The body predicts that the cyclone reaches the south of Luzon this morning and afternoon, then crossing the interior of the country and affecting Manila, before heading southern China.
ALL STOPPED
The presidential palace ordered yesterday the suspension of work in public offices and classroom classes in various provinces, including Sussogon and Master, due to the effects of the storm. The arrival of Bualoi occurs scarce days after Super Typhoon Ragasa hit the northern Philippines on Monday, causing at least ten dead, 17 injured and thousands of displaced people.
Phenomena like this are recurrent in Southeast Asia, where the hot waters of the Pacific feed the formation of cyclones. Philippines are hit every year by about two dozen tropical storms, especially between June and December, during the rainy season.
The archipelago also lives a wave of indignation due to alleged cases of corruption in flood control millionaire projects, designed to protect the population from the effects of tufts and full and officially completed, but in practice do not exist or have poor quality.</description><pubDate>2025-09-26 07:25:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Li Qiang asks for the end of “politicization” in a meeting with von der Leyen</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/26/economia-li-qiang-pede-fim-de-politizacao-em-reuniao-com-von-der-leyen/</link><description>Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang called on to the European Union not to “politicize or security issues” commercial and investment disagreements, a meeting with the president of the European Commission (CE), Ursula Von Der Leyen.
Li recalled that both the July meeting in Beijing between the two leaders and the president of the European Council, António Costa, and the summit China - European Union then held served to reach consensus, which should now be put into practice, according to the official news agency Xinhua.
The Chinese ruler considered that the bilateral relationship has remained over five decades, despite international changes, thanks to the “fluid dialogue” and looking for solutions to differences.
Li argued that Brussels compromises the commitments of keeping trade and investment markets open and reiterated Beijing's rejection to which economic divergences are transformed into political or security instruments. "China and EU should focus on common interests and expand cooperation for the benefit of both parties," he said, according to the statement issued by Xinhua.
Von der Leyen stressed that, like two of the world's leading economies, the European Union and China have the responsibility to reinforce dialogue, “increase mutual understanding” and advance cooperation in areas such as commerce, investment, the environment and the fight against climate change.
The meeting took place in a context of commercial tensions, marked by the rates applied by Brussels to Chinese eclectric vehicles and investigations against European agrifood products, issues that in July prevented greater political advancement in Beijing Summit.</description><pubDate>2025-09-26 07:19:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs | China asks companies to avoid US price wars</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/26/tarifas-china-pede-a-empresas-que-evitem-guerras-de-precos-nos-eua/</link><description>China has appealed to its companies operating in the United States to avoid prolonging price wars, a sign of Beijing's willingness to preserve the commercial truce achieved with Washington. The Minister of Commerce, Wang Wenta, broadcast the message at a meeting in New York with representatives of 10 Chinese sectors companies such as electronic trade, telecommunications and automotive components, according to a statement released yesterday by the tutelage.
Wang recalled that the two countries "have achieved a number of important consensus after several rounds of economic and commercial consultations" and said he hoped companies "understand the situation and respond positively."
The minister also appealed to the rejection of the so -called “internal and external involution”, a term used in China to describe excessive competition that results from overcapacity and leads to efforts dismissed with decreasing returns. In July, the Chinese Communist Party had already made a commitment to reinforce control over over -capacity sectors and regular local governments in investment attraction.
Wang's statements reflect the attempt to keep up with the improvement of Washington relations, but also the recognition of the risks associated with the escalation of exports to other markets. During the US trade war, exports from China to India, Africa and Southeast Asia increased significantly, raising fears of negative impacts on local industries.
In New York, Wang has promised that China "will strive to stabilize Sino-American economic and commercial cooperation, firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and create a good environment for mutually beneficial cooperation between companies in both countries."</description><pubDate>2025-09-26 07:15:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Climate | Xi Jinping announces commitments in the fight against global crisis</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/26/clima-xi-jinping-anuncia-compromissos-na-luta-contra-crise-global/</link><description>The Chinese president announced today new commitments from the country in the fight against global climate rupture, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions between 7 and 10 percent by 2035, compared to current numbers.
“China will reduce its net emissions of saw -effect gases in its 7-10 percent economy in relation to peak level,” which is still unknown, but can be reached this year, Xi Jinping said in his video intervention, in the summit on the UN climate. "The green and low carbon transition is the trend of our time," he said. "Although some countries act against it, the international community should keep its course."
To this day, China had never been committed to an accurate number of short or medium term. It is now attributed as a goal to achieve carbonic neutrality by 2060 and promises that its maximum emissions will be achieved before 2030, which seems to be on the run of 2025, thanks to the success of the solar row and electric vehicles.
The new Chinese commitments to Horizon 2035 include the increase in the non -fossil energies in total energy consumption above 30 percent. The International Energy Agency quoted the renewable part by 12 percent in the year 2021. Another commitment is to multiply the installed wind and solar energy capacity, compared to 2020, to reach 3,600 GW, above 1,400 GW today.
XI also mentioned the growth of electric vehicles and the extension of the carbon market and the forest surface. "These objectives represent the best efforts of China, according to the demands of the Paris Agreement. To achieve these objectives needs rigorous efforts from China, as well as an open and supportive international environment," he said.
A replica
Environmental organization Greenpeace considered yesterday that the new climate goals in China to 2035 "fall short" from global objectives, although it admits that the country's effective decarbonization can advance beyond the one presented by Beijing.
"The goal for 2035 offers few guarantees of keeping the planet safe, but the hopeful is that the real decarbonization of the Chinese economy is probably exceeding what is on the role," said Yao Zhe, Greenpeace East Asia's global policy advisor. According to the expert, “the amount of wind and solar energy that is entering the energy matrix” supports this expectation.
In a statement, the NGO stressed that the current expansion of renewables and the role of China in solutions for energy transitions in other countries set a "base" for a "eventual reinforcement" of goals.
"In the end, the facts speak louder than the words. But firm and consistent political signs are an irreplaceable catalyst," Yao said, adding that "business and technological advances are not enough" and defending the usefulness of guiding objectives, both for internal transition and global climate action.
Greenpeace has appealed to Beijing to "keep the door open" to adjust the goals "very ready," warning that "waiting for another five years will be too late." This month, organizations such as Greenpeace itself had already pointed out that the advancement of renewables and electrification is reconfiguring the energy system of China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
Between 2015 and 2023, the use of fossil fuels in final consumption fell 1.7 percent, while electrical demand increased by 65 percent. In the first half of 2025 alone, wind capacity grew 16 percent and solar 43 percent, and the year ended in June the sum of both surpassed the water, nuclear and combined bioenergia production, according to reports from Greenpeace and the EMBER organization.
According to Embber, the expected reduction in the use of fossil fuels in China, combined with the overall expansion of cleaning technologies favored by the descent of costs, “may include the balance” to a structural decline in worldwide coal, oil and gas demand.
The respective rejoinder
China claimed to be “the world's most determined, energetic, and effective country” in meeting emissions reduction goals after the announcement of new climate objectives made by President XI Jinping on the UN.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun has highlighted at a press conference that "this is the first time China proposes an absolute goal of reducing emissions, covering the entire economy and all greenhouse gases."
According to Guo, "China's determination and actions to actively face climate change have constantly made it the country more decided, energetic and effective in fulfilling its commitments." "We will continue to defend the concept of a community shared for humanity and to make every effort to implement our goals," he added.
The spokesman cited Xi Jinping, who, in a video message directed at the UN General Assembly, admitted that fulfilling the goals "represents a hard effort for China" and requires "a solid and open international environment." "We are willing to cooperate with all parties to promote international cooperation in climate change and boost the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement," said Guo.</description><pubDate>2025-09-26 07:11:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Wanted 124 missing in Taiwan after Super Typhoon Ragasa</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/25/procurados-124-desaparecidos-em-taiwan-apos-super-tufao-ragasa/</link><description>Relief teams were trying to establish contact with 124 missing persons in Taiwan after the overflow of a lake, due to the passage of Super Typhoon Ragasa, the most powerful storm registered on the planet in 2025.

At least 14 people died in eastern Taiwan, following the overflowing of a natural lake that flooded the city of Guangfu, as a result of the intense rainfall caused by Super Typhoon Ragasa.
The center's deputy commander, Hsiao Huan-Chang, explained that the water torrent is so saturated with mud that "the vehicles can barely arrive," which required "the mobilization of a large number of military, police and firefighters." The local Fire Department explained that, of the 14 deadly victims, most were elderly who lived on the ground floor of Guangfu buildings, the municipality most affected by floods.
According to local authorities, the transhipment of the lake occurred on Tuesday afternoon, when the Natural Dam of the Matai'an stream ceded and released a large flow of water loaded with mud and debris. The flood destroyed a bridge over a stream and quickly flooded the Guangfu urban center, where several streets were submerged to the roof level in some areas.
Images released by the local media show residents to climb the roofs and vehicles waiting for help while the water covers large areas of the municipality.
Evacuation orders
Hours earlier, the authorities had warned that the natural lake, located in the neighboring town of Wanrong, could overflow, which led to evacuation orders, bed cleaning and reinforcement of surveillance. Hualien County is among the most affected by the rains associated with the passage of Super Typhoon Ragasa, which kept a warning much of Southeast China and Taiwan.</description><pubDate>2025-09-25 01:08:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Jorge Figueira, architect and academic at the University of Coimbra: “The Heroic Relations” of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/jorge-figueira-arquitecto-e-academico-da-universidade-de-coimbra-as-relacoes-heroicas-de-macau/</link><description>It has long written and thinks architecture, and since time Jorge Figueira, architect, academic at the University of Coimbra, does it in Macau. After a session this week that highlighted the former Fai Chi Kei Public Housing Complex, Manuel Vicente, Jorge Figueira today approaches the Rui Cunha Foundation O Legado de Nuno Portas
 
Today participates in the Conference “Nuno Portas: From Architecture to Urbanism, from man to city”. What legacy did this Portuguese architect have left?
Nuno Portas is someone who in the late 1950s has a critical activity that is totally innovative and pioneering in the Portuguese context. Then, in the 1960s, he had a more international activity, having been the first to publicize the work of Siza Vieira. That's when he had the first contacts with Spanish and Italian architects, fundamentally. Also in these years he wrote two books that were also unusual, such as “Architecture for Today” in 1964, and “City as Architecture” from 1969. They were also an extraordinary way to try to catch what was going on in terms of international currents in architecture. But then there was also a [important] activity as an architect alongside Nuno Teotónio Pereira, namely in the work of the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Lisbon, and in a house in Vila Viçosa. Then, with April 25, 1974, he was appointed Secretary of State for Housing and Urbanism and launches the Saal - Outpatient Services to Local Support, a completely revolutionary social housing program, according to the spirit of the time. Then Nuno Portas devoted himself more to the issues of urbanism and not so much of architecture. He was linked to the beginning of Expo 98. It turns out to be someone who in the last 20 years of his work has more scientific and sociological concerns, and less artistic. It's something you had from the beginning, but then it becomes the hundred of your activity.
Did Nuno Portas have a relationship with Macau?
I think relationships would not be so intense compared to other architects and contexts, but we know that Nuno Portas was in Macao at the government's invitation to a conference between 2001 and 2002. It is interesting because of this passage we have echoes of what happened, as his surprise when discovering the Ellen Liang orphanage of Manuel Vicente, he did not know. It was the first work of Manuel Vicente in Macau, from the 60s, and we know that Nuno Portas was thrilled to visit this work, especially the small chapel that exists in the orphanage. It is interesting because there was no direct relationship between Manuel Vicente and Nuno Portas, they are very different poles figures, and even opposite. There is also an interesting and positive reference to the Siza [Vieira, Expansion Plan of the city of Macao (Areia Preta and Outdoor Port, 1982], and when Nuno Portas visits Macau is being built. It is interesting to have commented on this plan because in the 60s and 70s the relationship between Nuno Portas and Siza Vieira was no longer the same, and the fact that he had made complimentary references to Siza is very interesting.
He was a student of Nuno Portas. What other aspects of your career or personality can highlight?
I also worked with him. He was a cultured man, very intelligent and with an overwhelming memory. It was someone who liked to provoke, but in a good way, to discuss, to counteract. I was lucky enough to maintain a dialogue with him for decades, and this is my personal knowledge that I will convey. I also notice that it was a man very close to the power of Lisbon, the parties, but always very independent. He was a personal friend of Jorge Sampaio, he was secretary of state, but never had great political protagonism. On the one hand, this is due to his independence, but on the other he was such a controversial and intelligently restless figure that I think power was also startled by him.
This week also spoke at the “Lisbon, Porto, Macau, Maputo: Heroic Collective Housing from the 60s &amp; 70s” conference. How do you describe Macau's public housing projects in those years?
There are many architects that I could talk about, but I focused on Manuel Vicente's work in Macau, namely the public housing complex at Fai Chi Kei, which was demolished and then gave rise to the project of Rui Leão and Carlota Bruni. I did not speak concretely about Portuguese or Macanese architects, we also have names such as José Ways. Also because the Portuguese architects have always been few in Portugal, and from the 1950s there were about 150, then greatly increasing in number. But I made [at the conference] a tribute to the Portuguese architects who built during this period, because in a complex territory and with their vicissitudes, different from those that existed in Portugal, they knew how to do architectural experiences in the field of extraordinary public housing. I tried to demonstrate what was happening in Lisbon, Porto, Macao and Lourenço Marques, currently Maputo, in different ways. In Macao, relations were established, which I call heroic, in the sense that they were relations of experimental architecture, in which people had to adapt, to have their own spirit. These are architectures already with a little history, as it has passed 50 or 60 years, but the examples we find in these cities have continued to be remarkable.
What projects highlight these years?
I talked about Gonçalo Byrne's housing development “Pantera Pantera” in Chelas, Lisbon. I showed the “five fingers”, by Vítor Figueiredo, also from Lisbon, and the “Bouça neighborhood”, from Siza Vieira, in Porto. I showed Manuel Vicente's Fai Chi Kei complex and a Pancho Guedes project in Mozambique. Although they are already distant in time, these are architectures that remain fundamental references of the cultural and architectural points of view. There is a kind of narrative luck to be able to talk about such different sites, and with such different architects, and show how they had this heroic, experienced, even radical, experienced side that had the architecture of this particular period.
Has Macao had a positive evolution with regard to public housing supply?
I arrived in August and have been visiting the territory in recent years, so I have been following this process a little. Macao is obviously an extraordinary territory and from the outset by the coexistence of very different cultures regarding housing, which here has a completely different scale and expression of the Portuguese. In Portugal there is an aversion to public housing towers, it has always been unusual and the results that are known have not been successful for various reasons. But in Macao this is exactly what we see, public housing in towers and with a very strong expression. This has to do with the characteristics of the territory and also with a certain culture of China and Hong Kong. This is not to say that everything that is being built in Macau is good, there are towers and buildings with less interesting solutions or that result from a certain repetition. But there is no city that only has good architecture or good public housing. The challenge is to solve the large -scale housing problem, something that must be studied and thought. It is beautiful and overwhelming to see that Macau is a territory that grows day after day and it is exciting to observe this from the point of view of architecture. This is what I am doing, working on future projects.
Analysis projects, or academic?
Yes, I am a teacher and researcher at the University of Coimbra and columnist for the public newspaper, so my work is very much to analyze and investigate. I already published a lot about Macau and I want to resume some ends that I left to solve, let's say. I am very stimulated with everything I have seen and the people I have spoken with, and maybe I will increase my work on the territory from an academic point of view and at the plan of the investigation.
At a time when Portugal has a chronic housing problem, with a lack of public housing, could Macau be an example?
No directly, because of the typological issue of the housing tower. It might not be a welcome model in the Portuguese context. But no doubt Portugal needs to learn from other experiences and other territories and need to find solutions. Surely what happens in Hong Kong and Macau are experiences that are very interested in knowing, not to replicate, but to realize that this is a global problem [the lack of housing].
Remember Nuno Portas
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) receives today, from 6.30 pm, the Conference “Nuno Portas: From Architecture to Urbanism, from man to city”, with Jorge Figueira. It will be time to talk about a route that the newly failed architect began in 1959, with a text about the new generation of the modern movement in Portugal. Texts followed in the 1960s and 70s with “scientific approaches”, with Nuno doors to a walk between architecture and urbanism, always in a reflective way. Nuno Portas was a “multifaceted figure, better known for launching the Saal Social Housing Program, which is still the target of investigation and an example”, describes Jorge Figueira in a note. The speaker is linked to the Center Social Studies and Department of Architecture of the University of Coimbra.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:33:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, Academic: “China is a reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended at the University of Aveiro the doctoral thesis that analyzes how China has been positioned in recent decades as an important actor in the “global health governance”. Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that the willingness already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy.
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages ​​in the neighboring Special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary general has ensured that he had “pleasing to work with all parties,” but stressed that this is a “decision that is up to central governments to make” and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the secretary general of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting economic development and cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, it is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new direction of the fund "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, in this case, the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibilization of the rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo.

Porque decidiu embrenhar-se na escrita de mais uma biografia sobre Camões? 
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies inquired live below the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | FIA makes known 10 teams from the FR World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/12/gp-fia-da-a-conhecer-10-equipas-da-taca-do-mundo-fr/</link><description>On Wednesday night, the International Automobile Federation (FIA), in partnership with the Macao Grand Prix Organizing Committee, published the official list of teams registered for this year's Macao Grand Prix-FR DA Mundo Cup.

They won the first weekend race, thus reaching the sixth triumph of the season, and finished second in the second race. This second place raised to 10 the number of podiums obtained in 10 races, extending the impressive team series, which never ended below second place.
With two races still playing in the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals in Misano, Italy, in November, SJM Theodore Racing could focus on maintaining this impressive podium sequence, with the main objective of the season achieved. Charles Leong and Alex Denning are tied at the top of the pilot standings and are expected to complete the season side by side, sharing the same Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2.
Always adding
For Charles Leong, this result is the result of “incredible team work. We won the championship thanks to a great collective effort, without great mistakes and with total consistency. For the race, I expected more group, but it was hard to fight my opponents with new tires. In the end, followed my pace and managed the tires to deliver the best car to Alex.
After finishing in second place in the classification of this same monomoccotes, the Macao pilot adds this title to those who won at an early age in the Renault Formula Asian Championship and the China Formula 4 Championship, in addition to the two remarkable victories in the Macao Formula 4 Macao Grand Prix.

Since 2019, the classic proof of resistance was not disputed, and to mark the return of this iconic race in the Rising Sun Country, Porsche Motorsport Asia Pacific decided to decorate the three cars that supported with historic colors of the Stuttack brand. Among them, one of Absolute Racing's Porsche 911 GT3 R was painted yellow and black, in honor of Joest Racing's victory in the 1985 Le Mans, when Portuguese Domingos Piedade was a sports director of the German team.

The charismatic British pilot continues to recover from the serious accident suffered at Isle of Man TT last June and is not fit to fight for tenth victory
 
In early summer, in the great classic of road, Michael Rutter fell off the motorcycle on the last lap of the Suartwin race, in the place known as 31st Milestone, and suffered several fractures in the spine, between the L2 and L5 vertebrae, even being transferred by helicopter to the hospital. The 53 -year -old pilot was also diagnosed with an ankle fracture.
After nearly three months away from the competition, “The Blade”, as he is known in the middle, made his return to motorcycling last August, participating in the famous classic TT parade, on top of a Honda RVF750 RC45, integrated in a tribute to the 1980s and 1990s. Of his nine wins in 1998, he went back to a motorcycle for the first time in the Classic TT, where he led a Honda RC45 in the 1980s and 1990s parade. However, Rutter is not yet prepared to return to the competition, the Irish publication News Letter said in the past week.
His last victory was achieved at the Guide Circuit in 2019, although not the way Rutter would like to have increased his palm, as the result was decided on the basis of positions after just one lap, after two red flag interruptions that led to the definitive cancellation of the race. Still with ambition to win a tenth time at the Macao Motorcycle Prize last year, deeply affected by bad weather, Rutter was disappointed with the result, having qualified with the fourth best time, in a race in which the result of the qualification determined the final positions of the race.
Before the accident at Isle of Man TT, Rutter had told News Letter that he wanted to travel to Macau at the end of the year. "We'll try again because it's another race that I really like to go. It's completely unique, it's on the other side of the world, one time zone, so it's unique," he said without knowing what he expected.
Another big question
Rutter may not be the only "historical" of the Macao Motorcycle Prize to be left out of this year's edition, as many doubts around Peter Hickman, he also victims of an accident at the Event of the Island of Man. The British accident was caused by a mechanical failure: the setting of the exhaust departed, causing it to come into contact with the rear tire and caused a hole that led to the fall of the experienced. Pilot. The winner of four editions suffered severe injuries: collarbone and left -blavado fracture, three broken ribs, four fractured vertebrae and still facial injuries.
In a social media publication, Hickman said he has worked “very hard” behind the scenes and even recently performed a test on Cadwell Park. Three months after the accident, he returned this weekend to the popular British Superbike Championship in Donington Park. The 38 -year -old has not yet recovered his best and the requirement of a city circuit, such as Macao, is far superior to a conventional circuit. So in the coming weeks it will be known if Hickman will try to conquer his fifth victory on the streets of Macau in 2025.
The 72nd Macau Grand Prix will take place between November 13 and 16 this year. In addition to the 57th Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, the program also features the Macao Grand Prix -FR's FR's World Cup, the FIA ​​GT GT Cup, the Macao Guide Race -Kumho Fia TCR World Tour of Macau, the Macao Formula 4 -FIA Formula 4 Cup (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge.</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 02:43:40</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Event literature is expected to grow in the coming years</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/01/gp-literatura-do-evento-devera-crescer-nos-proximos-anos/</link><description>The literature on the Macau Grand Prix could continue to grow in the coming years.

A book about motorcycles
The literature on the Macau Grand Prix could continue to grow in the coming years. Carlos Barreto, the author of the book Karting History in Macau, written in co -authorship with Pedro Dá Mesquita, is considering writing a book about motorcycling in the Macao Grand Prix, a discipline that sometimes ends up in the background in terms of literary coverage of the more than seventy years of the Guide Circuit event.
"The idea is to gather the testimonials of pilots from Macao who participated in the proof of motorcycles of the Macao Grand Prix," Carlos Barreto told HM. “We already have some material collected; there is still a lot of collection of collecting, compiling and writing the story, selecting the images, etc… We are in a hurry!”
The Macao Grand Prix today has only one motorcycle test on the program, the Macao de Motorcycle History, but it wasn't always like that. The event even had more than three motorcycle races, and even scooter races took place at the Citadino Circuito da MSA, always with a very strong presence of local pilots.</description><pubDate>2025-09-01 03:08:38</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
