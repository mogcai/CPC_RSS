In a speech before the Portuguese consul and Forum Macau delegates, Sam Hou Fai highlighted the importance of the guidelines proposed by Xi Jinping during his visit to Macau
 
Macau and Portuguese-speaking countries must strengthen business cooperation. This was one of the main highlights of the Chief Executive's speech at the reception dinner for the consuls general in Macau and the delegates from Portuguese-speaking countries at Forum Macau.
Sam Hou Fai called for the improvement of “various exchange and cooperation mechanisms” between Macau and Portuguese-speaking markets, to “comprehensively leverage exchange and cooperation at the private sector level”.

Macau's financial reserve is close to recording its best year since the pandemic, after earning 37.5 billion patacas in the first 11 months of 2024, it was announced yesterday. According to data from the Macau Monetary Authority (AMCM), this could be the highest annual increase since 2019, when the value of the reserve increased by 70.6 billion patacas.
The Macao SAR's financial reserve gained 22.2 billion patacas in 2023, after having lost almost four times that amount in the previous year.
The value of the reserve amounted to almost 618 billion patacas at the end of November, the highest value since March 2022, according to data published in the Official Bulletin. Still, the value remains far from the record of 663.6 billion patacas reached in February 2021, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The territory's financial reserve gained 4.63 billion patacas in November, compared to October, the month in which it suffered the second drop in 2024.
The value of the extraordinary reserve at the end of November was 431.9 billion patacas and the basic reserve, equivalent to 150 percent of Macau's public budget for this year, was 153.4 billion patacas.
Budget forecast surplus
The budget for 2024 predicted a 1.4 percent increase in total expenditure, to 105.9 billion patacas. The financial reserve is mainly made up of deposits and current accounts worth 243.2 billion patacas, credit securities worth 121.6 billion patacas and up to 247.1 billion patacas in subcontracted investments.
In January 2024, AMCM highlighted that the investments yielded almost 29 billion patacas to the financial reserve in 2023, corresponding to a profitability rate of 5.2 percent.
This is despite the fact that, in 2023, the region's authorities transferred almost 10.4 billion patacas from the financial reserve to the public budget.
Macau's budget for 2024 predicted the return of surpluses in public accounts, anticipating a positive balance of 1.17 billion patacas, without “the need to resort to the financial reserve”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:17:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Flu | Government says it is satisfied with vaccination</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/gripe-governo-diz-estar-satisfeito-com-vacinacao/</link><description>With the flu season and respiratory infections reaching their peak, the Government is satisfied with vaccination and indicates that the number of patients admitted to hospitals in the region is “relatively stable”. Furthermore, cases of acute flu have decreased compared to the previous year
 
The head of the Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Leong Iek Hou, said yesterday that the number of patients hospitalized at Centro Hospitalar Conde São Januário and Hospital Kiang Wu due to influenza is in a “relatively stable” state. The official outlined the situation on the Forum Macau program, on the Chinese channel Radio Macau, revealing that this year there have been fewer cases of acute flu than last year, with the proportion of patients with fever reaching around 16, 2 percent.
The person in charge, who was one of the protagonists during the times of Covid-19, revealed that “the general situation of this year's flu vaccination is satisfactory”. As of last Sunday, more than 179,000 people had been vaccinated against the flu in Macau. The vaccination rate for the elderly in social support institutions stood at 93 percent, while 62 percent of children and more than 80 percent of pre-school and primary school students were inoculated in daycare centers. In relation to secondary schools, the vaccination rate reached almost 70 percent, while adults over 65 recorded a vaccination rate of 55 percent.
However, the official predicted that the flu virus will be active until February, but that other respiratory viruses, such as adenovirus, will continue to be active in winter and spring. As such, Leong Iek Hou recommended the flu vaccine for those who have not yet had one, pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and use a mask to avoid simultaneous infections with multiple pathogens.
Small and large
In a global context, the deputy director of Education and Youth Development Services, Wong Ka Ki, stated that the vaccination rate of non-tertiary education students is almost 80 percent. The official added that students can receive the flu vaccine during school hours with excused absences.
On the other hand, in daycare centers and day centers for the elderly and disabled, control systems have been implemented with daily check-ups first thing in the morning to detect infections or monitor the progress of patients.
Leong Iek Hou also warned the population to be careful about mixing medications, which can interact and cause health problems, and not to buy them on their own in pharmacies, without a prescription or medical recommendation. The official also said that citizens should not purchase medicines to store at home.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:13:47</pubDate></item><item><title>EPM | MICE gave “precise” instructions to restore “regular functioning”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/epm-mice-deu-instrucoes-precisas-para-repor-regular-funcionamento/</link><description>Given the “official” lack of knowledge on the part of the Association Promoting Education for Macanese (APIM) of the intention to build a new block at EPM, the Minister of Education, Science and Innovation says he is monitoring the situation and indicates that Jorge Neto Valente has been appointed by the previous minister
 
The Minister of Education, Science and Innovation of Portugal claims to be “vigilant” regarding the operation of the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) and argues that the representatives of the Portuguese State at the Foundation of the Portuguese School of Macau (FEPM) received “precise instructions for the restoration of the regular functioning of the EPM”. It was in this way that Fernando Alexandre reacted, to HM, through his office, when asked about the recent dispute between the president of FEPM, appointed by the Portuguese State, and the Associação Promotora da Instrução dos Macaenses (APIM), over the announcement of the construction of a new block, which will not have been discussed by the FEPM Board of Directors.
“The current Minister of Education, Science and Innovation is vigilant regarding the functioning of the EPM and has remained permanently informed, with precise instructions having been transmitted to the representatives of the Portuguese State to restore the regular functioning of the EPM”, it can be read, in the response sent to HM.
Last week, Jorge Neto Valente, as president of FEPM, revealed his intention to build a new block in the building where the school operates and considered that the concession of the land where the EPM building is located had expired in 2014.
The announcement came as a surprise to APIM, the land concessionaire, which, in a statement sent to Canal Macau, stated that it was officially unaware of the intention to build a block. The message signed by Miguel de Senna Fernandes, president of APIM and vice-president of FEPM, also states that the matter was not discussed by the FEPM Board of Directors. The statement also denies that there was any expiry of the land in 2014.
The ministry did not detail the instructions issued in the response to HM, but in August last year, after an inspection carried out by the General Inspectorate of Education and Science (IGEC) on the functioning of the EPM, Fernando Alexandre left a correction to the functioning of the Council of Administration of FEPM, highlighting the need for decisions to be taken by the five members of the council, and not just by the president.
Currently, the FEPM CA is made up of five members: three chosen by the Portuguese State, namely Jorge Neto Valente, as president, Patrícia Ribeiro and Raul Capaz, one member chosen by the Associação Promotora da Instrução dos Macaenses (APIM), Miguel de Senna Fernandes , vice-president, and another member resulting from the consensus of the CA, who is currently José Basto da Silva.
Legacies of the past
Regarding the existence of yet another dispute within the FEPM Board of Directors, after the dismissal of several teachers last year, Fernando Alexandre pointed out that the appointment of Jorge Neto Valente to the position of president of the FEPM Board of Directors was decided by the previous Minister of Education, João Costa.
“The current president of the Foundation of the Portuguese School of Macau was appointed to occupy the position by the previous Minister of Education”, it was indicated.
In the statement sent to Canal Macau, and contrary to what had been stated by Neto Valente, APIM also argued that although the land is allocated to the provision of educational services, there is no obligation for these to be provided by EPM. In relation to this aspect, and when asked about the possibility of APIM advancing a possible eviction, which would create the need to find a plan B, the Government of Portugal rejected this scenario, and indicated that APIM has “always maintained an attitude of full respect for her role as founder” of FEPM.
The ministry also argued that, in accordance with the Statutes of the Fundação Escola de Macau, “the provision of the land in question by APIM, as founder, forms part of the initial capital of the EPM Foundation” and “only by the extinction of FEPM could the land be allocated for another purpose.”</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:07:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Death / Rocha Vieira: Macau remembers last Portuguese Governor</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/obito-rocha-vieira-macau-recorda-ultimo-governador-portugues/</link><description>The last governor of Macau, Vasco Rocha Vieira, who died at the age of 85, laid the foundations for the success of the Chinese region and defended the rights of public servants, although with “some disagreements”, local leaders told Lusa. Vasco Rocha Vieira, former Army Chief of Staff between 1976 and 1978, died in the early hours of Monday at the age of 85, an official source from that military branch confirmed to Lusa.
“He is an illustrious figure, fundamental in the history of Macau's transition, but also, to a certain extent, in the present and future”, said José Sales Marques, president of Leal Senado, the former city council, between 1993 and 1999. “There is a lot something that was done during that period and that continues today. The bases of the Macau Special Administrative Region also have a lot to do with the work of Lieutenant General Rocha Vieira”, argued Sales Marques.
Rocha Vieira served as governor of Macau between 1991 and 1999, when the territory was transferred to China. It was during his mandate that the construction of the city's airport was completed.
The Macau that Rocha Vieira found and left “doesn’t compare. What was done in all those years is something that history has already recorded”, defended Sales Marques. also a member of the then Rocha Vieira Advisory Council.
Former deputy António Ng Kuok Cheong told Lusa that, despite the distrust of the Chinese, the administration “tried to do something to encourage the economic growth of the city, which was very poor at that time, before returning Macau”.
António Ng, elected to the Legislative Assembly five months after Rocha Vieira's appointment, highlighted that the main obstacle was China's resistance to the liberalization of the gaming sector, which would only end up being launched in 2002.
Something that forced the Portuguese administration to sell land to finance infrastructure projects, inadvertently planting the roots of the housing problem that Macau currently faces, he said.
“They tried to sell the land openly, but the Chinese government stopped them. So most of the land was sold to powerful people in China at a very low price because Macau's economy was very weak,” Ng recalled. A class of landlords was created who, after Macau became the world capital of casinos, became rich by controlling supply and keeping housing prices high, lamented the former deputy.
The work of public servants
Jorge Fão, one of the founders of the Macau Public Service Workers Association (ATFMP), in 1987, noted that Rocha Vieira “fulfilled his mission as governor” and “dignified his country”.
The former president of ATFPM, heading the association “for more than ten years”, reminded Lusa that he was “a trade unionist before being a politician” and “had some disagreements” with the lieutenant general.
Fão explained that he was “one of the protagonists” who worked so that, after Macau’s transition to China, “public servants [of the Portuguese administration] were entitled to a pension” paid by Portugal.
“No official from the other colonies had the right (…) When there was talk of discussing the handover of Macau to China, we were very worried. We launched our union struggles and had several meetings with the governance of Portugal and Macau (…). We had some meetings and in those meetings we also had disagreements”, he recalled.
In the end, summarized the current president of the General Assembly of the Association of Retirees, Retirees and Pensioners of Macau, “the outcome was not bad”. “Everyone must be satisfied, I too took part in this fight and have been living on this pension for over 30 years”, he argued.
At the time of administration, there were around 3,600 retirees with pensions transferred to Portugal, he concluded. In 2022, Jorge Fão told Lusa that he believed that around two thousand retirees from the former Portuguese administration of Macau lived in the Chinese region.
PS praises life “entirely dedicated to the service of Portugal”
The PS expressed regret at the death of the last Portuguese governor of Macau, praising a life “entirely dedicated to the service of Portugal” of a “prestigious soldier” and one of the “best interpreters of the importance of Macau”.
Through a statement, the party led by Pedro Nuno Santos mourns the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, “prestigious soldier and last Governor of Macau under Portuguese administration”.
“His life was entirely dedicated to the service of Portugal, both in his military career and in his political participation following the 25th of April, as a member of the Council of the Revolution (due to his duties as Chief of Staff of the Army), Minister of the Republic in the Azores, Deputy Secretary of the Government of Macau and Governor of Macau”, states the same note.
Noting that “his life was forever linked to Macau”, for the PS this “was one of the best interpreters of the importance” of that territory “for the relationship between Portugal and the People's Republic of China”, as well as the uniqueness of the now region special administrative.
“The last years of the Portuguese administration of the Territory of Macau, under the leadership of General Rocha Vieira, are marked by the completion of several important public infrastructure works to support the subsequent development of Macau, as well as administrative reforms to prepare it for the subsequent period”, he praises.
Socialists also refer to the ceremony transferring sovereignty from the Territory of Macau to the People's Republic of China, in which the way in which Rocha Vieira “personified and symbolized the dignity and tribute to the Portuguese presence in Macau for centuries” was undeniable.
“And it marked the friendship and respect that the Portuguese maintain with Macau and the People's Republic of China, and which allows, after 25 years of transition, to preserve the uniqueness of Macau, which continues to be a meeting point between cultures”, he added.
The PS thus gives “public note of its deep respect for services to the country” and “addresses its deepest condolences to his family and friends”.
Words by Eanes
The former President of the Republic Ramalho Eanes classified Rocha Vieira as “an exceptional man” and “one of the best” among the greatest figures in Portugal.
“General Rocha Vieira was an exceptional man for his excellent actions and assumed social responsibility, deserving to be, rightly, considered ‘one of the best of our greatest’”, wrote António Ramalho Eanes in a note sent to the Lusa agency.
The first elected head of state of Portuguese democracy remembers Vasco Rocha Vieira as “an extraordinary man”, especially “on three levels: for his distinctive personality, for his relevant military performance and for the services provided to the country at a political level”.
On a personal level, Eanes considers that Rocha Vieira, who died today at the age of 85, “possessed superior qualities of spirit”, had “exceptional intelligence”, “a good temperament” and “had a strong personality”.
At a military level, “he was one of the most distinguished soldiers of his generation, providing relevant services to the Army, in difficult times, namely, in the throes of the political regime prior to the 25th of April, during the 25th of April and, even, on the 25th of November, having also played an important role as a representative of the Portuguese Armed Forces within NATO”.
Regarding the political level, Eanes concludes that Rocha Vieira had an activity of “great quality and great importance for the country, whether as minister of the Republic for the Azores, or even as governor of Macau, putting all his commitment into the design and execution , successfully, in a policy of successful transformation of Macau, also participating, with the success that is known, in the transfer of the administration of the territory of Macau to the People's Republic of China”.
Souvenirs from the Azores
The president of the Azorean parliament, Luís Garcia, also expressed regret at the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, recalling his “exemplary dedication to the public cause” and his “invaluable contribution” to the country and the Azores.
“Throughout his notable military and political career, Rocha Vieira revealed an unshakable sense of State, exemplary dedication to the public cause and a deep patriotism, which indelibly marked his service to Portugal”, states Luís Garcia in a note of condolence.
The president of the Legislative Assembly of the Autonomous Region of the Azores (ALRAA) states that he learned of the death of the lieutenant general, a “unique figure and one of the most illustrious officers of the Portuguese Army”, with “deep consternation”.
According to the note, Luís Garcia “expresses his deepest condolences to the bereaved family, leaving a deep testimony of gratitude for their invaluable contribution to the country and the Azores”.
“As Minister of the Republic for the Autonomous Region of the Azores, between 1986 and 1991, Vasco Rocha Vieira performed his duties with high commitment, contributing significantly to the strengthening of institutional relations and the enhancement of regional autonomy”, he states.
The ALRAA leader also highlights that the period in which Rocha Vieira was at the service of the Azores “is remembered as a time of dedication to dialogue and the building of bridges between the bodies of national sovereignty and the Region's own government bodies”.
“He will also be remembered for the symbolism of his action as the last Governor of Macau, a position he held between 1991 and 1999, when he led the transfer of the Portuguese administration to the Chinese one, in an example of a sense of responsibility and loyalty to public service that will be recorded in the collective memory of Portugal”, he concluded.
Portuguese PM speaks out

Here “a deep understanding of the pursuit of dreams” is reflected, mixing “auspicious Chinese symbols with modern design, creating a convincing dialogue between tradition and contemporary art”.
This exhibition also features “three thematic works of art specially commissioned and premiered in Macau”, called “Joy and Glory”, the interactive installation that gives the exhibition its name, “Boom and Bloom” and also “A Propicious Omen”, which “incorporates the concepts of love and prosperity, with the lotus – the symbol of Macau – giving a unique touch and representing fortune and harmony for the new year”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:02:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Death | French director Bertrand Blier dies aged 85</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/obito-realizador-frances-bertrand-blier-morre-aos-85-anos/</link><description>French director and screenwriter Bertrand Blier, author of “The Ballerinas” and “Evening Costume”, died on Monday in Paris, aged 85, his family revealed to the France-Presse agency.
For the newspaper Le Figaro, “one of the last giants of French cinema” died, who “knew how to invent his own cinematographic universe” and left “unforgettable films for several generations”.
The filmography, which began in the 1960s, includes, for example, “Hitler, connais pas” (1963), “As if I were a spy” (1967), in which his father, actor Bernard Blier, appears, “The woman from my best friend” and “What a hell of a life!” (1991), with Charlotte Gainsbourg and Anouk Grinberg.
Author of films marked by dark humor and grotesque comedy, Bertrand Blier won the Oscar for Best International Film in 1979 with “A Woman for Two”, starring Carole Laure, Gérard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere.
Gerard Depardieu was, in fact, one of the actors who worked most with Bertrand Blier and whose collaboration marked French cinema in the 1970s and 1980s, with emphasis on “The Ballerinas” (1974), “Crimes in Cold Blood” (1979), “ Too beautiful for you” (1989) and “How much do you love me” (2005).
Regarding “The Ballerinas”, with Depardieu and Dewaere, AFP recalls that this film was considered subversive and cult, and at the same time criticized “for its misogyny and the way it portrayed male predominance”. “Hitler, connais pas” (1963) won him a prize for first works in Locarno (Switzerland) and with “Too Beautiful for You” he won the Grand Jury Prize in Cannes.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:01:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Stock markets fall after Trump threatens to raise rates</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/economia-bolsas-caem-apos-trump-ameacar-com-subida-de-taxas/</link><description>Chinese stock markets fell during yesterday's session, after the new North American President, Donald Trump, suggested that he will apply 10 percent duties on imports from China, in retaliation for the flow of fentanyl.

They constitute the most paradoxical of all nations, equal to themselves four thousand years ago, a unique, coherent, passionate civilization.
They are the last survivors of the great agrarian civilizations of the Ancient Age. Egypt, Mesopotamia, the empires of Central America, everything vanished in the whirlwind of centuries. China remained, preserved its identity and culture, continued its History, its popular customs and traditions, its art, its poetry.
Like the Egyptians, the Chinese invented a complex script that uses pictographic and ideographic symbols. But if hieroglyphs from the time of the pharaohs are museum relics, Chinese characters still form today the most surprising and astonishing graphic representation of a language. Also the fundamental unifying element of the Chinese cultural monolith.
The Chinese are more numerous than Americans, Soviets and Europeans combined; however, its per capita domestic product is still far from that of the most advanced nations on the globe. They will soon surpass the North American economy, but it must be considered that China's population is five times larger, which unbalances any statistics. Almost two hundred years ago Napoleon raised the cry: “When China awakens, the world will tremble!” In 1974, French diplomat Alain Peyrefitte used the phrase as the title of his book, a bestseller in the Western Hemisphere. But it is true that China, the great Middle Kingdom, despite so much uproar, suffering and vigils, has more than woken up and is beginning to take the future into its own hands, it shakes the wheel of History, produces everything and pollutes almost everything. China makes the world tremble.
It is a paradoxical country, I repeat. With many millions of inhabitants living on less than two dollars a day, it has some of the most modern metropolises on the globe, launches and recovers satellites, sends men into space and probes to the moon and Mars, and has had atomic bombs since 1961.
It prides itself on possessing the most vast and voluminous literature ever written by any people and, however, in the 20th century it only produced one admirable and great writer, named Lu Xun 鲁迅. Quan Tang Shi 全唐詩, Complete Poetry of the Tang Dynasty — the golden age of Chinese poetry, from 618 to 907 — is an anthology composed of 48,900 poems by 2,300 different authors; However, in current China, illiteracy still affects around 5% of the population.
The Chinese, who were never a religious people — despite the twenty centuries of Confucianism as the official doctrine of the State —, deified Mao Zedong during the ten years of the catastrophic Proletarian Cultural Revolution and soon after distanced themselves, without much regret, from the majestic figure of the old “helmsman”, but today they continue to respect him as “father of New China.”
The Chinese, who have always enjoyed peace, personal comfort, good food and the pleasures of life, continue to be able to undergo the most arduous work and the harshest deprivations. “They suffer while smiling”, observed Ferreira de Castro, seventy years ago, in his “Around the World”.
China, which has some of the most beautiful women in the world, tried, until about three decades ago, through a radical morality, to deliberately present them as the ugliest.
China is an ocean of contradictions in which we, Westerners, always navigate in danger of sinking. This is why the journey, full of all its fascinations, into this country and these people is so difficult, and also why tremendous errors of analysis in relation to Chinese realities are common.
In China they say: “The foreigner who comes to our country for fifteen days writes a book, the one who stays for a few months writes some articles for the newspapers, the one who stays longer breaks his pen and never writes anything again.”
I know, from my own experience, that getting to know China over the years, living it inside almost to the point of exhaustion, produces a numbness of the will, a gentle torpor that is tormenting and gives pleasure. China, a land of people different from all other peoples, enters us, invades us and it becomes difficult to talk or write about the Chinese, because we know them better, that is, we ignore much more about them.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Paulo Maia and Carmo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Mi Fu (1051-1107), the unique Song dynasty calligrapher, poet and painter who cultivated strangeness in his personal life to abstain from the contamination of worldly affairs, ancient or modern paintings that he observed, wrote that these “things do not they touch or stir me when I sit cross-legged like a monk, forgetting all my problems and putting myself in harmony with the vast, blue void» (Huashi), would in the future be the object of an immense admiration.
In Dantu, one of the three districts of Zhenjiang (Jiangsu) where he lived for more than four decades, his memory is celebrated in a unique park in the country where you can see one thousand and three hundred copies of stone calligraphy engravings. Alluding to its source of inspiration, it was appropriately designed in front of the Hill of Ten Li, with aspects typical of landscape painting.
The admirable novelty of his art was praised by Emperor Huizong (r.1100-1125), who knew him and who in his vertical scroll Pavilion of the Awakening of the Clouds (ink on silk, 150 x 78.8 cm, at the Smithonian) transcribed the phrase from Confucius that highlights what will be noticed in paintings called shanshui, «rivers and mountains» in continuous mutation: «Before the sky send the rains of the season, mountains and rivers presented the clouds.»
In Mi Fu's paintings you can see this look at the changing fluid forms where the spirit could be revealed, unlike the drawings of animals or people that have stabilized forms (youdingxing).
His legacy was also and above all cultivated by painters over time. Pan Simu (1756-1839), already in the last dynasty seven hundred years later, was one of those who used horizontal dots applied with precision by brush on paper, depicting successive receding mountains that characterized the Mi Fu method.
Pan Simu like Zhang Yin or Pan Gongshou, painters from the city of Zhenjiang, sought to establish a "school" (parent) of painting based on the city's tradition. In this inquiry into memory, Pan Simu realized his affinity with Mi Fu. He did so, for example, in two vertical scrolls: The Crane Forest (Helin) misty in the rain (ink on paper, 128.9 x 31.4 cm, at the Minneapolis Institute of Art); and in Rain and Fog in Helin (ink on paper, 109.9 x 31.8 cm, at the Metmuseum).
In the latter he refers to a visit to the temple where Mi Fu's tomb was located on the Yellow Crane Mountain (Huanghe shan) writing a poem in which the expression "old fool", laodian, is a characteristic manifestation of the affectionate, somewhat harsh familiarity with which he they treated the adherents of the Dao; «The great fame of the crane forest extends for years and years,/ I spent the night there once in the spring and there I made this painting remembering the old fool./ If the old fool returned now, he would laugh saying;/ Who dared coming to steal my meditation on Chan?”</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Ana Cristina Alves</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves,

The Year 2025 will be commanded by the Yin Wood Serpent (乙巳蛇Yǐ sì shé), that is, from the sixth terrestrial branch, from the Wood element linked to the feminine principle, therefore to the lunar, mysterious and intuitive force. It begins, in official terms of the lunisolar calendar, on January 29, 2025 and ends on February 16, 2026, but for geomancy or fengshui (风水 fēngshuǐ) the year only begins on February 3 in the first spring, lichun (立春lìchūn ). This year, from the point of view of telluric blessings, will be particularly blessed because it will have two springs, with a second lichun on February 4, 2026.
And as for the Descendants of the Dragon “good things come in pairs” (好事成双 hǎo shì chéng shuāng), it promises good agriculture and fertility, being equally conducive to meditation and contact with nature, but also to social contacts, because The Wood Snake, given its element, is the most communicative, creative, friendly and supportive of relationships among these reptiles. Furthermore, this type of Madeira is defined by being hardworking, honest and popular, it is not always immediately recognized, which is why it brings as an ally the virtue of perseverance, which gives recognition for its efforts over time.
She is “the serpent that comes out of the hole” (Kwok, 1997, 67). It belongs to the time period between 9 am and 11 am. Although its fixed element is fire, as for example wood is that of the tiger, and its constant color is, depending on the element, red, in 2025 green, associated with Wood, will predominate.
The snake is the strongest sexual symbol and, therefore, in Indian yogic philosophies of the tantric line, which extend throughout Asia and, in particular, Southeast Asia, it is kundalini, as C.G. drew attention. Jung in The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga. Notes to a Seminar Given in 1932.
How do the Chinese relate to the serpent's vital force? At first they were quite spontaneous, they had an animistic philosophy that evolved into popular Taoism, but we must not forget that also from a very early age, starting with Confucius and the establishment of Confucianism, and in a systematic way since Han times, there have been In this culture there is a great determination to control natural energies. This trend redoubled with the acceptance of Buddhist philosophy, initially very distant from natural and tantric experiences.
During the times of the last Qing dynasty, religious experiences linked to Buddhism intensified and, as such, the conflict between natural and spiritual forces became manifest, opening a war similar to that seen in Christianity, with Eve and Adam fighting. being expelled from Paradise because of a supposedly infamous serpent.
The open war between natural forces and formal religion would still be recorded in Chinese literature, in one of the most poignant love stories, entitled The White Serpent (《白蛇传》Bái Shé Zhuàn), also known by the name of its protagonists Xu Xian (许仙Xǔ Xiān) and Bai Niangzi(白娘子Bái Niángzi), which reached its peak of popularity during the Qing dynasty.
In it, the lovers are hopelessly persecuted by a Buddhist bonzo, who destroys their happiness by insisting that Xu Xian (许仙) stay away from Bai Niangzi (白娘子), since she was an enchanted serpent.
Omitted by the bonzo would be the meditation effort that led the serpent to transfigure itself into human form.
What the Buddhist bonzo did not see, as many Christian religious people still fail to understand, is that on the exterior of what appears to be transgression there is hidden a natural and spontaneous force closely linked to the mind of those who deal with it. For a pure mind, natural force has nothing impure, for a clouded mind, force is, in the Western version, sin, and in the Eastern version, negative and demonic power.
The serpent's strength is complete in itself. There is nothing to add to it. Attesting to its perfect completeness, there is a much-told proverbial story, Drawing the Serpent's Feet (畫/画蛇添足Huà Shé Tiān Zú), often shortened into the expression The Serpent's Feet (Shé Zú蛇足).
Article帮忙办事的人很多，这壶酒如果大家都喝是不够的，若是让一个人喝，那能喝得有余。这一壶酒到底怎么分呢？大家都安静下来，这时有人建议：每个人在地上画一条蛇，谁画得快，这壶酒就归他喝。大家都认为这个方法Article
有个人画得很快, 一转眼最先画好了, 他就端起酒壶要喝酒。但Article他洋洋得意地说：“你们画得好慢啊！我再给蛇画几只脚也不算晚呢！”于是，他便左手提着酒壶，右手给蛇画起脚来。正在他一边给蛇画脚，一边说话的时候，另外一个人已经画好了。那个人马上把酒壶从他手里夺过去，说：“你见过蛇吗？蛇是没有脚的，你为什么要给它添上脚呢:而是我了！”个人说罢就仰起头来，咕咚咕咚把酒喝下去了。
Here is my translation:
In ancient times, in the Chu Kingdom (楚國/国Chǔ Guó), there was a feudal lord who, after having made the necessary ritual libations to his ancestors, still had a jug of wine left over, which he planned to distribute to his servants. But as there were many, the wine was not enough for everyone, but for one it would be more than enough. After all, how should it be shared? To calm them down, one of them suggested: “each one will draw a snake on the ground, whoever finishes first will get the jug of wine.” Everyone agreed with the idea and so they started drawing. There was one who was eager to drink it, so he sent the drawing away in the blink of an eye.
When he looked at the others, he saw that they hadn't finished yet, so he thought they were very slow and said triumphantly: "You are so slow that I even have time to add feet to the snake!" Then, while holding the jar with his left hand, he added the reptile's feet with his right hand. At the time I was drawing his feet and talking, someone else finished his drawing; Taking the jar from his hand, he said: “Have you ever seen a snake? If they don't have feet, why did you add them?! Therefore, the first one to draw a snake is not you, but me.” When he finished speaking, he raised his head and Gluglu downed his wine.
In a stylistic equivalent for Portuguese, the first winner had smudged the painting. In an ontological reading, there is nothing to add to a force complete in itself. Therefore, this saying is used to show someone doing something superfluous.
When the snake intends to be someone else, it has opened the path of metamorphosis, similar to that of the silkworm and the butterfly.
The Chinese are well aware of the power of the Serpent (shé 蛇), whose etymological reading is the radically other worm, the animal, the antithetical force of the civilized. This immense natural energy was renamed Little Dragon (小龙 Xiǎo Lóng) to give space to the reptile to cultivate and exercise on the spiritual path, on an inner journey from body to mind, without, however, losing its telluric roots. The serpent crawls on the earth, if it manages to rise to the heavens like a flying dragon, it brings about the union of the two primordial forces of the universe, that of Heaven and that of Earth, inside the human body and outside the cosmic body.

The building in the middle of the square, despite looking like a government site, is the city's exhibition hall. In the western part, two large shopping centers, one of them with a cinema, extend the street along which we are taken to the Grand Canal anchorage. In a small shelter at the entrance to the boarding pier, boat tickets to Suzhou are sold [this is the end of the 90s of the 20th century] and every day a boat leaves from there at half past five in the afternoon, on a journey made overnight by the Jiangnan channel [Jiangnan yunhe (江南运河)]. In the past, the route went to Wuxi, but this service had been disconnected for two years.
The Jiangnan Canal begins in Zhenjiang, on the south bank of the Changjiang (Yangzi or Yangtze), after the Grand Canal crosses the third largest river in the world, and to the south it follows its course through Danyang (丹阳), Changzhou (常州), Wuxi (无锡), Suzhou (苏州), Pingwang (平望), reaching Hangzhou where it connects to the Qiantang River.
At the counter, which seemed to guard the alley leading to the boarding gate, we bought a small one-bed ticket in a bunk compartment for 98 yuan for the next day, as two-bed cabins cost 115 yuan are sold out. They ask us to arrive at five in the afternoon, half an hour before departure.
I was looking at the pier from where two years ago I had left by boat to Suzhou and was now returning prepared to repeat the trip, but when I arrived at the pier I saw that it was being demolished. The boats for these trips continue to be anchored there, but they have now been suspended indefinitely. By pure chance, we noticed the movement at the end of the pier, with people waiting next to a triangle sign indicating that the boat had stopped. Upon inquiry, we found out that the trip to the old Nanxingqiao boarding pier (南星桥) is no longer available, located just before reaching the Sanlang temple, close to the southern bus terminal.
Now a boat route was open, which in a short ten-minute trip downstream, stops briefly at the Baziqiao zhan stop (坝子桥站), next to the Bazi bridge (坝子桥), and then returns to the pier where we had party. For five yuan we can look at one of the city's canal gates, which despite being closed lets trickles of water flow into the Grand Canal and looking like an attractive place, a bridge with three arches covered by a wooden roof is the gateway to a branch of the channel.
Also for five yuan, we are taken to the ancient Gongchen Bridge, next to the square where the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal Museum is located. And so we returned to visit this excellent museum, which created a new tourist hub for the city of Hangzhou.
Models of boats are on display there, and you can see the routes of maritime travel over the centuries and the centuries of construction of the Grand Canal, its sponsors and the way in which the obstacles presented were resolved to make this route a direct connection between the capital of the North and the rest of China.
ON THE GREAT CANAL
Only with the new opening of the country to tourism in 1978 did interest appear to take new advantage of this great work of engineering. Goods continued to be transported via the Grand Canal, although parts of the route were interrupted, as navigation had been abandoned since the end of the 19th century. In response, in 1981 Wuxi tourism entities opened a trip between Suzhou and Yangzhou and another from Lake Tai to Hangzhou.
The boat made available for tourism was a faithful replica of Emperor Sui's dragon boat, Yangdi. In the late 90s, trips were made between Hangzhou and Suzhou and from there to Wuxi the boats were now normal double-decker passenger boats. Then, in the second or third year after the beginning of the 3rd millennium, the trip stopped taking place to Wuxi and only took place between Hangzhou and Suzhou and in 2007 this was interrupted. We believe, to restructure it and prepare new boats for tourists to enjoy the beauty of the landscapes and the History of the Grand Canal.
At five in the afternoon we arrived at the pier, half an hour before departure. Fifteen minutes past the hour, at a quarter to six we are sailing through the waters of the Grand Canal. The delay was due to the bicycles of the cycle tourism group having to be packed onto the boat, arriving just before departure time.
The boat we are traveling on has two floors and approximately twenty cabins, with common bathrooms, a kitchen and a small lounge, where meals, dinner and breakfast are taken.
The trip will be made at night through the region known as Jiangnan [South of the River], which crosses the lands south of the Changjiang (Yangzi River), in the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, from which the name of the canal built in the Qin dynasty in 85 km long and widened by 605. From Hangzhou it passes through the lands of Huzhou and Jiaxing and leaving the province of Zhejiang it enters the province of Jiangsu and skirting Lake Tai to the east, it follows to Suzhou, where our trip will end by boat.
From Hangzhou we left for Suzhou, in the comparison of the Venetian traveler Marco Polo, twin cities in terms of beauty, Paradises on Earth.
Night falls in Hangzhou when we cross the Gongzhen Bridge, built in 1631 entirely of stone with three arches and which keeps us awake on deck, despite it drizzling, as it begins the journey that has not yet been navigated. A passenger boat passes by carrying just one person, which is not surprising as the fog and drizzle throughout the afternoon takes away the pleasure of the trip.
The poplar trees lining the cobbled banks are suddenly lit by the red lanterns of an old-style waterfront restaurant waiting for customers. The beauty of the landscape is perhaps only due to the shadows at night.
Boat traffic is intense and all are cargo boats, some large, which can fit containers, others transporting sand, coal or wooden logs. The boat, with its flat hull and U-shaped bow, sails shallowly along the water's edge. At the stern of the vessel, at the top of the cabin, there are the signal lights, with the green one on the right side and the red one on the left. It uses an intense white beam of light to illuminate the channel in front and, when crossing paths with other vessels, it diverts it, or turns it off. Darkness wins. Before crossing other boats, some in the opposite direction, others to be overtaken, the searchlight comes on again for a few seconds to warn and visualize the size of the boats.
Next to a canal diversion, a diesel pump on the bank waits to refill fuel for anyone passing by. The waters carry Styrofoam debris and tree branches. From time to time, a factory on the banks has its pier taking advantage of this privileged transport route to receive raw materials and send production.
The width of the canal varies and sometimes allows four boats to pass at the same time, but in other places it is already tight for three.
We came across a convoy of boats pulled by a tug, where the workers' cabins were located, carrying ten long container boats. A light touch on our boat makes itself felt.
If during the first two hours of the trip the horn is constant, then it only lets out a shrill whistle sound when passing a group of houses and when it crosses the company boat in the opposite direction.
We fell asleep, but not before feeling another touch between boats and this time the blow was stronger.
We arrived at our destination early in the morning, after more than nine hours of sailing on the Grand Canal. At 5:30, the boat docked next to the Precious Belt Bridge (Baodai Qiao, 宝带桥) in the southeast part of Suzhou, in the Wuzhong district, but we only left at half past six. Two buses wait on Changqiao Street (长桥街道) to take passengers to the city center, six kilometers away.
Baodai Qiao is considered one of the most representative bridges in China and has this name because it was built between 816 and 819 at the expense of the sale of the valuable belt of Wang Zhongshu, governor of Suzhou in the Tang dynasty. With a length of 317 meters and 4.1 meters wide, it has 53 arches, having three openings is enough to allow boats to continue along the Grand Canal and also cross the Daidai River and Lake Tantai. The rest of the bridge serves as a pier, being at the level of the vessels that docked there and easily unloaded goods.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Paulo Maia and Carmo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Mi Fu (1051-1107), the unique Song dynasty calligrapher, poet and painter who cultivated strangeness in his personal life to abstain from the contamination of worldly affairs, ancient or modern paintings that he observed, wrote that these “things do not they touch or stir me when I sit cross-legged like a monk, forgetting all my problems and putting myself in harmony with the vast, blue void» (Huashi), would in the future be the object of an immense admiration.

“The European Union (EU) is very bad for us. They treat us very badly. They do not accept our cars or our agricultural products. In fact, they don’t accept much,” said the President of the United States, adding that, therefore, they will be targets of tariffs.
Questioned by the press at the White House, Trump also assured that his administration is discussing “10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, because they send [the opioid] fentanyl to Mexico and Canada”, which ends up being consumed in the United States. United.
“It’s probably February 1st,” added Donald Trump, the day that corresponds to the date announced the day before for the application of 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian products.
China reacted yesterday, saying it was “firmly determined” to “defend its national interests”.
“We have always believed that there are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war,” declared Mao Ning, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a press conference.
The President of the European Commission (EC), Ursula von der Leyen, who participated in the Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, guaranteed that Europe is ready to talk to the United States government, remembering that Washington is a important commercial partner.
Our first priority is to quickly start conversations about our common interests and be ready to negotiate”, he stated: “We will be pragmatic, but we will remain firm in our principles: defending our interests and respecting our values”, he stated the European leader.
“Europe will continue to defend cooperation, not only with our long-standing friends (…) but also with all countries with which we have common interests”, added von der Leyen.
“Our message to the rest of the world is simple: we are ready to dialogue with you, if this can lead to mutual benefits”, he added, ensuring that he intends to “deepen” relations between Brussels and Beijing.
Nothing new
During his presidential campaign, Trump had already denounced the United States' trade deficit in relation to the EU, comparing the bloc to “a little China” and accusing it of taking advantage of the world's leading economic power.
“We have a trade deficit with the EU of 350 billion dollars”, he insisted on Tuesday, noting that “China is aggressive, but it is not just China, other countries are also big aggressors”.
The US trade deficit with the EU will amount to $131 billion in 2023, according to data from the White House Trade Representative (USTR), and is mainly concentrated in four countries: Germany, France, Ireland and Italy.
Before being re-elected, Donald Trump had already threatened the EU with the imposition of customs duties on European products unless the bloc increased its purchases of American oil and gas.
The European Commissioner for the Economy, Valdis Dombrovskis, guaranteed on Monday, after Trump's inauguration, that the EU is “ready to defend its economic interests”, as it already did “during the first Trump administration, when it introduced tariffs on steel and aluminum.”</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:45:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Death / Rocha Vieira: Macau remembers last Portuguese Governor</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/obito-rocha-vieira-macau-recorda-ultimo-governador-portugues/</link><description>The last governor of Macau, Vasco Rocha Vieira, who died at the age of 85, laid the foundations for the success of the Chinese region and defended the rights of public servants, although with “some disagreements”, local leaders told Lusa. Vasco Rocha Vieira, former Army Chief of Staff between 1976 and 1978, died in the early hours of Monday at the age of 85, an official source from that military branch confirmed to Lusa.
“He is an illustrious figure, fundamental in the history of Macau's transition, but also, to a certain extent, in the present and future”, said José Sales Marques, president of Leal Senado, the former city council, between 1993 and 1999. “There is a lot something that was done during that period and that continues today. The bases of the Macau Special Administrative Region also have a lot to do with the work of Lieutenant General Rocha Vieira”, argued Sales Marques.
Rocha Vieira served as governor of Macau between 1991 and 1999, when the territory was transferred to China. It was during his mandate that the construction of the city's airport was completed.
The Macau that Rocha Vieira found and left “doesn’t compare. What was done in all those years is something that history has already recorded”, defended Sales Marques. also a member of the then Rocha Vieira Advisory Council.
Former deputy António Ng Kuok Cheong told Lusa that, despite the distrust of the Chinese, the administration “tried to do something to encourage the economic growth of the city, which was very poor at that time, before returning Macau”.
António Ng, elected to the Legislative Assembly five months after Rocha Vieira's appointment, highlighted that the main obstacle was China's resistance to the liberalization of the gaming sector, which would only end up being launched in 2002.
Something that forced the Portuguese administration to sell land to finance infrastructure projects, inadvertently planting the roots of the housing problem that Macau currently faces, he said.
“They tried to sell the land openly, but the Chinese government stopped them. So most of the land was sold to powerful people in China at a very low price because Macau's economy was very weak,” Ng recalled. A class of landlords was created who, after Macau became the world capital of casinos, became rich by controlling supply and keeping housing prices high, lamented the former deputy.
The work of public servants
Jorge Fão, one of the founders of the Macau Public Service Workers Association (ATFMP), in 1987, noted that Rocha Vieira “fulfilled his mission as governor” and “dignified his country”.
The former president of ATFPM, heading the association “for more than ten years”, reminded Lusa that he was “a trade unionist before being a politician” and “had some disagreements” with the lieutenant general.
Fão explained that he was “one of the protagonists” who worked so that, after Macau’s transition to China, “public servants [of the Portuguese administration] were entitled to a pension” paid by Portugal.
“No official from the other colonies had the right (…) When there was talk of discussing the handover of Macau to China, we were very worried. We launched our union struggles and had several meetings with the governance of Portugal and Macau (…). We had some meetings and in those meetings we also had disagreements”, he recalled.
In the end, summarized the current president of the General Assembly of the Association of Retirees, Retirees and Pensioners of Macau, “the outcome was not bad”. “Everyone must be satisfied, I too took part in this fight and have been living on this pension for over 30 years”, he argued.
At the time of administration, there were around 3,600 retirees with pensions transferred to Portugal, he concluded. In 2022, Jorge Fão told Lusa that he believed that around two thousand retirees from the former Portuguese administration of Macau lived in the Chinese region.
PS praises life “entirely dedicated to the service of Portugal”
The PS expressed regret at the death of the last Portuguese governor of Macau, praising a life “entirely dedicated to the service of Portugal” of a “prestigious soldier” and one of the “best interpreters of the importance of Macau”.
Through a statement, the party led by Pedro Nuno Santos mourns the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, “prestigious soldier and last Governor of Macau under Portuguese administration”.
“His life was entirely dedicated to the service of Portugal, both in his military career and in his political participation following the 25th of April, as a member of the Council of the Revolution (due to his duties as Chief of Staff of the Army), Minister of the Republic in the Azores, Deputy Secretary of the Government of Macau and Governor of Macau”, states the same note.
Noting that “his life was forever linked to Macau”, for the PS this “was one of the best interpreters of the importance” of that territory “for the relationship between Portugal and the People's Republic of China”, as well as the uniqueness of the now region special administrative.
“The last years of the Portuguese administration of the Territory of Macau, under the leadership of General Rocha Vieira, are marked by the completion of several important public infrastructure works to support the subsequent development of Macau, as well as administrative reforms to prepare it for the subsequent period”, he praises.
Socialists also refer to the ceremony transferring sovereignty from the Territory of Macau to the People's Republic of China, in which the way in which Rocha Vieira “personified and symbolized the dignity and tribute to the Portuguese presence in Macau for centuries” was undeniable.
“And it marked the friendship and respect that the Portuguese maintain with Macau and the People's Republic of China, and which allows, after 25 years of transition, to preserve the uniqueness of Macau, which continues to be a meeting point between cultures”, he added.
The PS thus gives “public note of its deep respect for services to the country” and “addresses its deepest condolences to his family and friends”.
Words by Eanes
The former President of the Republic Ramalho Eanes classified Rocha Vieira as “an exceptional man” and “one of the best” among the greatest figures in Portugal.
“General Rocha Vieira was an exceptional man for his excellent actions and assumed social responsibility, deserving to be, rightly, considered ‘one of the best of our greatest’”, wrote António Ramalho Eanes in a note sent to the Lusa agency.
The first elected head of state of Portuguese democracy remembers Vasco Rocha Vieira as “an extraordinary man”, especially “on three levels: for his distinctive personality, for his relevant military performance and for the services provided to the country at a political level”.
On a personal level, Eanes considers that Rocha Vieira, who died today at the age of 85, “possessed superior qualities of spirit”, had “exceptional intelligence”, “a good temperament” and “had a strong personality”.
At a military level, “he was one of the most distinguished soldiers of his generation, providing relevant services to the Army, in difficult times, namely, in the throes of the political regime prior to the 25th of April, during the 25th of April and, even, on the 25th of November, having also played an important role as a representative of the Portuguese Armed Forces within NATO”.
Regarding the political level, Eanes concludes that Rocha Vieira had an activity of “great quality and great importance for the country, whether as minister of the Republic for the Azores, or even as governor of Macau, putting all his commitment into the design and execution , successfully, in a policy of successful transformation of Macau, also participating, with the success that is known, in the transfer of the administration of the territory of Macau to the People's Republic of China”.
Souvenirs from the Azores
The president of the Azorean parliament, Luís Garcia, also expressed regret at the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, recalling his “exemplary dedication to the public cause” and his “invaluable contribution” to the country and the Azores.
“Throughout his notable military and political career, Rocha Vieira revealed an unshakable sense of State, exemplary dedication to the public cause and a deep patriotism, which indelibly marked his service to Portugal”, states Luís Garcia in a note of condolence.
The president of the Legislative Assembly of the Autonomous Region of the Azores (ALRAA) states that he learned of the death of the lieutenant general, a “unique figure and one of the most illustrious officers of the Portuguese Army”, with “deep consternation”.
According to the note, Luís Garcia “expresses his deepest condolences to the bereaved family, leaving a deep testimony of gratitude for their invaluable contribution to the country and the Azores”.
“As Minister of the Republic for the Autonomous Region of the Azores, between 1986 and 1991, Vasco Rocha Vieira performed his duties with high commitment, contributing significantly to the strengthening of institutional relations and the enhancement of regional autonomy”, he states.
The ALRAA leader also highlights that the period in which Rocha Vieira was at the service of the Azores “is remembered as a time of dedication to dialogue and the building of bridges between the bodies of national sovereignty and the Region's own government bodies”.
“He will also be remembered for the symbolism of his action as the last Governor of Macau, a position he held between 1991 and 1999, when he led the transfer of the Portuguese administration to the Chinese one, in an example of a sense of responsibility and loyalty to public service that will be recorded in the collective memory of Portugal”, he concluded.
Portuguese PM speaks out
The Prime Minister, Luís Montenegro, today remembered Rocha Vieira as “one of the most brilliant soldiers to embody the patriotic sense of being Portuguese”, highlighting his “historical and remarkable connection with Macau”.
Lieutenant General Vasco Rocha Vieira, the last Portuguese governor of Macau and former Chief of Staff of the Army, died this morning at the age of 85, an official source from that military branch confirmed to Lusa.
“General Vasco Rocha Vieira was one of the most brilliant soldiers to embody the patriotic sense of being Portuguese, with special services in consolidating our democracy and in the historic and remarkable connection to Macau, where he was the last governor”, ​​wrote Luís Montenegro, in a post on social network X.
The Prime Minister also offered his condolences to his family and friends and said he remembered Rocha Vieira's “gestures of kindness and words of civic and political responsibility”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Toponymy | Study links streets with Portuguese names to colonialism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/toponimia-estudo-relaciona-ruas-com-nomes-lusos-com-colonialismo/</link><description>In his master's thesis “Sino-Portuguese Culture in Macau – History in the Streets”, Zhao Zhen argues that the Portuguese Administration diluted “the national identity” of the Chinese population, by placing names referring to Portugal on the streets, namely writers, navigators, governors and public officials
 
Zhao Zhen, author of the master's thesis “Sino-Portuguese Culture in Macau – History in the Streets (Sino-Portuguese History and Culture from the perspective of street names in Macau)”, argues that the choice of street names with reference to Portugal during The years of Portuguese Administration were an effective form of colonization and creating a feeling of belonging to the colonizing nation, especially with regard to the Chinese community.
In the dissertation, defended at the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro (UTAD), it is concluded that “before the return of Macau to China, the Portuguese Government carried out a political and cultural practice through the attribution of street names to the Portuguese way”.
Thus, the names of streets in Macau served “as a means of transmitting a collective memory, starting with the construction of the image of the Portuguese Government in Macau and the orientation of its main values”, using “iconic historical figures and events to reinforce the identification of the colonized with their colonizing identity”.
Zhao Zhen further added that “during the 400 years of colonization of Macau by the Portuguese State, linguistic symbols were applied to the inhabitants of Macau through the naming of streets, diluting the traditional national identity of the Chinese and implementing that of the colonizers, thus achieving the objective of remodeling the national identity of local inhabitants”.
For the author of the study, the issue of the territory's very particular toponymy had consequences with regard to national identity. “The street names in Macau are different from those in other Chinese cities, and this has had an impact on the cultural identity of the local population, who grew up with Chinese and Portuguese history and culture and who do not have a strong sense of cultural identity. It thus dilutes its mission of transmitting its national culture.”
A form of dominance
It is true that Zhao Zhen's academic work, in the area of ​​Cultural Sciences, draws attention to the fact that Macau's toponymy is a reflection of a mixture of cultures. However, the author goes further, analyzing how many streets there are in Portuguese and Chinese named after important personalities, highlighting the fact that Portuguese culture is dominant.
The fact that there are streets in Macau named after Portuguese soldiers, former governors or politicians, such as Mário Soares, Sidónio Pais or Ramalho Eanes, is seen as synonymous with the fact that the Portuguese invested in “an effective process” of transmitting “a materialized vision of the world that influences and transmits social relations between people and different social classes”. Thus, what occurred was “an act that does not use violence as a form of forced control of the minds and conscience of the population”, in which “a means of coercion” was not applied.
Zhao Zhen states that “in total there are 26 streets named after Portuguese government officials in Macau who distinguished themselves for the contribution they made to the city, with no street named after a Chinese official in Macau”.
This shows “the distinction made by the Portuguese colonizers as a dominant class and the Chinese as a dominated class”, it is stated. However, the author emphasizes that “the Portuguese colonization of Macau was not an absolute aggression or domination”, as “the colonizers attempted to achieve leadership from a variety of perspectives, including ideological”, in which “the process of achieving this leadership it was interspersed with a more complex racial and cultural gray existence.”
According to the author, “the first systematic delimitation of streets and the establishment of names by the Portuguese Government of Macau was in 1869”, and many names were used with links to the Discoveries and the former Portuguese Empire.
Zhao Zhen gives the example of Rua de João de Almeida, which “is named after a general who stood out in the campaigns to assert colonial power in Angola, Africa, at the beginning of the 20th century”.
In total, there are 26 streets with references to the Discoveries and ancient Portuguese navigators, showing that “the [Portuguese] colonial administration used external political forces to indoctrinate the inhabitants of Macau with the intention of achieving leadership, guiding society through manipulation spiritual, moral and cultural”. Furthermore, the author considers that “a colonial vocabulary was used to create a sense of identity and subordination among the inhabitants, in order to achieve permanent colonization”.
Highlight is the existence of nine streets in Macau named after Macanese, such as Rua Francisco H. Fernandes, who was born in the territory on February 13, 1863, son of Portuguese parents, and who was a close friend of Sun Yat -sen, father of the Republican Revolution in China, in 1911.
The place of the Chinese
In the same dissertation it is read that, in contrast to the primacy of references to Portuguese culture and history, there are only 12 streets in Macau “named after Chinese”, the majority of which “were merchants from the peninsula and all had connections with the Portuguese government in the region”. In turn, “Dr. Sun Yat-sen Avenue is the only street named after a Chinese political figure”.
Citing another academic, surnamed Kuan, Zhao Zhen states that “in the case of names named after Chinese celebrities, in addition to being inferior in number, they were non-political figures”. “The Portuguese Government of Macau, when naming public roads, intentionally took political factors into account, wanting to convey the message that Macau was under Portuguese rule and that, politically speaking, it was a Portuguese colony”, said this same academic.
Highlight are two streets named after Macau's return to China, namely Avenida Doutor Henry Fok and Avenida Doutor Ma Man Kei. “These personalities were distinguished by their notable contributions to the reunification of Hong Kong and Macau and the development of China, so the attribution of the name of the street to these personalities reflects the influence of political factors after the end of Macau's long colonial history and smooth reunification with China. The addition of the word ‘doctor’ to their names shows even more respect for them,” it reads.
Also noteworthy is the existence of 140 streets in Macau whose names are translated phonetically from Chinese, highlighting Avenida de Ip Heng, Avenida de Lok Koi, Pátio de Iong Loc, Pátio Fu Van or Rua de San Lei. “All these words Chinese women express the people's desire for a better life and the search for quality of life. Other names are related to Chinese religion, such as Largo de Pao Cong Mio, Rua de Kun Iam Tong”, it is mentioned, without forgetting the 69 streets with names paraphrased in Chinese with links to Chinese beliefs.
“In order to live a better life and move it in the expected direction, the naming of streets reflects geographical elements, as well as people's hopes for their future lives. Street names are mentioned and used so often that people tend to give them good meanings to satisfy their own intentions of a better life. Influenced by traditional Chinese cultural concepts, many of the street names in Macau have auspicious and lucky meanings, with the words ‘Harmony, Tranquility, Friendship, Benevolence, Concord'.”
There are also streets whose names “show the desire of traders to have a prosperous business and to obtain all the profits that come from carrying out business”.
In general terms, Zhao Zhen concludes that “the Macau experience proves the possibility of harmonious coexistence of diverse communities and cultures”, with the toponymy “reflecting the coexistence and mixture of East and West, the harmony and difference between them, which today it is a mirror of the culture and fundamental values ​​of society”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:56:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Death | Rocha Vieira dies at age 85</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/obito-morreu-rocha-vieira-aos-85-anos/</link><description>Vasco Rocha Vieira, the last Portuguese Governor of Macau, died yesterday at the age of 85. The general had been ill for a long time. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa remembered him as “one of the most illustrious officers” of the Army, but, for Macau, Rocha Vieira goes down in history as the great worker behind the measures decided in the 1987 Joint Declaration
 
He had been ill for a long time, even missing some recent events in Lisbon about Macau and the transition. Vasco Rocha Vieira, general, former Chief of Staff of the Army, and last Portuguese Governor of Macau, died in the early hours of yesterday at the age of 85.
Born on August 16, 1939, he served as Governor of Macau between 1991 and 1999, when the territory was transferred to China. However, Rocha Vieira already had a connection to Macau, as he was in the territory after the 25th of April. Furthermore, he was also minister of the Republic of the Azores between 1986 and 1991.
One of the first personalities to react to his death, in Portugal, was the President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who expressed, in an official note, his “deep regret” for the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, remembering him as “one of the most distinguished officers” of the Army and praising their “marked patriotism”.
In a note published on the official website of the Presidency of the Republic on the Internet, the head of State remembers Rocha Vieira as “one of the most illustrious officers of the Portuguese Army in the transition to Democracy and in the first decades of its affirmation”. “Always closely linked to the Commands, he also held political functions such as Minister of the Republic for the Autonomous Region of the Azores”, is recalled in the note.
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa also highlights that Rocha Vieira was “very close to President António Ramalho Eanes”, having been “appointed Chancellor of the Ancient Military Orders” by him.
“The symbolism of the moment of transfer from Portuguese to Chinese administration will remain in the memory of many Portuguese as an example of a sense of State, a sense of service to the public cause and marked patriotism”, reads the note of condolence.
The President of the Republic, who claims to have followed “closely the last months” of Rocha Vieira’s life, “presents to his family, and, in particular, to his widow and children, the testimony of Portugal’s gratitude, with much missed friendship".
In his biography, entitled “To all the ports I arrived at”, he describes the moment when Mário Soares, then President of the Republic, said to Rocha Vieira: “I need you. Go to Macau and see if you can put that in order”, in reference to the Macau fax case, related to the construction of Macau International Airport, which gave so many headaches to his predecessor, Carlos Melancia, also now deceased.
The general then replied that he required nothing to go to Macau. “I didn’t ask him anything, nor did I put conditions on him. I went to Macau with the same spirit as I went to the Azores. It was not a political position inherent to a career. It was, in fact, a mission”, he describes himself.
It was then up to Rocha Vieira and his team to achieve all the objectives and ideals for the future of Macau present in the Joint Declaration that had been signed between Portugal and China in 1987. The Government led by Rocha Vieira saw the birth of the airport, built the entire bilingual legislative framework that is still in force today and built the Macau Cultural Center, inaugurated by Jorge Sampaio on March 19, 1999, among many other initiatives, including in the area of urbanism.
A “great friend”
Rocha Vieira, in fact, made the position available at the head of the Macau Executive when Jorge Sampaio was elected President of the Republic, at the turn of 1995 to 1996. “When I went to Macau I didn't know how things were going to go and how long it would take. stay there”, he recalled in his biography. However, despite Sampaio's initial hesitation in making a change, the truth is that Rocha Vieira ended up staying, as “his replacement would affect the regular sequence of the process” of transition, at a time when “the transition was already in sight. of the administration of the territory for China”, is described in “To all the Ports I arrived at”.
Speaking to RTP, Chito Rodrigues, a general who was acting governor of Macau, left words of condolence over the death of a friend.
“I remember him as a great friend and honorary member of the League of Combatants. He has always had a relationship with us and is a reference for us. We knew it was bad and we were, in a way, not surprised [with the news of death], but it is always an unpleasant surprise.”
Chito Rodrigues remembers him during his duties in Macau as someone who contributed “to making Macau a peaceful place so that decolonization could be carried out in an ‘exemplary’ way”. “I was with him at the opening of the airport and had close relations with him as Governor. He was someone who replaced his predecessors with success and humility, restoring the tradition of military Governors in Macau”, he added.
In the book “Macau between two worlds”, by Fernando Lima and Eduardo Cintra Torres, the former Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, remembered Rocha Vieira as “a courageous and judicious man, with enormous integrity and an excellent servant of his country”. “I think Portugal was very lucky to have such a good man as its last Governor, in such a difficult place”, he pointed out.
The controversies
Rocha Vieira's name was, however, involved in some controversies, namely with the creation of the Fundação Jorge Álvares and Fundação Oriente, especially regarding the funds allocated to these two entities. “The bulk of public opinion in the territory and the Beijing authorities contested the legitimacy of a contract under which an entity based in Lisbon was fed with resources generated in Macau”, reads Rocha Vieira’s biography. He only intended for the foundation to “play a useful role for Macau”, and the controversy was diluted over time.
On social media, the journalist and former director of Macau Hoje, João Severino said he “really regrets” the disappearance of Rocha Vieira. “General Vasco Rocha Vieira left us after several weeks in hospital. The last Governor of Macau was a good man to many people and discriminatory to many. In any case, his military career was exemplary and left a mark on the Macau administration. I maintained some controversial moments with the illustrious Governor, always with the greatest cordiality and consideration for the highest representative of my country in Macau. I present to your wife dr. My condolences to Leonor and her children and may she rest in peace”, he wrote.
An entity that reacted to Rocha Vieira's disappearance was the Luso-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCILC), which on social media released a note of condolence about the death of the 138th Portuguese Governor of Macau and who presided over the CCILC strategic council.
“General Rocha Vieira played a remarkable and exemplary role throughout his life, standing out for his commitment to service to the nation, his dedication to relations between Portugal and China, and his historic role in closing the administration cycle Portuguese in Macau.”
The same note also states that “in leading the CCILC strategic council, his strategic vision, wisdom and human values ​​were always a source of inspiration for the entire Board and executive team”.
The Lisbon City Council also officially reacted to his disappearance. “Rocha Vieira dedicated his life to defending the national interest, notably serving Portugal as Chief of Staff of the Army and as the last Governor of Macau. A visionary statesman, he ensured a peaceful transfer of Macau's sovereignty to China. A man of courage, he contributed to the consolidation of the democratic process, being a fundamental part of the 25th of November 1975. It was an honor to have his testimony at the first ceremony to commemorate the 25th of November in the Town Hall, in 2023.”
Farewell to Macau
The images of Rocha Vieira holding the Portuguese flag to his chest on December 19, 1999, with his face visibly moved, are famous, as if saying goodbye to the “mission” he agreed to carry out in Macau.
After his role as Governor ended, Rocha Vieira maintained close ties with the territory, and the last time he was in Macau was in 2023, to receive the honorary doctorate from the Macau University of Science and Technology.
There, he highlighted that the “good historical relations” with China are “an asset for Portugal” and that today the country is “an emerging superpower”. The general said that “another great asset” for Portugal is China's interest in the Portuguese language, highlighting the growing number of Chinese universities that teach Portuguese. At the end of 2020, the Coordinator of the Pedagogical and Scientific Center for the Portuguese Language at the Macau Polytechnic University, Gaspar Zhang Yunfeng, said that there were around 50 higher education institutions offering Portuguese courses in mainland China.
“China is interested in Portuguese developing (…) also to be able to have, through Portugal, a closer relationship with Portuguese-speaking countries”, highlighted Rocha Vieira.
In a last interview given to the Lusa agency, in 2019, Rocha Vieira recalled the times in Macau and its vicissitudes, especially regarding the transition process.
“I had more problems with the Portuguese side than with the Chinese side (…) many times, due to a lack of perception. Normally, people are far away, in Lisbon – this is a historical thing, which is not just for now – and they think they know the solutions better than those in Macau”, he stated.
Rocha Vieira assured that, when it was necessary to define “the direction, the fundamental objectives of the policies for Macau, they were discussed by the Government of Macau, in Lisbon, with whom they should be discussed, with the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister”, there was “always” about this “a great understanding on the part of the Portuguese sovereign bodies and a great proof of trust in relation to those who were in the territory”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:26:24</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Trump takes office and throws barbs at China over Panama Canal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/eua-trump-toma-posse-e-lanca-farpas-a-china-sobre-canal-do-panama/</link><description>The new North American President, Donald Trump, promised this Monday to take control of the Panama Canal, rename the Gulf of Mexico and reinforce taxation on foreign countries, confirming intentions already expressed for his second term in the White House.
In his speech at the inauguration ceremony as the 47th President of the United States, Donald Trump highlighted that the objective of the agreement and the spirit of the treaty in relation to the Panama Canal “have been completely violated”, promising to take control of this vital maritime infrastructure for global trade.
“And most importantly, China operates the Panama Canal, and we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we’re going to take it back”, he explained in his speech held at the Capitol (headquarters of the North American Congress), in Washington.
In another previously expressed intention, Trump also confirmed that he will soon change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America”.
More taxes
Upon his return to the White House (North American presidency), after a first term between 2017 and 2021, the Republican politician also stated that he intends to reinforce taxation in foreign countries in favor of North American citizens.
“I will immediately begin reforming our trade system to protect American families and workers. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will impose tariffs and taxes on foreign countries to enrich our citizens”, he declared.
Expel illegals
Donald Trump also guaranteed that he will expel “millions and millions” of illegal immigrants, one of the main focuses of his election campaign. “First, I will declare a state of emergency on our southern border” with Mexico, said the President, adding that he will send the Army to patrol that region.

The non-governmental organization suggests measures that promote equality and warns of the risks of concentration of wealth and power
 
It’s called “Takers not Makers – The unjust poverty and unearned wealth of colonialism” and is the most recent report from Oxfam, a non-governmental organization (NGO). ) which brings together 19 countries. The document draws attention to poverty in the world and inequalities in the distribution of wealth.
The report released yesterday concludes that inequality shows no signs of slowing down. This is because, last year, the combined wealth of billionaires, globally, increased by two billion dollars, equivalent to 5.7 billion dollars per day, according to Oxfam.
This means that it grew at a rate three times higher than the previous year, according to the NGO.
This was the main conclusion of the report released yesterday on the occasion of the start of the Davos World Economic Forum, which every year brings together the world's main political and economic leaders in the Alpine city.
In the last year alone, the report states, an average of almost four new billionaires emerged per week, which Oxfam contrasts with poverty data from the World Bank, which estimates that the number of people living on less than 6.85 dollars per day has barely changed since 1990.
In 2024, there were 2,769 billionaires around the world, instead of 2,565 in the previous year, and their combined wealth increased from 13 to 15 billion dollars in just 12 months. It is the second largest increase in the combined wealth of billionaires in a single year on record.
Another 100 million
The combined wealth of the ten richest men in the world increased, on average, by almost 100 million dollars per day, the study indicates. Even if they lost 99 percent of their wealth overnight, “they would still be multimillionaires.”
The NGO predicts that, in less than a decade, the first “billionaire” on the planet will emerge and does not exclude the possibility of there being at least five. At a global level, the report reveals that 36 percent of the wealth of the richest is inherited and 61 percent is also marked by clientelism and/or linked to monopoly power.
Oxfam is based on data from Forbes magazine's wealth ranking, which shows that all billionaires under the age of 30 inherited their wealth and, according to data from the Swiss bank UBS, over the next 20 to 30 years, a thousand of those Current multimillionaires will leave their heirs more than 5.2 billion dollars.
Southern Money
For Oxfam, the system “causes large flows of money to move from the global South to the North, benefiting the richest population”, in a kind of “modern colonialism”.
In 2023 alone, through the financial system, 30 million dollars per hour will have been withdrawn from countries in the global South to the richest 1 percent of countries in the global North, such as the United Kingdom, the United States and France.
In this way, the “super-rich” from the countries of the global North control 69 percent of the world's wealth, concentrate 77 percent of the combined wealth of all billionaires and represent around 68 percent of the total, although they constitute only 21 percent of the world population.To contextualize this inequality, Oxfam refers to the housing problem in Spain and estimates that “the five future billionaires on the planet will have so much money that they will be able to buy all the houses in the country”.
In contrast, attention is drawn to the fact that the “working class struggles to survive.” “Those living in poverty around the world continue to face multiple crises, as the scars of the pandemic are still with us in the form of unpayable debts, lower wages and much higher food prices.”
Furthermore, “conflicts are also on the rise, which contributes to poverty, hunger and inequality”, without forgetting “the enormous human impact of climate degradation that increases every year, with deaths caused by excessive heat, extreme weather conditions and hunger".
Oxfam even says that Donald Trump's re-election as President of the United States last November “gave a huge boost to billionaires' fortunes, while his policies are poised to further fan the flames of inequality”.
The NGO also highlights data from the World Bank in its most recent report on poverty, which states that “if current growth rates are maintained and inequality does not decrease, it will take more than a century to end poverty”. The document shows that “if we reduce inequality, poverty could be eliminated three times faster”.
One of the highlights is the contribution of women to the wealth of a few. “Racialized women living in poverty, especially those in the ‘Global South,’ continue to subsidize the global economy. It is estimated that every day women contribute 12.5 billion hours of unpaid work, adding at least $10.8 trillion in value to the global economy.” In this context, “the economic contribution of their care work is three times greater than the financial value of the global technology industry”.
A new colonialism
It is true that the decolonization of regions colonized by European powers began to occur more strongly after the Bandung Conference in 1955, but signs of power imbalance between people and countries persist, which explain, in part, the wealth inequality that occurs. today.
The idea of ​​a new colonialism, in the sense that regions such as Europe or North America continue to exploit countries in the South, especially the less developed ones, is clearly evident in the Oxfam report. “The rise of a new oligarchy in which inheritance, clientelism and monopoly power generate extreme wealth. Without control, we are about to see the greatest transfer of the greatest generational wealth in the history of humanity, hard earned, hard taxed.”
What is happening today is a panorama of “billionaire colonialism”, describes Oxfam, with “the transfer of wealth not only to the ultra-rich, but disproportionately to the ultra-rich in the Global North”. There is a “reckoning with colonialism not only as a history of brutal wealth extraction, but also as a powerful force driving extreme levels of inequality today.”
Oxfam also draws attention to a new wave of colonialism evident in the actions of large economic and financial institutions that decide the direction of the global economy, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank. “Global institutions, financial markets and multinational corporations, all shaped by colonialism and the rule of rich countries, continue to facilitate the south-north transfer of trillions of dollars every year.”
For Oxfam, the UN, IMF and World Bank “were created 80 years ago, close to the end of the historical colonial period, and their unequal governance has changed little since then”.
“The G7 countries continue to hold 41 percent of the votes at the IMF and World Bank, despite having less than ten percent of the world's population. The leaders of the World Bank and IMF continue to be decided by the United States and Europe, respectively. Likewise, European countries and other nations in the Global North hold 47 percent of the total seats on the UN Security Council, despite representing only 17 percent of the world's population.”
It should be noted that “the IMF and the World Bank continue to have an enormous influence on the global economic system and, in particular, on the economic policies of low and middle-low income countries”. These entities, according to Oxfam, “systematically insist on implementing cuts in critical expenses”.
One of the examples presented is from the IMF, which “requires debtor countries to prioritize paying debts to creditors above all else and to implement policies that include privatization, trade liberalization and reduction of public deficits to obtain new loans”. “These policies undermine access to quality and affordable education and healthcare, with a negative impact on public health”, it adds.
What to do?
Oxfam proposes a series of measures to mitigate the growing inequality between the richest and the rest of the planet, suggesting, among others, that Governments commit to ensuring that the income of the richest ten percent of the population does not exceed that of the 40 percent poorest, both nationally and globally.
The report also calls for an increase in taxes on large fortunes, through an international tax system designed by the UN, and the elimination of tax havens.

The list includes other companies with flights to Macau, namely AirAsia, in sixth place, and JetStar , from Singapore, in second place
 
Last week, the new edition of the ranking of the safest airlines in the world by Airline Ratings was released. And the highlight, in the field of low-cost companies, goes to Hong Kong Express, with the organizers of the list explaining that “compared to last year's list there were no significant changes”. HK Express “has not had any serious incidents and maintains a relatively impeccable safety record”, it is further stated.
Citing OAG, a global platform that provides travel data, Airline Ratings highlights, in another note dated January 7, that HK Express, a subsidiary of Cathay Pacific, “expanded its operations significantly last year”, increasing the number of flights by 46 percent, “going from 23,940 flights in 2023 to 35,015 in 2024”, thanks “to an expanded network and additional capacity fleet.”
HK Express' growth appears to be in line, also according to OAG, with the “comprehensive recovery of Cathay Pacific Group, which has fully restored its operations to pre-pandemic levels”, currently having flights to 30 destinations across Asia, including China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines.
Still in the top 10 of the safest in the world, and at the lowest prices, are JetStar, from Singapore, and AirAsia in sixth place, the latter with a large offer of flights to and from Macau International Airport, particularly to cities and regions of Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Kota Kinabalu, in Malaysia; Bangkok and Chiang Mai, in Thailand; Manila, capital of the Philippines, and also Jakarta and Bali, in Indonesia. In eighth place we find VietJet Air, and Cebu Pacific in 22nd place, just to give a few examples.
In the case of European airlines, Ryanair is in third place in terms of safety, followed by EasyJet in fourth place. The organizers also highlight new entries to the ranking of the safest low-cost airlines in the world, such as Zipair, Jet2 and Air Baltic. On the contrary, there is “a notable omission, this year, with Spirit Airlines”, which went bankrupt in November 2024, “to restructure its finances and reduce debt”.
Air New Zealand in 1st
Regarding airlines operating in the scheduled market, the safest is Air New Zealand, followed by Qantas. Hong Kong scores points again for occupying third place with Cathay Pacific, a place shared with Emirates, from Dubai; and Qatar Airways. From Asia, there are also companies such as EVA Air, from Taiwan, in fourth place; and Korean Air, in fifth. The Portuguese TAP Portugal comes in eighth place.
Sharon Peterson, CEO of Arline Ratings, highlighted that “Air New Zealand and Qantas are back in contention for first place with just 1.50 points difference”. “While both airlines maintain the highest safety and pilot training standards, Air New Zealand continues to have a younger fleet than Qantas, which separates the two,” he added.
This year's edition of the rating highlights the solidified position of Vietnam Airlines, which was considered the 22nd safest to travel in the world and which stood out in recent awards from Airline Ratings. “Vietnam Airlines has not had any fatal accidents in 27 years, nor any serious incidents. The airline operates a fleet of 100 modern aircraft, with an average age of less than 10 years, and the company has flawlessly passed its IOSA certification since 2006. Furthermore, Vietnam has also made great progress in aviation safety with better airports , navigation system updates and much stricter protocols. All of this, together, guarantees them a place in our top 25”, said Sharon Peterson.
United Airlines comes in 23rd place on the list of safest scheduled airlines, almost at the bottom. In the case of the low-cost segment, Air Baltic occupies the last position, making the company's debut in the ranking.
Departing Singapore Airlines
Still regarding the top places, Sharon Peterson highlighted that “the three-way tie for third place was due to the fact that we simply could not separate these airlines”, this is because “from the age of the fleet to the skills of the pilots, safety, fleet size and number of incidents, the scores were identical”, he said.
The CEO also made a comparison with the 2024 list, and “some of the most significant changes include the inclusion of Iberia and Vietnam Airlines (which made their debut on the list), as well as the rise of Korean Air to the top 10 ”.
Regarding absences, this refers to the departure of Singapore Airlines and KLM. “Although these airlines continue to be exceptionally safe and maintain their seven-star safety rating, they narrowly lost one place this year due to incidents that occurred,” he said in the same note.
The criteria used by Airline Ratings relate to the occurrence of “serious incidents in the last two years”, the age and size of the fleet, the accident rate, the number of deaths, the training and skills of pilots and other international certifications held. by the company. One of the factors to take into account when evaluating companies is also the way accidents are managed.
A recent study on aviation safety highlights that between 2018 and 2022 the risk of deaths from flying was one in 13.7 million, and, in comparison, “the World Health Organization estimated 1.19 million deaths from road accidents in 2023, which represents more than two deaths per minute.”
Recent trauma
One of the most recent plane crashes occurred in South Korea, practically at the end of last year. A Jeju Air flight had a serious landing accident at Muan Airport, leading to the death of 179 of the 181 people on board. The two survivors were crew members on the flight.
Airline Ratings was created in 2012, analyzing more than 230 airlines from around the world that cover 99 percent of the global passenger market. Outside the top 25 are Chinese airlines, including Air Macau.</description><pubDate>2025-01-20 05:41:19</pubDate></item><item><title>CAEAL | Chief of Executive received delegation to monitor elections</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/caeal-chefe-do-executivo-recebeu-delegacao-para-acompanhar-eleicoes/</link><description>The Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, received a delegation from the Electoral Affairs Committee of the Legislative Assembly to attend a presentation on the preparation of elections for future deputies.

In a speech before the Portuguese consul and Forum Macau delegates, Sam Hou Fai highlighted the importance of the guidelines proposed by Xi Jinping during his visit to Macau
 
Macau and Portuguese-speaking countries must strengthen business cooperation. This was one of the main highlights of the Chief Executive's speech at the reception dinner for the consuls general in Macau and the delegates from Portuguese-speaking countries at Forum Macau.
Sam Hou Fai called for the improvement of “various exchange and cooperation mechanisms” between Macau and Portuguese-speaking markets, to “comprehensively leverage exchange and cooperation at the private sector level”.
“Delegations arriving from your countries to visit Macau will always be warmly welcomed”, guaranteed the Government leader. Sam promised to support the travel of Portuguese-speaking delegations to mainland China, including the Deep Cooperation Zone between Guangdong and Macau, in Hengqin, and the Guangdong-Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area.
Sam defended the need for “pragmatic cooperation (…) in different areas” and highlighted the importance of Forum Macau’s new action plan until 2027.
In addition to the connection with Portuguese-speaking countries, the leader of the Macao SAR Government pointed to cooperation between Macau and Southeast Asian countries.
Highlighting the friendly relationship between Macau and Portuguese-speaking countries and that the Macao SAR is the only region in the world that has Chinese and Portuguese as its official languages, Sam Hou Fai stressed the need to “boost joint development characterized by equality, cooperation and mutual benefits , comprehensively raising the level of Sino-Lusophone cooperation”.
Close friends
In a speech marked by multiple references to the “important speeches” of President Xi Jinping, which Sam Hou Fai points out as the key to opening a new phase of governance in the Macao SAR, the leader of the Executive says that “a new scenario of exchange and cooperation has been created ” between Portuguese-speaking and Southeast Asian countries, China and the Macao SAR.
Regarding Southeast Asia, Sam Hou Fai highlighted the Philippines. “The MSAR and the countries of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, which are geographically close, have close economic and commercial cooperation, with intense exchange of people and in the cultural area, being traditionally good neighbors and good partners.”
The official highlighted the “valuable contributions to the socio-economic development of Macau” of the Filipino community, which, according to the 2021 Census, corresponded to around 5 percent of the total population of Macau, being the second largest community in the Region after to the Chinese community.”
“This good basis of traditional cooperation”, as Sam Hou Fai categorized it, is a factor to be taken advantage of to “seize new opportunities, explore more potential for cooperation in all aspects”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:22:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Continental Affairs Council warns of “possible risks” in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/conselho-de-assuntos-continentais-avisa-para-possiveis-riscos-em-macau/</link><description>Taiwan has advised people not to travel to Hong Kong or Macau during the Lunar New Year period, due to “possible security risks”. Taiwan's Continental Affairs Council (MAC) recalled that the travel alert for the two territories remains at “orange level”, the second highest level.
The body responsible for relations with China justifies the warning “taking into account changes to the situation in Hong Kong and Macau and in response to local laws and regulations and law enforcement methods”. “Citizens are advised to avoid non-essential travel” to the two cities, including in transit, due to “possible risks to safety and individual rights”, added the MAC, in a statement.
Lunar New Year is the main festival for Chinese families, equivalent to Christmas in Western countries, and this year in Taiwan includes a period of nine days of holidays between January 25th and February 2nd.
The MAC advised the population to register, in advance, in a database created for Taiwanese traveling to the Interior, Hong Kong or Macau and recalled that there are hotlines to support citizens.
Records rising
Although not mandatory, the number of Taiwanese who registered to travel to Chinese territory between January and October 2024 increased by around 14 times compared to the previous year, according to data released by the organization in December.
Registrations for Hong Kong and Macau “exceeded five times the total for the same period last year”, said the MAC.
China “continued to adopt and change national security laws, which led to several incidents, involving the arbitrary detention, arrest and interrogation of Taiwanese citizens in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau”, said the organization.
In September, the MAC said that a director of the Taiwanese conglomerate Formosa Plastics had been under “border control” for 18 days, a type of measure that prevents him from leaving the country.
Taiwan raised its travel alert level in mid-June and advised the population to avoid China, Hong Kong and Macau, after Beijing threatened to execute people considered “staunch defenders” of Taiwanese independence.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Financial reserve | Close to the best annual record since the pandemic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/reserva-financeira-perto-do-melhor-registo-anual-desde-pandemia/</link><description>After the years of the pandemic, the Macao SAR's financial reserve is close to recording its best year, with gains of 37.5 billion patacas in the first 11 months of the year
 
Macau's financial reserve is close to recording its best year since the pandemic, after earning 37.5 billion patacas in the first 11 months of 2024, it was announced yesterday. According to data from the Macau Monetary Authority (AMCM), this could be the highest annual increase since 2019, when the value of the reserve increased by 70.6 billion patacas.
The Macao SAR's financial reserve gained 22.2 billion patacas in 2023, after having lost almost four times that amount in the previous year.
The value of the reserve amounted to almost 618 billion patacas at the end of November, the highest value since March 2022, according to data published in the Official Bulletin. Still, the value remains far from the record of 663.6 billion patacas reached in February 2021, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The territory's financial reserve gained 4.63 billion patacas in November, compared to October, the month in which it suffered the second drop in 2024.
The value of the extraordinary reserve at the end of November was 431.9 billion patacas and the basic reserve, equivalent to 150 percent of Macau's public budget for this year, was 153.4 billion patacas.
Budget forecast surplus
The budget for 2024 predicted a 1.4 percent increase in total expenditure, to 105.9 billion patacas. The financial reserve is mainly made up of deposits and current accounts worth 243.2 billion patacas, credit securities worth 121.6 billion patacas and up to 247.1 billion patacas in subcontracted investments.
In January 2024, AMCM highlighted that the investments yielded almost 29 billion patacas to the financial reserve in 2023, corresponding to a profitability rate of 5.2 percent.
This is despite the fact that, in 2023, the region's authorities transferred almost 10.4 billion patacas from the financial reserve to the public budget.
Macau's budget for 2024 predicted the return of surpluses in public accounts, anticipating a positive balance of 1.17 billion patacas, without “the need to resort to the financial reserve”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:17:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Obligations | Direct link created with Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/obrigacoes-criada-ligacao-directa-com-hong-kong/</link><description>The Macau Monetary and Exchange Authority (AMCM) joined its counterpart Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to create a service connecting Macau to the neighboring region's stock exchange.

Sam Hou Fai also wants to update the minimum wage regime
 
Sam Hou Fai promises that the Government will review workers' holidays and update the “minimum wage regime”. The promise was made on Monday night, during a speech at the celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau (FAOM).
“We will continue to improve legal diplomas in the labor sphere, timely improve matters related to workers' holidays, as well as dynamically update the minimum wage regime”, promised the Chief Executive, in front of members of the traditional association .
However, the Chief Executive avoided any temporal commitment to change the number of holidays or the minimum wage, limiting himself to using the expression “in a timely manner”. The wording of the speech is also far from guaranteeing that there will be an increase in the number of holidays, which is currently six, or even the minimum wage.
Sam also promised that he will guarantee the population's basic living conditions, in what was the first of six promises made at the time. “Firstly, we will ensure the basic conditions for the well-being of the population, making more efforts to promote the gradual inclination of social benefits so that they benefit more low-income groups, the most vulnerable and needy”, he highlighted.
Among the priority work, the government official also highlighted what he stated were the “issues that concern society most”, and committed to “constantly increasing the feeling of fulfillment, happiness and security”.
Represented with four deputies in the Legislative Assembly, FAOM is traditionally closer to the territory's workers. To these too, Sam Hou Fai promised better conditions in the future. “We will safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of workers, dedicate ourselves to creating stability and diversity in access to employment and continue to improve the environment for access to employment,” he said.
Access to employment
The Chief Executive indicated that the current policy involves guaranteeing priority access for residents to jobs. “We will guarantee the priority of local workers in access to employment and improve the mechanism of dynamic adjustment and positive complementarity between guaranteeing the employment of local workers and the importation of non-resident workers”, he assured.
In addition to promising more training and employment opportunities for young people, the Government leader indicated that he will contribute to ensuring that labor relations remain harmonious. “We will improve the communication and coordination mechanism in the workplace, promoting the creation of harmonious and friendly labor relations”, he stressed.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 00:06:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Hengqin | Nick Lei calls for flexible rules for non-permanent BIR</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/hengqin-nick-lei-pede-regras-flexiveis-para-bir-nao-permanentes/</link><description>The issue of BIRs and Macau's integration into the Hengqin Deep Cooperation Zone needs to be expedited. The idea was defended, in a written interpellation, by deputy Nick Lei. The legislator asked the Government for flexibility in regulations, allowing non-permanent residents who live in Hengqin some peace of mind regarding the obligation to remain in Macau long enough to renew their BIR.
Remember that legislation requires you to stay in Macau for at least 183 days per year. The requirement is seen by Nick Lei as an obstacle to the integration of Hengqin and Macau.
Nick Lei also wants the Government to collaborate with authorities in Mainland China to install exclusive automatic passage channels for students and residents of Macau at the Hengqin Border Post.
The deputy linked to the Fujian community recalled that the Government had made a commitment to improve cross-border corridors for students, but that these specific facilities only operate until 6pm, not meeting the needs of students and their families.
Also the lack of shelter on rainy days and the poor lighting at night in the passenger area at the Hengqin Border Post for vehicles to pass through were criticized by Nick Lei, who warned of the danger of falls.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 00:04:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Geogastronomy and Macau UNESCO Creative City in Gastronomy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/a-geogastronomia-e-macau-cidade-criativa-em-gastronomia-da-unesco/</link><description>“Geogastronomy offers an innovative lens through the exploration of the deep-rooted cultural connections between food, landscape and people. The synergy of the mix and match from different areas creates a magical creativity to outstand the taste of memories which seated as the greatest piece of a region. As part of the UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy in Macao, Lisboeta Macau aims to bring together the tradition and innovation of food and fun places to foster the global appreciation of Macao.”
Dr. Christine Hong Barbosa.
Vice President of Marketing &amp; Retail Development of Lisbon
Geogastronomy is a term that merges geography and gastronomy, emphasizing the relationship between food culture and its geographic roots. This concept highlights how local ingredients, cooking methods and cultural influences converge to shape regional cuisines. By examining local cuisine, researchers and enthusiasts can gain insight into a community's history, culture and identity. Geogastronomy thus serves as a bridge that connects culinary practices to environmental and sociopolitical contexts.
Macau, located on the southern coast of China, is a distinctive example of geogastronomy in action. Its position as a historic trading port and melting pot of cultures provides a unique setting for its culinary evolution. The intricate mix of Portuguese and Chinese influences in Macanese cuisine shows how geography can influence food culture, leading to a diverse range of flavors, ingredients and cooking techniques. Macau's food scene is a vibrant tapestry woven from various cultural threads, particularly those of Chinese and Portuguese origin. The city has iconic dishes such as Macanese curry, cod and authentic custard tarts (which cannot be confused with the egg tarts that fill the streets and in due time we will reveal how this phenomenon came about), each one reflecting its influences. unique histories.
The fusion of spices, aromatic herbs and cooking styles creates a distinct gastronomic identity. The use of seasonal and locally sourced ingredients highlights Macau's connection to its geographic environment, reinforcing the principles of geogastronomy. The historical context of Macau's gastronomy is remarkable. Portuguese colonization introduced new ingredients and culinary techniques that became part of Chinese food traditions. This cultural exchange resulted in a rich variety of dishes that combine the best of both worlds. For example, the use of cumin, curry powder and coconut milk reflects Portuguese culinary practices, while techniques such as wok frying signify traditional Chinese cooking methods.
As a result, Macau cuisine has developed into a sophisticated blend, rather than being a mere amalgam of the cultures that influence it. Several influential personalities play a crucial role in shaping Macau's culinary scene. Notable chefs and restaurateurs have dedicated their efforts to preserving and innovating Macanese cuisine. Renowned Chefs António Neves Coelho and José Avillez are known for modernizing traditional Portuguese dishes while maintaining their authenticity. His approach serves as an example of how chefs can honor their culinary heritage while adapting to contemporary trends. They emphasize the use of local ingredients and the appreciation of traditional recipes. Through their initiatives, they promote the concept of geogastronomy as a method to preserve culinary heritage.
Their work exemplifies the vital role that chefs and culinary professionals play within the creative city. The designation of “Macau as a UNESCO Creative City in Gastronomy” in 2017 further highlights the importance of culinary innovation and heritage. This recognition emphasizes the city's commitment to maintaining and promoting its rich culinary history while promoting a sustainable future. The program encourages collaboration between local chefs, artisans and academics, promoting a gastronomic culture that reflects Macau's mixed identity. The designation of “Macau as a UNESCO Creative City in Gastronomy” had a far-reaching impact on several facets of Macanese society, namely tourism and local economies that slowed down during the Covid-19 pandemic and are beginning to revive.
Lisboeta Macau, for example, has made a notable contribution with its official vision being “to be a Macau-themed tourist destination that combines iconic landmarks from its collective memory with the unique Sino-Portuguese culture to promote its unique cultural identity . Lisboeta Macau proudly aligns with the vision of Macau as a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy. Macau's rich cultural history, which combines Portuguese and Chinese influences, creates a unique and dynamic gastronomic landscape. Lisbonite Macau believes that this recognition as a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy not only celebrates the fusion of flavors and traditions, but also highlights the importance of preserving and innovating local food heritage. With a strong commitment to preserving Macanese heritage and promoting innovative culinary experiences, Lisboeta Macau takes advantage of the company's strengths to promote Macanese-Portuguese culture, supporting cross-border integration “Turismo+Gastronomia” through collaboration with the famous Chef Portuguese António Coelho at “Angela's Café and Lounge”, highlighting the fusion of Macau's Portuguese-Chinese heritage with traditional Portuguese cuisine, combining culinary techniques Portuguese classics with innovative creations to offer citizens and visitors a memorable gastronomic experience and contributing to Macau's growing reputation as a vibrant gastronomic hub, in line with its economic development, attracting food enthusiasts, tourists and industry professionals”.
“Lisboeta Macau is committed to supporting the Macao SAR Government's strategy of promoting the tourism industry, consistently driving local economic growth through innovation and cross-border integration. Lisbon Macau's LINE FRIENDS themed restaurant “BROWN &amp; FRIENDS CAFE &amp; BISTRO” and Shanghai's famous crab brand “CEJERDARY” joined the 24th Macau Gastronomic Festival, introducing diverse local flavors to global tourists and highlighting the Macau's dynamic strengths as a vibrant platform as a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy. Furthermore, Lisboeta Macau intends to take advantage of the synergies of the “Macao Outdoor Show Space” to present the “LISBOETA NIGHT-the Night Market with More Macau People”, stimulating the economic development of the community and immersing visitors in a distinct mix of traditional culture and modern innovation, showing the essence of Macanese and Portuguese-inspired culture, further strengthening Macau's night-time economy. These collaborations help reinforce Macau’s position as a creative city that values ​​both culinary tradition and innovation, ensuring the long-term sustainability of its gastronomic scene, while promoting economic growth and cultural exchange.”
This distinction has positioned Macau as a global gastronomic destination, attracting food enthusiasts and tourists eager to experience its unique culinary offerings. The tourism sector benefited significantly from this designation. With the increase in international interest in Macau's cuisine, several festivals and gastronomic events have been organized to showcase local dishes. These events not only celebrate gastronomic culture, but also offer entrepreneurs and companies platforms to showcase their products. This increase in tourism translates into an increase in economic opportunities for local inhabitants, including the creation of jobs in the hotel, restaurant and homemade food production sectors or almost, despite the crisis that Macau is experiencing with the low purchasing power of residents who decreased to the detriment of the Mainland and the tourists from there, which it also reduced, for the same reasons.
Furthermore, the UNESCO designation leads the government to sponsor initiatives aimed at supporting sustainable practices in the gastronomy sector. Programs that encourage zero-waste cooking demonstrate a commitment to sustainability and community involvement. This paradigm shift reflects a growing awareness of the interconnections between gastronomy, environmental management and social responsibility. Culinary education is another critical aspect of Macau’s culinary narrative. The educational institutions and culinary schools that must be created urgently, not just reserved for the University of Tourism, will play a fundamental role in training the next generation of chefs and culinary professionals. By integrating traditional Macanese cuisine into their curricula, these institutions encourage the appreciation of local gastronomic culture among students.
This educational approach also encourages innovation, as young chefs experiment with their heritage, breathing new life into traditional recipes. Cultural preservation is fundamental to maintaining Macau's rich culinary history. Initiatives aimed at documenting traditional recipes and cooking techniques through oral histories and publications ensure these culinary traditions are safeguarded for future generations. The role of grassroots organizations and community projects focused on culinary heritage reflects the collaborative spirit of geogastronomy, in which local communities actively engage in preserving their unique food cultures.
Despite the positive impacts of its UNESCO designation, Macau's gastronomic sector faces challenges that deserve attention. A significant concern is the potential dilution of traditional practices due to globalization and mass tourism. With the proliferation of international restaurants and fast-food chains, there is a risk that local culinary traditions will be overshadowed, leading to a loss of cultural identity. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a serious impact on the hospitality and tourism sectors. Restrictions on travel and dining have forced many local businesses to adapt quickly or risk closing.
While some establishments have adopted innovative approaches, such as delivery services and virtual cooking classes, others have struggled to survive in a difficult economic climate. Another challenge lies in the balance between modernization and culinary authenticity. As chefs experiment with fusion cuisines and modern cooking techniques, concerns may arise regarding the integrity of traditional dishes. Finding a balance between innovation and preservation will be essential to maintaining the authenticity of Macanese cuisine. Looking to the future, several developments may emerge in Macau's gastronomy sector. One of the predictable trends is the growing emphasis on sustainable practices.
As consumers become increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their food choices, restaurants and the like in Macau may prioritize local and organic sourcing. This change promotes a sense of community and responsibility towards the environment. Furthermore, technology is likely to continue to reshape the culinary landscape. Advances in food production, preservation and distribution can provide opportunities for growth and innovation. For example, the use of digital platforms can improve marketing efforts and strengthen connections between consumers and local producers. Innovations like vertical farming and aquaponics can also offer sustainable solutions for sourcing ingredients in a densely populated city.
Collaboration between culinary professionals, tourism authorities and the governments of Macau and Mainland provinces will play a crucial role in shaping the evolution of Macau's gastronomic identity. Joint initiatives aimed at promoting food culture, organizing workshops and showcasing local ingredients can raise the profile of Macanese cuisine on the global stage. These collaborative efforts promote community engagement and can mitigate the risks posed by globalization and the pandemic. The future of Macau's gastronomy looks promising, with a growing emphasis on sustainability and innovation. The collaborative spirit of geogastronomy can guide the city in navigating these challenges, ensuring that its rich culinary heritage endures as it adapts to a changing world.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:52:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Dom Dinis's face</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/o-rosto-de-dom-dinis/</link><description>It was now seven hundred years ago on the seventh of January that the most emblematic king of a country absent of features and forms passed away, which in aesthetic and anatomical terms we cannot consider anything emblematically representative, or even dream of the physical form of certain many other representatives, but with him , it happened. We saw him like a Janus reborn in time (however, leaving behind what could have been his young face) and it was with some emotion that we looked at him, and this will not be erased from the collective memory, which was never alien to his charm. .
Dom Dinis is a little like legends and having a face fills us with excitement and strange enthusiasm, which, on the exact day of his grave hour, we had there. The region that crowned him is, however, full of those faces, that Atlantic coast of pine forests and coastline is emblematic in terms of physiognomic similarity, and these things are commotions to add to the great impact of the moment - he came from a mist that those from Avalon perhaps still claimed - and he had the undeniable serenity of a poet.
A monarch may or may not be serene, from a political, state perspective, therefore, but in him we feel something else that does not appear in the reference maps of his own status. Legend has it that he was red-haired, but what has come down to us was that being from the 13th century who died at the age of sixty-three, an age considered to be of great longevity for the time, and his buried body did not represent, as is clear, the other man who outside, and it was the possible image taken from his tomb in Odivelas that came to us like a strange apparition that silenced us and forced us to take a heartfelt bow.
His blue eyes, which are said to have had greenish reflections, his forgotten blond white hair, were what remained and dazzled us: and if we portrayed his grandfather Afonso grandson the harp by which our hearts still align today. The Songs of Saint Mary must also have these blue eyes, that Aragon in his funeral insignia was still his tomb, and this all leaves us, of course, quite thoughtful. He was the sixth Portuguese king, and the quinas will never be able to exercise such order in the demand for their numbers. Perhaps it would have been our Star of David without the recent aspects that define it, when it still, and lovingly, called “its Jews” to itself. He also called the Moors, Templars, and all those who fit his heart.
We address him with the respect intact from seven hundred years later, that our matrix does not stop at roses, nor are our dreams freer than the profound nature of his sense of mission, where he fulfilled and was master, still loving all the lands of his kingdom the women who inspired him: where Afonso Sanches also emerged, a bastard son who followed in the footsteps of a father who cultivated the language and imposed it for the first time as an official language. Then he had a grandson called Pedro, to whom he had given good luck at his birth with gold coins and other recitals so that his voice would be clear as befitted a monarch, but the boy would later be very stuttering, a lover of his grandfather, and the most beautiful prince in the world.
His excremental son, Afonso IV, had battles with tears and some blood, but Dom Dinis did not run away from battles as a man of his time, and his nature must have suffered from the rudeness and blows of these things. He was born on October 9, 1261, was acclaimed king in 1279, and died in 1325 on this January 7, so full of bad memories. We must read it to know how to sing, know the green, smell the pine trees, and know how to build new boats. He also had a truculent profile, a large nose and a tender and tenacious countenance. But the spark that symbolizes beings no science yet knows how to reproduce, identify, and demonstrate as a pragmatic domain.
– Love as a guide “oh God and you are” –</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:49:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Custom violations (I)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/violacoes-por-encomenda-i/</link><description>On December 20th, Hong Kong's TVB reported the case of a French man who had been drugging his wife since 2011 to make her unconscious and then making her available to several men, more than 70, to rape her. The man was only arrested in 2020 for trying to photograph the legs of three women under their skirts, in a supermarket. When he was arrested, the police analyzed his computer and found videos of his wife's rape. Because this crime occurred over a long time, the police were only able to identify 50 of the rapists. The husband was eventually sentenced to 20 years in prison. Although the other 50 defendants claimed that it was all part of sexual games carried out with the couple's connivance, the court did not accept their arguments and they received sentences ranging from 3 to 15 years in prison.
Articles 222-23 of the French Penal Code stipulate that rape is “any type of sexual intercourse against the will of one of the parties, through threat, violence, coercion or accident.” This definition clearly identifies the elements that constitute the crime of rape. Simply put, rape is sexual intercourse with someone against their will and is therefore an assault. In the present case, the husband caused his wife to be raped by third parties, which constitutes the crime of “helping other people to rape.” The husband is primarily responsible and the rapists are accomplices.
What kind of people are these defendants? Are they kind? Are they perverse? We all know the answer, there's no need to say what it is. Morally, the husband is the one who should be held most responsible because he had an obligation to take care of the family, to protect his wife and not let any harm happen to her. How can someone drug a woman to the point of leaving her unconscious and allowing her to be raped by others? This man fulfilled neither the legal obligation of loyalty to his wife nor the moral obligation to love and care for her. No wonder several people made comments online like “A very dangerous husband.”
The World Health Organization proposed the application of the concept “intimate partner violence” to define aggressive and controlling behaviors against former or current intimate partners, such as physical violence, psychological violence, stalking, harassment, financial control, sexual violence, etc. But these behaviors also indicate psychological disorders. This case constitutes extreme sexual violence. Perhaps, while serving his sentence, this man could receive counseling to help him correct these behaviors and resolve his psychological problems.
There is another point that we must pay attention to when analyzing the case. During the period in which these incidents took place, the husband repeatedly used drugs to make his wife unconscious and then invited other men to rape her, which represents an extremely serious situation. In addition to being raped by many men, the woman was drugged many times.  Drugging her into unconsciousness is a serious criminal act. If she had died, her husband could have been charged with murder. Judging by the facts presented, the husband only wanted to satisfy his bestiality and did not even think about how dangerous his actions were. During the 20 years you will spend in prison, you will have the opportunity to reflect, try to be more understanding and stop acting thoughtlessly.
After the case was exposed, the woman, as a victim, decided to file for divorce. Maybe this way, by never seeing each other again, the problem can be resolved. A woman also has to forget the past, start a new life and face each day ahead with a positive attitude.
Furthermore, this woman did not choose to remain anonymous, but rather to reveal her identity. He allowed the court to show a series of videos of his violations during the trial. We can imagine that, in front of the public, broadcasting a video of the rape itself, not only exposes nudity, but also shows all the abuse. These types of images cause a lot of discomfort and women had to accept the different interpretations that people made after seeing the films. This spiritual pain cannot be described in words. However, she limited herself to saying, “the rapist is the one who needs to be ashamed.” The woman decided to face the situation courageously and calmly, which is a rarity. I fear that not even men of great status and talent can behave in this way and possess so much psychological strength.
The woman's permission for the videos to be shown may have another purpose. As some of the suspects have not yet been found, it is not known whether other copies may exist. After this case has become public, even if these copies exist in someone's possession, they cannot be used to threaten them and the issue is closed. Someone who possesses these videos cannot even think of using them to threaten you or cause you any harm.
With the conviction and imprisonment of the husband, the matter must be temporarily closed. This man's behavior destroyed family happiness in the bud. The couple had three children. The blood ties between a father and his children can never be severed. How is this father going to solve the problem with his children? The man is 72 years old and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He will be released when he is 92. Perhaps the news that comes out in 20 years will answer this question.
Next week, we will continue the analysis of this case.

We started a conversation and I was shaken. You were a drug addict and homeless person sleeping on the streets of Lisbon for years. He was identified and sent to a drug addiction recovery center. He recovered and started selling the magazine.
He conveyed to me the absurdity that I want to tell you: for 15 years he has been asking the Lisbon City Council for housing, even if it was a small house with just one room. For 15 years he has received an answer that does not meet the conditions for granting a house. He has lived these 15 years without any privacy and minimum quality conditions in a municipal house with his sister. We contacted the municipal authorities and received a response that there are thousands of “desperate” people asking for a house. Thousands? And all these Portuguese are proof that the Portuguese Constitution has not been complied with for decades, whose legislation says that every citizen has the right to a home.
We continue to see a growing number of homeless people on the streets of Lisbon. Many are not drug addicts. When they fold the blankets offered to them by people sensitive to this drama, they walk to work. It is at the workplace that they eat food, wash and relieve themselves. But they work and after working hours they return to the place where they have some cards on the floor and blankets marking the place. This is shocking.
The Government talks demagogically about solving the housing problem, but what we have seen is authorization for the construction of luxury condominiums. Where is the use of the many billions of euros of PRR coming from the European Union? Where is the construction of social neighborhoods with dignity, where there are health centers, post offices, daycare centers, supermarkets and kindergartens? Where is the government announcement about the construction of affordable homes for homeless citizens with low financial resources? The Left Bloc party last week, in Parliament, asked the Government to inform the future housing plan, something it has already requested several times. You probably won't get an answer because the Government's concern is the Alcochete airport, the various TGV railways, the provision of vacant land for the construction of condominiums with rents impossible for poor people to pay and the privatization of TAP.
The country cannot continue to pretend that it does not see the reality of the lack of housing for students and the poor. It is urgent that we take official notice of the construction of how many homes are to be provided to low-income tenants. Living on the street is painful, it's shocking, it's inhumane, it's unfair, it's illegal and above all it's a failure to comply with the Constitution. The Government cannot continue to accept that hundreds of opportunists exploit university students and evade tax authorities. There are hundreds of cases in which these individuals have a seven-bedroom house, with two bathrooms, and six of them are rented to students at a price of 500 euros each, that is, they have a net monthly income of three thousand euros without issuing a receipt.
The State Budget inserts millions of euros for superfluous actions and this cannot happen. Firstly, there is the decent standard of living of the Portuguese, long before sending millions of euros to Ukraine. There are thousands of “desperate” people who have been waiting for more than a decade to be given a home. Aren’t ministers and mayors ashamed of this situation? Doesn't your heart hurt when you know that your fellow human beings are sleeping on the streets? Do government authorities live with a clear conscience knowing that thousands of Portuguese people need a home and do nothing to solve the problem? Very recently in a neighborhood of Lisbon, a four-story building with several units on each floor was opened. A quality construction. When the foundations were laid, we ourselves went to the Lisbon city council to register and apply for the possibility of obtaining a fraction in that building, as it had been announced by the city council that the building in question would be for affordable rent. The work has finished and the building is occupied by residents who enter the building's garage with top-of-the-range cars, such as BMW, Tesla and Volvo. Do fellow readers think that the fractions were granted to Lisbon residents with low incomes? No. According to our sources, only friends of some directors of the City Council went to live in the building in question. In this sense, the poor will never have a minimally decent home.
In July last year, the president of Lisbon City Council, Carlos Moedas, announced that Lisbon had 3378 homeless people in the city and that of these, 594 were homeless. And in the six months that have passed, how many houses have been built for all these citizens? At the time, Moedas made us laugh in astonishment when he said that the city council would “spend around 70 million euros by 2030 on increasing reception places for the homeless”. Until 2030? This is making fun of the pagoda. Seven years to find “reception places”? An average of 10 million euros per year? Let's be serious and realistic and ask ourselves what can you build with 10 million in a year? And it is this same mayor who last week had the immediate concern of destroying Alexandra Leitão, as soon as she was announced as a Socialist Party candidate for Lisbon City Council, labeling her as a radical politician very close to the Left Bloc. Obviously, as long as a mayor behaves as a supporter of a Government, there will be no concern about building houses for the poor. And those who are “desperate” continue to wait for a house to fall from the sky…</description><pubDate>2025-01-20 06:34:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Exhibition | “GalaxyArt” presents “The Boom and Bloom” until March</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/exposicao-galaxyart-apresenta-the-boom-and-bloom-ate-marco/</link><description>The exhibition “The Boom and Bloom”, with two works created by Ray Chan, from Shenzhen, can be seen until March 9th; and Sanchia Lau, born in Macau. The “GalaxyArt” gallery, open to the public since 2021, hosts this exhibition, which arrives in time to celebrate the arrival of a new Lunar Year, and which is curated by Gary Mok, from Hong Kong.
According to a note from Galaxy, Ray Chan wanted, in “Shake Money Tree”, to mix “pop art with trends popular among young people to reinterpret the traditional blessings of Chinese New Year”. “This is not just a visual and artistic feast; It’s a journey through cultural heritage”, he says, quoted in the same statement. This work therefore revolves “around a pine tree that attracts fortune, symbolizing the harmonious coexistence between wealth and nature and highlighting the importance of financial management”.
In the case of Sanchia Lau, her “Wishing Doll” project brings “a new series of characters with the theme of blessing, in which “the combination of the money tree and the wishing doll represents love and wealth”.
Here “a deep understanding of the pursuit of dreams” is reflected, mixing “auspicious Chinese symbols with modern design, creating a convincing dialogue between tradition and contemporary art”.
This exhibition also features “three thematic works of art specially commissioned and premiered in Macau”, called “Joy and Glory”, the interactive installation that gives the exhibition its name, “Boom and Bloom” and also “A Propicious Omen”, which “incorporates the concepts of love and prosperity, with the lotus – the symbol of Macau – giving a unique touch and representing fortune and harmony for the new year”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:02:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Death | French director Bertrand Blier dies aged 85</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/obito-realizador-frances-bertrand-blier-morre-aos-85-anos/</link><description>French director and screenwriter Bertrand Blier, author of “The Ballerinas” and “Evening Costume”, died on Monday in Paris, aged 85, his family revealed to the France-Presse agency.
For the newspaper Le Figaro, “one of the last giants of French cinema” died, who “knew how to invent his own cinematographic universe” and left “unforgettable films for several generations”.
The filmography, which began in the 1960s, includes, for example, “Hitler, connais pas” (1963), “As if I were a spy” (1967), in which his father, actor Bernard Blier, appears, “The woman from my best friend” and “What a hell of a life!” (1991), with Charlotte Gainsbourg and Anouk Grinberg.
Author of films marked by dark humor and grotesque comedy, Bertrand Blier won the Oscar for Best International Film in 1979 with “A Woman for Two”, starring Carole Laure, Gérard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere.
Gerard Depardieu was, in fact, one of the actors who worked most with Bertrand Blier and whose collaboration marked French cinema in the 1970s and 1980s, with emphasis on “The Ballerinas” (1974), “Crimes in Cold Blood” (1979), “ Too beautiful for you” (1989) and “How much do you love me” (2005).
Regarding “The Ballerinas”, with Depardieu and Dewaere, AFP recalls that this film was considered subversive and cult, and at the same time criticized “for its misogyny and the way it portrayed male predominance”. “Hitler, connais pas” (1963) won him a prize for first works in Locarno (Switzerland) and with “Too Beautiful for You” he won the Grand Jury Prize in Cannes.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:01:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Exhibition | “Flora Macanesis” reveals memories of Macau in Poland</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/exposicao-flora-macanesis-revela-memorias-de-macau-na-polonia/</link><description>Local anthropologist Cheong Kin Man, who has lived in Berlin for many years, has teamed up with Marta Sala, a Polish artist, to create a new exhibition, “Flora Macanesis”, which can be seen in the city of Katowice, Poland, until the 28th of February. In this exhibition, the couple explores family memories and Macau's past, in a combination of artistic installations and textile pieces
 
The exhibition “Flora Macanensis”, the latest project by the artist duo Cheong Kin Man, born in Macau, and Marta Stanisława Sala, Polish, opened to the public on the 7th. This exhibition is on display until February 28th at the Katowice Municipal Public Library, in Poland, but the idea is that it can visit several countries and territories, including Macau.
According to a note released by the Camões Institute in Poland, this exhibition is a work by the duo composed of “a series of seven posters that tell the story of Flora, the artist's mother, who arrived in Macau clandestinely in the 1980s and how the Portuguese amnesty was granted to illegal immigrants in the territory, after a visit by Mário Soares in 1990, changed life in Macau”.
But the exhibition also includes the project “The Compass of Utopia”, with three textile pieces, which tells the story of Cheong Kin Man's father. In this piece, the Macau-born artist and anthropologist ends up “intertwining his father's swimming crossing from China to Macau in 1979, with the stays of the Polish Jesuit Miguel Boym in the mid-17th century and also with the passage of the Polish adventurer Count Benyowsky through Portuguese colony in 1771”.
Gonzaga Gomes and others
In this way, this work mixes not only personal memories of the artist, who has lived in Berlin for many years, but also other pieces of Macau's history. Also in “Flora Macanensis” you can see the experimental video “O Monumento Pronto-a-Vestir”, which includes an interview with navigator and researcher António Abreu Freire. “The audiovisual work, inspired by karaoke, demonstrates, letter by letter, the English, Polish and Cantonese translations of Freire's words in Portuguese”, he highlights.
The exhibition is completed with “two dozen books in Portuguese and published in Macau during the time of Portuguese administration, including works by the sinologist Luís Gonzaga Gomes (1907-1976), the journalist Francisco de Carvalho e Rêgo (1898-1960), as well as as a map 'attempt to geographically reconstruct the Pilgrimage of Fernão Mendes Pinto made by the Viscount of Lagoa'”.
To HM, the duo of artists told that this is the first time they have exhibited in the country where Marta Stanisława Sala is from, with the two wanting to “realize the plan of living between Berlin, Macau, Krakow and Lisbon”. The duo has worked together since 2021, having created “several fictional languages”, always within the areas of art and visual anthropology.
Marta Sala highlights, about “Flora Macanensis”, that “it is not only important to connect the textile and the text in auto-ethnographic narratives, but also the coexistence with people between Berlin, Poland, Macau and Portugal, sources of our creativity” .
The city of Katowice is very close to Marta Sala, as in the place where the public library now stands, her maternal grandfather had a furniture construction workshop during the years of communism. However, Marta Sala never lived in this small town, although her entire family remains there. The idea of ​​exhibiting there came from Marta’s mother.
“The director asked us to contextualize our work and proposed us to focus more on Macau”, highlighted Marta, and in the exhibition presentation session there was a conversation about the duo’s participation in the 2023 Macau Biennale.
Marta Sala adds that, as a duo, they “always seek the universal”, while Cheong Kin Man highlights that it is always natural for him to talk about his homeland, Macau. “Both in Germany and Poland, we always want to talk about Macau in a way that can have some impact. When we talked [in the exhibition's opening conversation] about the existence of three passports in China, Macau and Hong Kong, we asked the audience to imagine customs between Katowice, Krakow and Warsaw. The cases of Macau and Poland are not comparable, but Poland was divided for centuries”, he explained.
In the last year, the duo has not stopped producing artistically, having produced “From Copenhagen with Love” and “As Espantosas e Curiosas Viagens” in Nuremberg, which had the support of Fundação Oriente, among other entities. Cheong Kin Man said that this latest exhibition could take place in Lisbon later this year, with the project being in the negotiation phase.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:59:31</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC | Silk Road antiquities to see until February</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/frc-antiguidades-da-rota-da-seda-para-ver-ate-fevereiro/</link><description>Luís Au, an antiques collector, decided to show the public, with the help of the Rui Cunha Foundation, some old pieces from the Maritime Silk Road period. From this desire, the exhibition “Crescent on the Sea” was born, which features 50 pieces, such as paintings, documents or ceramic pieces ranging from the 4th century to the 19th century.
 
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) opened this Tuesday the Maritime Silk Road Antiquities Exhibition “Crescent on the Sea”, with pieces by collector Luis Au. This is an exhibition that presents a set of around 50 works of art, ceramics, paintings, documents and books from the 4th century to the 19th century, these being examples of objects transported along land and sea routes in mainland China.
The exhibition, which takes place thanks to the collaboration of the Au family, which has always collected ancient pieces, also aims to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the inscription of the Silk Road land corridor between Chang'an (formerly Xi'an) and Tianshan (mountain range that crosses the borders of China, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan) on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2014.
Furthermore, the exhibition, which will be on view at the FRC gallery until February 8th, celebrates the 20th anniversary of the inscription of the Historic Center of Macau on the same UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005.
A work of several years
Quoted in a statement, Luís Au explained that his family “started collecting antiquities from China and Portugal since the 1950s, due to our great passion for studying history”. “After a century of working in Macau, a city with a rich combination of Eastern and Western culture, my family, with a Sino-Portuguese cultural background, dedicated themselves to promoting education about Macau's cultural heritage to value the relics and the local heritage”, he also said.
As for the name of the exhibition, “Crescent on the Sea” refers to the famous crescent-shaped lake, a true oasis surrounded by countless sand dunes in Dunhuang, Gansu province, close to the Gobi desert. In the preface to the exhibition, it is explained that “Dunhuang was an important center of ancient Silk Road trade, which crossed the Eurasian landmass of east-west trade.”
Luís Au adds, however, that “on the southeast coast of China, there was also a “Crescent” at sea, an area full of prosperity and vibrancy linked to around a hundred other ports along the Maritime Silk Road”.
“From Liujiagang (what is now Liuhe, Suzhou province) to Guangzhou, the crescent-shaped area centered on Zayton (Quanzhou) was an important center for shipbuilding and the development of navigation technologies during the Song dynasty, and one of the largest ports in the world”, he highlighted.
The Silk Roads were mainly used to transport raw materials, food and luxury goods. Some areas had a monopoly on certain materials or goods: mainly China, which supplied Central Asia, West Asia and the Mediterranean world with silk, but also porcelain, tea and spices. Many of the high-value commercial goods were transported – by pack animals and river vessels – over great distances and different traders, between the Chinese and Roman empires, flourishing between the 6th and 14th centuries AD and remaining in use until the 16th century.
The Maritime Silk Road, still in the process of study and classification by UNESCO, developed between the ports of Quanzhou, in the province of Fujian, attributed as the starting point of this coastal navigation circuit through the Taiwan Strait, to the port of Ningbo, in Zhejiang province, today one of the three busiest cargo ports in the world.
Macau, with its favorable geographical location on the southern coast of China, became an important maritime trade port and a center for exporting Chinese products to the world from the 16th century onwards.

In a written question, the legislator from the parliamentary bench of the General Women's Association asks whether potential locations for building new blocks can be disclosed and how many units will be made available.
The person responsible also argued that the rent for this type of housing should be lower and more flexible. “As for setting rent values, the Government could create an adjustment mechanism, or draw up different plans for residents depending on their economic condition, in addition to expanding the period and beneficiaries of rent discounts”, he indicated. The deputy's idea is to make the amounts of rent correspond to the social needs and capabilities of the candidates.
Regarding the current residences in Areia Preta, built on the land that was destined for Pearl Horizon, Ma Io Fong believes that there is room for improvement. The deputy gave as an example the speed of traffic lights that only take 11 seconds to cross the road, which represents “a challenge for the elderly”, and asked if the Government has any provisional solution until an overpass for pedestrians is built.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:14:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Flu | Government says it is satisfied with vaccination</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/gripe-governo-diz-estar-satisfeito-com-vacinacao/</link><description>With the flu season and respiratory infections reaching their peak, the Government is satisfied with vaccination and indicates that the number of patients admitted to hospitals in the region is “relatively stable”. Furthermore, cases of acute flu have decreased compared to the previous year
 
The head of the Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Leong Iek Hou, said yesterday that the number of patients hospitalized at Centro Hospitalar Conde São Januário and Hospital Kiang Wu due to influenza is in a “relatively stable” state. The official outlined the situation on the Forum Macau program, on the Chinese channel Radio Macau, revealing that this year there have been fewer cases of acute flu than last year, with the proportion of patients with fever reaching around 16, 2 percent.
The person in charge, who was one of the protagonists during the times of Covid-19, revealed that “the general situation of this year's flu vaccination is satisfactory”. As of last Sunday, more than 179,000 people had been vaccinated against the flu in Macau. The vaccination rate for the elderly in social support institutions stood at 93 percent, while 62 percent of children and more than 80 percent of pre-school and primary school students were inoculated in daycare centers. In relation to secondary schools, the vaccination rate reached almost 70 percent, while adults over 65 recorded a vaccination rate of 55 percent.
However, the official predicted that the flu virus will be active until February, but that other respiratory viruses, such as adenovirus, will continue to be active in winter and spring. As such, Leong Iek Hou recommended the flu vaccine for those who have not yet had one, pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and use a mask to avoid simultaneous infections with multiple pathogens.
Small and large
In a global context, the deputy director of Education and Youth Development Services, Wong Ka Ki, stated that the vaccination rate of non-tertiary education students is almost 80 percent. The official added that students can receive the flu vaccine during school hours with excused absences.
On the other hand, in daycare centers and day centers for the elderly and disabled, control systems have been implemented with daily check-ups first thing in the morning to detect infections or monitor the progress of patients.
Leong Iek Hou also warned the population to be careful about mixing medications, which can interact and cause health problems, and not to buy them on their own in pharmacies, without a prescription or medical recommendation. The official also said that citizens should not purchase medicines to store at home.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:13:47</pubDate></item><item><title>DSSCU | More than 800 lawsuits for illegal works</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/dsscu-mais-de-800-processos-por-obras-ilegais/</link><description>Last year, the Directorate of Land and Urban Construction Services (DSSCU) opened 838 cases due to illegal works, according to information released yesterday.
Among the 838 cases, 238 cases were resolved with voluntary demolitions, which represented an increase of 85 percent compared to 2023. There were also 39 cases concluded with the imposition of fines for carrying out illegal works, with fine slips being issued in the amount of around 1.5 million patacas.
The fines relating to 8 cases were not paid within the set deadline, so the Administration promised to proceed with coercive collection, through the courts. In a statement, DSSCU stated that it gives “priority to cases of new illegal works, renovation of illegal works, buildings in a state of disrepair and cases of illegal works”.
“DSSCU therefore calls on citizens to jointly safeguard the safety of buildings and create an environment with good living conditions and not to violate the law”, it was added.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:11:53</pubDate></item><item><title>EPM | MICE gave “precise” instructions to restore “regular functioning”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/epm-mice-deu-instrucoes-precisas-para-repor-regular-funcionamento/</link><description>Given the “official” lack of knowledge on the part of the Association Promoting Education for Macanese (APIM) of the intention to build a new block at EPM, the Minister of Education, Science and Innovation says he is monitoring the situation and indicates that Jorge Neto Valente has been appointed by the previous minister
 
The Minister of Education, Science and Innovation of Portugal claims to be “vigilant” regarding the operation of the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) and argues that the representatives of the Portuguese State at the Foundation of the Portuguese School of Macau (FEPM) received “precise instructions for the restoration of the regular functioning of the EPM”. It was in this way that Fernando Alexandre reacted, to HM, through his office, when asked about the recent dispute between the president of FEPM, appointed by the Portuguese State, and the Associação Promotora da Instrução dos Macaenses (APIM), over the announcement of the construction of a new block, which will not have been discussed by the FEPM Board of Directors.
“The current Minister of Education, Science and Innovation is vigilant regarding the functioning of the EPM and has remained permanently informed, with precise instructions having been transmitted to the representatives of the Portuguese State to restore the regular functioning of the EPM”, it can be read, in the response sent to HM.
Last week, Jorge Neto Valente, as president of FEPM, revealed his intention to build a new block in the building where the school operates and considered that the concession of the land where the EPM building is located had expired in 2014.
The announcement came as a surprise to APIM, the land concessionaire, which, in a statement sent to Canal Macau, stated that it was officially unaware of the intention to build a block. The message signed by Miguel de Senna Fernandes, president of APIM and vice-president of FEPM, also states that the matter was not discussed by the FEPM Board of Directors. The statement also denies that there was any expiry of the land in 2014.
The ministry did not detail the instructions issued in the response to HM, but in August last year, after an inspection carried out by the General Inspectorate of Education and Science (IGEC) on the functioning of the EPM, Fernando Alexandre left a correction to the functioning of the Council of Administration of FEPM, highlighting the need for decisions to be taken by the five members of the council, and not just by the president.
Currently, the FEPM CA is made up of five members: three chosen by the Portuguese State, namely Jorge Neto Valente, as president, Patrícia Ribeiro and Raul Capaz, one member chosen by the Associação Promotora da Instrução dos Macaenses (APIM), Miguel de Senna Fernandes , vice-president, and another member resulting from the consensus of the CA, who is currently José Basto da Silva.
Legacies of the past
Regarding the existence of yet another dispute within the FEPM Board of Directors, after the dismissal of several teachers last year, Fernando Alexandre pointed out that the appointment of Jorge Neto Valente to the position of president of the FEPM Board of Directors was decided by the previous Minister of Education, João Costa.
“The current president of the Foundation of the Portuguese School of Macau was appointed to occupy the position by the previous Minister of Education”, it was indicated.
In the statement sent to Canal Macau, and contrary to what had been stated by Neto Valente, APIM also argued that although the land is allocated to the provision of educational services, there is no obligation for these to be provided by EPM. In relation to this aspect, and when asked about the possibility of APIM advancing a possible eviction, which would create the need to find a plan B, the Government of Portugal rejected this scenario, and indicated that APIM has “always maintained an attitude of full respect for her role as founder” of FEPM.
The ministry also argued that, in accordance with the Statutes of the Fundação Escola de Macau, “the provision of the land in question by APIM, as founder, forms part of the initial capital of the EPM Foundation” and “only by the extinction of FEPM could the land be allocated for another purpose.”</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:07:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Av. da Ponte Macau | New lane opened</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/av-da-ponte-macau-aberta-nova-faixa-de-rodagem/</link><description>The authorities announced that from Sunday onwards part of the new carriageway on Avenida da Ponte Macau, on the east side of Zone A of the New Urban Landfills, will be opened to the public.
In a statement, the Public Works Department (DSOP) indicated that from that day onwards “vehicles entering the Macau Peninsula to the Macau Customs Post from the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and Macau Bridge need to use the new Avenida of the Macau Bridge”. With the changes, DSAT argues that the new traffic routes will be “more convenient than the current ones”.
At the same time, Avenida do Mar de Espelho will be “temporarily closed”, no longer allowing traffic, except for access to the construction sites in that area, but only for “authorized vehicles”. In light of these changes, DSOP asks drivers to “pay attention to the traffic signs in place and the changed route”.
Previously, DSOP and the Directorate of Traffic Affairs Services (DSAT) organized a visit with members of the Traffic Advisory Council and representatives of associations to Zone A and the artificial island, to learn about the new traffic arrangements, as well as to hear the opinions of counselors.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 00:14:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Flu | Collective cases affect almost 50 people</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/gripe-casos-colectivos-afectam-quase-50-pessoas/</link><description>Seven cases of collective flu infection affected 49 people, according to a statement issued yesterday by the Health Services (SS).

The Health Services announced the occurrence of a new case of collective gastroenteritis that affected 13 people, including 11 elderly people who live at the Salvation Army's Rui Xi Integrated Services Center for the Elderly and two workers.
According to the statement revealed yesterday, the majority of those infected are female, with a total of 10 occurrences. Three are male. “Since January 16th, patients began to successively present symptoms such as fever, vomiting and diarrhea, with some of them undergoing treatment in health institutions”, it was reported.
“There were no records of serious cases or other serious complications.

A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, leaves us with his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: high There, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.

At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. It says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife. — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, usually, this phrase is used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in the other. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this mistake. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who loved no one./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria remained with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide -he and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered history.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely external to our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J. Pinto Fernandes emerges at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment by Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize winner: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at having been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature to Thomas Traströmer, a complete unknown. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but that just brings me the comfort of knowing that the world isn't a soap opera where everyone know and the joy of recognizing that the yardstick of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that doesn't take away from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written the “ Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her novel “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Coast.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and writers from the north Macua-Mozambican, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thoughts about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technology and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché "all different, all the same", a return to "diplomacy", given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that "we are unified because we share the same nature" but highlights simply that we “do not yet share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the depths of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our dilated pupils of astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that can satisfy your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and imposing, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the nocturnal whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
Men should refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the fields will perish as a result. cultivated, for it the meek animals will be beheaded, for it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and for it the pride of countries will be destroyed.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert».
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that gag, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in relationships were limited. human beings, or if it simply lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, which is then declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), there is a lack of world in Pascoaes. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but a also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at eight years old – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Evidently, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, in a different way, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE

What is clear today, at this disastrous moment in which Cristiano &amp; Company failed in their mission in Braga, and in which the self-sabotage of Russia's gas pipelines reminds us that Putin will indeed be willing to do anything to maintain dominance over the areas endorsed,
is that, bomb for bomb, the “bomb” of the Fifth Empire was preferable.
However, even in this, my dears, we were irresolute, a little more on the side of piela than determined, and we procrastinated.</description><pubDate>2022-09-29 02:34:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Davos | Beijing warns of “unimaginable” consequences of dividing the world</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/davos-pequim-alerta-para-consequencias-inimaginaveis-de-divisao-do-mundo/</link><description>Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang warned yesterday, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, of the dangers of a possible division of the world into two separate systems, warning that the consequences would be “unimaginable” and would seriously harm humanity.
Speaking in the Swiss city, Ding highlighted that the international community is increasingly concerned about this risk, as “it would be very difficult to face common challenges together”, including climate change, food security and the energy transition, “ if the world is divided.”
The Chinese leader warned of the risks of confrontation in the “worst case scenario”, a situation in which “no country could remain indifferent”. “Davos continues to be a fundamental forum for discussing global issues and fostering international cooperation, promoting new ideas for common progress,” he said.
Ding also called for global solidarity, stressing that international cooperation is essential to overcome turbulence and build a common future. According to the official, China has been a firm supporter of multilateralism and remains committed to the law-based international system, with the UN at its center.
The deputy prime minister highlighted his country's commitment to building inclusive economic globalization, noting that, despite “divergences regarding its distribution”, this continues to be a “win-win” trend. China is a “defender and builder” of the international order, he assured.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:58:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Stock markets fall after Trump threatens to raise rates</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/economia-bolsas-caem-apos-trump-ameacar-com-subida-de-taxas/</link><description>Chinese stock markets fell during yesterday's session, after the new North American President, Donald Trump, suggested that he will apply 10 percent duties on imports from China, in retaliation for the flow of fentanyl.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's benchmark index, the Hang Seng, fell 1.73 percent at around 1:30 p.m. local time, weighing especially on technology stocks, which are among the hardest hit by tensions between the two biggest powers. worldwide.
In mainland China, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges were also in the red at the same time, with a drop of 1 percent and 0.92 percent, respectively.
“We're talking about a 10 percent rate based on the fact that they're shipping fentanyl to Mexico and Canada,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.
The Republican leader said that he spoke “the other day” with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and that he told him that he did not want that “crap” in the country.

Sunac, once one of China's largest property developers, became the first company in the sector to successfully restructure its debt issued in domestic markets (“onshore”), after gaining support from creditors.
In a statement sent to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where it is listed, the company stated that the creditors of these obligations, of which around 15.4 billion yuan remained to be paid, approved the plan presented by the company.
The proposal envisaged a reduction to less than half of this amount and offered several options, such as extending the maturity of the bonds until 2034, without the obligation to start paying them until 2029.
Sunac had already been a pioneer among Chinese prosecutors when, in October 2023, it obtained approval from the Hong Kong court for the agreement it had reached with creditors to restructure around US$10.2 billion of debt issued on the markets. international (“offshore”).
Debt rating agency Standard&amp;Poor's (S&amp;P) stated at the time that Sunac would pave the way for restructuring the offshore debt of other Chinese developers in similar situations, as it not only sought to prolong obligations to save time, but also included instruments such as debt swaps.
However, on March 10, state-owned asset manager Cinda filed a liquidation application against the company in Hong Kong for non-payment of a $30 million loan. The first hearing was scheduled for March 19th.
This case is distinguished from similar ones, such as those also faced in Hong Kong by giants such as Evergrande or Country Garden, by the fact that the complainant is a Chinese state-owned company and not a private creditor, despite Beijing having repeatedly promised measures to stabilize the real estate market in recent months.
Serious wound
The promoter's shares in Hong Kong fell more than 25 percent following this news. Yesterday, despite the agreement with onshore creditors, they fell 2.41 percent during the morning part of the session.
Sunac had total liabilities of about 896 billion yuan at the end of the first half of 2024, during which it recorded a net loss of 14.957 billion yuan.
The financial situation of many Chinese real estate companies worsened after Beijing announced, in August 2020, restrictions on access to bank financing for developers who had accumulated a high level of debt, including Evergrande, with liabilities of almost 330 thousand millions of dollars.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:53:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Afghanistan | Taliban claim Chinese citizen was killed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/afeganistao-talibas-afirmam-que-cidadao-chines-foi-morto/</link><description>A Chinese citizen was killed in northeastern Afghanistan, a Taliban police spokesman announced yesterday, despite the murder of foreigners being rare in the country, especially since the withdrawal of US troops in 2021.
Police spokesman Mohammed Akbar in Takhar province said the man was killed on Tuesday night by “unknown persons” when he was on his way to Dasht-e-Qala district.
Akbar said the Chinese national, surnamed Li, traveled to an unknown destination with his interpreter and without informing security authorities. The interpreter was not injured in the incident, according to Akbar. “The police have begun their initial investigation. Stay tuned for more details,” Akbar added, without providing further information.
A group called the National Mobilization Front claimed responsibility for the murder and said its fighters targeted the Chinese man's vehicle. The group alleged that Li was training Taliban intelligence in monitoring social media platforms, without providing evidence.
Asked about the incident, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said yesterday that she was not familiar with the matter. “I believe that the Chinese Embassy in Afghanistan will do everything in its power to protect the safety of Chinese citizens and we will monitor the situation,” he said.
China is of particular importance to the Taliban, who are courting foreign investment and regional alliances in the face of their continued isolation on the international stage due to their crackdown on women.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:50:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Panama | Beijing says it never interfered in channel management</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/panama-pequim-diz-que-nunca-interferiu-na-gestao-do-canal/</link><description>China assured yesterday that it “never interfered” in the management of the Panama Canal and that it “always respected” Panamanian sovereignty over the infrastructure, after US President Donald Trump insisted that the canal is under the country's control.

The spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Guo Jiakun, stressed at a press conference that climate change is a global challenge that requires the cooperation of all countries.
“Climate change is a common challenge for all humanity and no country can act alone for its own benefit”, he stated. He reiterated Beijing's commitment to continue to actively face this challenge. “China’s determination and actions on climate change continue to be consistent,” he said.
Guo also emphasized that China will work with all countries with the aim of advancing the global transformation to “a green and low-carbon economy”. These statements from Beijing follow Trump's signing, on Monday, of an executive order to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.

The caravan that was supposed to transport Yoon back to the detention center south of Seoul, where he has been held in pre-trial detention for a week, left the Constitutional Court in the middle of the afternoon and headed directly to the hospital.
According to the presidential office and legal sources cited by Yonhap, Yoon was taken to the hospital to undergo medical examinations. The trip to the hospital was authorized by the director of the detention center where he is, the agency added.
Before the court, Yoon denied that he had ordered the military to remove deputies from parliament to prevent them from voting to reject the martial law decree, according to the US agency AP.
After abruptly imposing martial law on December 3, Yoon sent troops and police officers to surround the National Assembly. However, enough deputies managed to get in to vote unanimously to reject the decree, forcing Yoon's office to lift the measure the next morning.
The National Assembly approved Yoon's dismissal on December 14, a decision that will have to be judged by the Constitutional Court. Yoon's appearance in court was his first public appearance since becoming South Korea's first sitting president to be detained over the declaration of martial law, which plunged the country into political crisis.

Last year, the country installed about 277 gigawatts (GW) of new solar power capacity, compared to 217 GW in 2023, and 80 GW of new wind power capacity, also more than the previous year, according to the figures published by the National Energy Administration (NEA), an agency of the Chinese Government.
China, which is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has seen the most meteoric rise in the installation of renewable capacity in recent years. Beijing wants to reach its peak CO2 emissions in 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060.
Its total installed capacity of solar and wind energy is currently 887 GW and 521 GW, respectively, more than 15 percent of the target of 1,200 GW installed by 2030, set by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2020.
The country, which is building more solar and wind energy capacity than the rest of the world combined, invested more than US$50 billion in this field between 2011 and 2022, according to data from the International Energy Agency.

EAST (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak), located in the city of Hefei, in eastern China, managed to generate and maintain plasma for 1,066 seconds, more than 17 minutes, surpassing its previous record of 403 seconds, achieved in 2023, revealed on Monday Chinese state agency Xinhua said on Friday.
The agency described this new record as “a fundamental step towards the development of a fusion reactor”, reported the Efe agency. The ultimate goal of EAST is to create nuclear fusion similar to that of the Sun, using substances abundant in the sea to provide a constant flow of energy.
Since its launch in 2006, EAST has been “an open testbed for Chinese and international scientists to conduct fusion-related experiments and investigations,” Xinhua further detailed.
According to scientist Song Yuntao, cited by the agency, the temperature and density of the particles increased considerably during this high-confinement plasma operation. This operation will establish “a solid foundation to improve the power generation efficiency of future fusion plants and reduce costs.”</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:43:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Francisco Leandro, author and professor at the University of Macau: “Support from the country reinforces Macau’s role as a platform”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/16/francisco-leandro-autor-e-professor-na-universidade-de-macau-apoio-do-pais-reforca-o-papel-de-plataforma-de-macau/</link><description>Gang Wen's interview with China Daily newspaper
Francisco Leandro, associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Macau, says that the nation's support has allowed the Macao SAR to serve as a center for trade, investment and cultural interactions between China and Portuguese-speaking communities.
 
 
How do you see Macau developing since your return to your homeland? Among the city's achievements, which ones impressed you the most? What about your sector, has there been any important progress in the last 25 years?
The 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the Motherland and the creation of the Macau Special Administrative Region constitutes a significant milestone in the region's history, reflecting a successful diplomatic process and demonstrating its current political and economic stability. Currently, the Macau SAR enjoys political stability and is deeply integrated into national development plans. The city's governance under the “one country, two systems” principle allowed it to maintain a high degree of autonomy while aligning with national policies. This integration has facilitated Macau's economic growth, making it a vital part of the country's broader economic strategy.
Macau’s socio-economic development strategy is enshrined in the “one center, one platform, one base” policy. This framework aims to position Macao SAR as a global tourism and leisure center, reinforcing its attraction as a global tourist destination. Furthermore, the Macao SAR functions as a platform for economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, promoting international trade and cultural exchange. The Macau SAR is also becoming a base for cultural exchange and cooperation, promoting cultural interactions and heritage conservation. This multifaceted approach supports Macau's integration into national development plans and strengthens its global presence. The MSAR's unique position as a bridge between China, in particular the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and Portuguese-speaking countries highlights its strategic importance.
The concept of “one platform, three centers” highlights Macau’s role in promoting economic and cultural exchange. This platform allowed the city to serve as a platform for trade, investment and cultural interactions, strengthening ties between China and the Portuguese-speaking world.
Macau's development as a tourism and leisure hub, along with the promotion of four main industries – conventions and exhibitions, cultural and creative industries, traditional Chinese medicine and modern financial services – has diversified its economy. These initiatives not only boosted economic activity, but also reinforced Macau's global attraction as a tourist destination.
The central government has adopted a series of policies for Macau. Is there any specific measure that has benefited your sector? As?
Mainland China and Macau's Enhanced Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) play a crucial role in the Greater Bay Area and in promoting ties with Portuguese-speaking countries. By promoting commercial and economic cooperation, CEPA reinforces the Macao SAR's position as a bridge between China and Portuguese-speaking countries. This agreement facilitates market access, investment and cultural exchange, promoting Macau as an international business center. Furthermore, CEPA supports Macau's integration into the Greater Bay Area, contributing to regional development and economic diversification. This strategic role underscores Macau's importance in the country's broader economic and diplomatic initiatives.
The promotion of higher education in the Macau SAR also played a crucial role in its development. By investing in education and research, Macau contributed to national development objectives and positioned itself as a center of academic excellence. This investment in education allowed the creation of a qualified workforce, essential to sustain economic growth and innovation. The University of Macau is highly regarded in global academic rankings. It was ranked 180th in the World University Rankings 2025 by Times Higher Education, and 245th in the QS World University Rankings 2025. Furthermore, the University of Macau is ranked 262nd in the Best Global Universities by US News &amp; World Report. These rankings reflect the university's commitment to excellence in teaching and research, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence, engineering and social sciences. The university's strong international collaboration and innovative research contribute significantly to its esteemed global position.
This year marks the third anniversary of the establishment of the Guangdong-Macao In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin. In your opinion, how should Macau continue to take advantage of the area's advantages to develop itself and the education sector?
The Hengqin Cooperation Zone is one of the main objectives of Macau's modernization efforts. This zone has been instrumental in boosting innovation and economic diversification, providing a space for new industries and promoting closer integration with the continent. The area exemplifies Macau's commitment to modernization and its strategic role in regional development.
Macau is a unique blend of Chinese and Portuguese cultures. In your opinion, how can this merger help the nation to strengthen communication with the international community and tell China's good stories?
Macau is a fascinating mix of cultures, where East meets West in a unique and harmonious way. Its linguistic landscape is a testament to its multicultural heritage. Chinese is the official language and the Portuguese language can be used for official purposes, reflecting Macau's historical ties with Portugal and its Chinese roots. English is also widely spoken, especially in business and tourism, making Macau a truly multilingual society.
The Macao SAR legal system is another area in which this cultural mix is ​​evident. Based on the Portuguese civil law system, it was adapted to the local context under the “one country, two systems” principle. This dual legal system allows for a unique blend of Chinese and Western legal traditions, ensuring that Macau's legal environment is familiar to its residents and accessible to international businesses.
Macau's approach to extrajudicial resolution of commercial disputes further highlights its multicultural policy. The city offers various arbitration and mediation services that serve both local and international parties, promoting efficient and amicable dispute resolution. Macau's open city policy and multicultural attitude are key to its success as a global hub. The city welcomes people from all over the world, promoting a diverse and inclusive community. This openness is reflected in its festivals, its gastronomy and its daily life, where different cultures coexist and enrich each other. Essentially, Macau's mix of languages, legal systems and multicultural attitudes makes it a unique and dynamic place that builds bridges between cultures and promotes global connections.
What achievements would you like to see Macau achieve in the next 25 years?
In short, Macau's future is bright, with greater integration with mainland China, its central role in international trade, diversified economic growth and a strong global presence. These elements will ensure Macau’s continued success and development on the world stage. The 25th anniversary of Macau's return to its homeland celebrates not only a successful diplomatic achievement, but also the region's ongoing contributions to national and global development. Macau's strategic initiatives and its integration into national plans highlight its importance as a dynamic and future-oriented region.</description><pubDate>2024-12-16 02:20:12</pubDate></item><item><title>António Antunes, cartoonist: “Sometimes I consider myself an artist”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/12/antonio-antunes-cartoonista-as-vezes-considero-me-um-artista/</link><description>His name is António Antunes, but he signs his cartoons simply as António. For 50 years he has characterized current affairs using drawing and humor, much of it at Expresso. In an interview, the cartoonist, who drew the times after the 25th of April, regrets that today young cartoonists do not have as many opportunities to make a career
This 50-year adventure dedicated to cartoons has been a long one. Did you ever think you would do this for so many years?
No. Things happened, and this is the result. There wasn't even any prospect of a plan. Portugal has not been a country that greatly favors this type of activities.
He trained at the António Arroio School during the Estado Novo period. What was it like to learn arts at a time when the country [Portugal] was so gray, with limits to creativity?
We mainly learned techniques, work or composition. Now creativity is another thing. Not only was it very limited, but it is also not something that can be sold. There are no courses to make artists, there are courses that give us notions about composition or painting techniques, or colors. But that alone is not enough. Then there needs to be something beyond what is academic. In the arts there is always something that escapes even if you learn everything. Creativity is a strange thing, because there is no rule.
Does António consider himself an artist?
(Hesitates) Sometimes I consider it.
There have been many controversial cartoons, including Pope John Paul II with a condom on his nose. Which cartoons forced you to be more flexible or to deal with more pressure?
Maybe it's my happiness, but my problems are never a priori, but rather a posteriori. Until now I have not been very limited in what I can do at the [Expresso] newspaper. Now, when things come out, sometimes they have consequences. In Portugal it was the issue of condoms for the Pope, internationally it was other things. This cartoon continues to move.
What was it like dealing with all this controversy?
This cartoon [of Pope John Paul II] was controversial because they wanted it to be that way. It turned out very well and didn't create any fuss. Then there was a conservative movement within the Church that wanted to make it a controversy, within three weeks they started hyping it up, creating a petition. The man who led the Catholic forces said he expected a million signatures, but, fortunately, he only got 29,000, and the difference meant that the mountain didn't even give birth to a mouse. It was even discussed in the Assembly [of the Republic]. It's a rather insignificant controversy, even more so, 30 years later, when the Church itself is changing its point of view on this matter, particularly with this Pope [Francis], fortunately. Given what led me to do this cartoon, I would do it again. The Pope's statements at the time were public, they were not even hidden, within walls, and he spoke to the whole world, therefore, also to me. I felt injured, that it didn't make any sense. I think the Pope's attitude, at that time, was criminal, at the height of AIDS and in Africa. It was enormously insensitive and foolish.
Is the cartoon a throwing weapon, a form of expression?
Throwing a weapon is too harsh an expression, but the cartoon is, in fact, the way I express myself. There are colleagues of mine who make articles, but I make drawings.
What other cartoons do you highlight for what they brought to you?
The first one that touched me was the one that made me win the biggest cartoon show in the world at the time [Grand Prize of the XX Salon International de Cartoon, Montreal, 1983], from this little corner of Portugal. A Show that had more than a thousand participants, and winning was very good. I felt safer, more confident, because from then on things could continue to be done. That first cartoon also caused controversy, the “Warsaw Ghetto in Shatila”, in which I use the well-known photograph of the ghetto, of a Jewish kid with his hands raised, chased by Nazi soldiers, and in the cartoon the kid is Palestinian and the soldiers are Israeli. [The controversy occurred] with all the voices of the Jews, who are experts in this, making a lot of noise, with a certain tone of victimization, even though they were the ones attacking. A director of the Hall said that he tried to change the vote, such is the weight of the Jewish lobby, but he was unable to do so.
This cartoon could be drawn again today.
I've already published it again. Unfortunately it is not out of date.
But do you feel that much of what you drew about current affairs is repeated, a sign that History is cyclical?
There is resistance to change. One of the cartoonist's merits is being able to see ahead of time, or at the top of time, if you like. I have the invasion of Crimea carried out in 2014, and I assume that vision. It was on top, and others did it later. There are other examples.
He began making cartoons after April 25, 1974, shortly after the Revolution. Do you feel that, in a way, you inaugurated the discipline of political cartooning in Portugal?
Perhaps. But I'm not very clear about that, because before me there was a great designer, João Abel Manta, a fantastic graphic artist, who had a huge difference in relation to us, as we were kids and he already had a culture that allowed him to that. But there is a less good side, as he did political propaganda. He was a man from the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), and he carried out this propaganda as far as the Revolution allowed. Then when things stabilized, he left and did other things. That doesn't take away from its quality, but it's not my idea of ​​a cartoon. I respond to the various stimuli of events in a different way. The cartoon allows me to express my opinions, but being able to do so from different directions of life, perspectives, without being a prisoner, as he was a prisoner of the PCP, was something that helped me a lot.
Have you ever felt any pressure from the newspapers where you contributed?
(Hesitates). Some things, but they are not important. One thing I managed, without much effort, was to make people think that I had a really bad temper, and that it was better not to mess with me. This helped, because they thought twice before talking to me. Once at Expresso, a sports guy ordered a cover from me, and started giving me tips on how I should draw it. Until I asked him if I had ever told him how to write a news story. This must have remained in his memory for many years, and this conversation must have resonated with other people. I didn't go to Expresso, I was always in my corner and didn't get worn out by day-to-day life, with friendships and enmities.
Do you usually draw here, in the studio?
Here. But that [the ill-tempered image] actually helped me. And there is also the story of me having another profession. I usually say that I really had two professions, as I was a cartoonist and a graphic designer, and then I had clients of mine who were also from Expresso, namely A Tabaqueira. I was a friend of the commercial director, a self-indulgent type, who got me involved in negotiating contracts with the newspaper on behalf of A Tabaqueira. Therefore, I conveyed an effective image of power that, in reality, I did not have. If you combine a guy who has a bad temper with a guy who apparently has power, it's a bummer (laughs).
When I ask him about the pressures, I think of the period right after the 25th of April, 1974-1975, when everything was politicized. Were they bigger then?
I managed to deal with it. During this period of PREC (Revolutionary Process in Progress) there was even a cartoon about PREC that lasted two years. It was a kind of forward flight. There was a lot of confusion, and, I think, this was of interest to my newspaper [Expresso], although this was never said. It gave an idea of ​​the newspaper's freshness in relation to a complex period, but I was never told that. I have the idea of ​​the cartoon's usefulness, it was a way of consolidating the newspaper's independence in relation to events, even when sometimes there was no such independence.
Are we today in an era of political correctness, where everything seems to offend?
I don't feel it, because I don't want to feel it. I've reached a stage in my life where if they don't want to put up with me, don't. It's easy. Everything that was a struggle to impose a name and a point of view, a career, has already been done. It can be improved and consolidated, but if it isn't, it isn't. If I become too inconvenient for the newspaper where I work, and I want to believe that doesn't happen...
But in general terms, regarding the news, comments on social media, do you feel there is political correctness?
Of course there is. My situation is exceptional. Younger people, in the world of cartoons, don't have any opportunities. They have less than when I started. Due to various accidents in life, I have a position that has solidified, but this is not an example of what is happening around me. The new cartoonists are full of problems, there is no space for them, there is no means of payment. They are pushed to get out of the newspapers, not into them.
Does the cartoon have no place on social media?
(Hesitates) It may appear, but it doesn't seem to me… they say that journalism is dying and we, cartoonists, go first. I think this is the trend. Journalism has been losing power in the face of social media, with anonymous opinion, which cannot be scrutinized, is very bad and mediocre. And this will grow.
What about Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Can replace the cartoonist.
I'm not even talking about this because I don't know the limits, but I understand that they must be terrible. It can indeed replace the cartoonist, but then creativity is subverted.
Are there any public figures that you particularly enjoy portraying in cartoons?
The other day I said that, in relation to Trump, I had two antagonistic feelings: as a citizen, I find the man detestable; but as a cartoonist it is my raw material. Putin is good too. All men with lots of narratives and lots of power are likely to give good things from the point of view of a cartoonist's analysis. They are politicians with a very clear speech about what they want and what they want, and that could be good for the cartoon.
How do you feel about going to Macau again?
The exhibition [at Clube Militar] will be different from the others, with 160 works. It's still a lot. It's a journey through these years, through Portuguese and international politics as well. I'm full of curiosity, promoting the exhibition, seeing what people ask me, but that's part of the game.
The Macau press does not have a large cartoon presence, with the exception of Rodrigo [Rodrigo de Matos].
I know him, I get along well with him. But I must say that the phenomenon is similar to Portugal. What do we have here? Me, at Expresso; Cristina Sampaio at Público; André Carrilho left Diário de Notícias; António Maia in Correio da Manhã and little else. This is a general trend. Sometimes, and I think this happened to me, there are moments when a cartoonist can represent an asset to the newspaper, but there are only a few moments when this can happen. In my most complicated period at Expresso, at the end of the 70s, a reference newspaper that, at the time, was in a country in turmoil, with some “irresponsibility” I was able to go ahead, and I have the perception that I helped the newspaper to untangle itself these limitations. But this happens in very specific periods. At that stage [after the 25th of April], I even made drawings at night that, by day, were already out of date.
Do you really have a bad temper or is it just a disguise?
I'm shy, but I'm taking care of myself. (laughs) It was never something that blocked me, I speak well in public. I'm a guy who doesn't like taking stupid risks. I've been in this building for several years and I only know the concierge because I have to, and I don't want to run the risk of having an unfriendly person who I've given trust to. I do this with the utmost naturalness.
Exhibition at the Military Club

This Friday follows the opening of the exhibition at Clube Militar, which will be on view until January 2nd.</description><pubDate>2024-12-12 00:58:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Gaming Analyst Ben Lee on New Concessions: “We Need Something Big”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/03/ben-lee-analista-de-jogo-sobre-as-novas-concessoes-precisamos-de-algo-grandioso/</link><description>Gaming analyst and consultant Ben Lee believes that much more needs to be done to diversify Macau's economy beyond gaming, especially taking into account the type of events organized under the new concessions. The analyst thinks Macau could look to two resorts in Vietnam as examples to follow to attract international tourists
 
What is your assessment of the two years of new gaming concessions?
There is still a lot of work to do. From what we have seen so far, the concessionaires have focused on lighter projects, such as local art galleries, cultural events, holding concerts and small rehabilitations of cultural neighborhoods. The big projects, like the high-tech amusement park, the Conservatory or new hotels are yet to be seen. Since two of the ten years [of the concession] have already passed, and taking into account that the construction of some of these projects is expected to take several years, it seems that it will be necessary to postpone them. Revenues from the non-gaming segment, as a percentage of gross revenue earned by concessionaires, appear to be higher than in 2019, but have declined in the last two years. It is possible that they will return to between 10.5 and 11 percent in 2019 in the next two years.
Recently, Ho Iat Seng thanked the concessionaires for fulfilling the contracts and collaborating in the development of the non-gaming segment, reiterating that they managed to make some profits during the pandemic. Do you think your words were fair?
Casinos are making efforts to develop the non-gaming segment, but once again, most of these efforts are focused on lighter, lower-level events. We don't see big ideas like the $2.3 billion investment sphere that we see in Las Vegas, for example. If this happened, it would easily fit into the commitments of 15 billion dollars promised by the concessionaires [when signing the new contracts]. We could also talk about the idea of ​​holding a Formula 1 competition on the street, as seen in Singapore and recently in Las Vegas.
How do you analyze the recovery of operators in terms of gaming revenue in recent months?
The recovery of gaming in Macau has been extremely good, with the sector expected to recover to around 78 or 79 percent of the levels recorded in 2019.
Sociedade de Jogo de Macau (SJM), for example, was one of the gaming operators with the greatest difficulties in terms of cash flow during the pandemic. Do you consider that your recovery, compared to the other five, was positive?
SJM struggled at first, but appears to be finally making some progress. But they will still face some challenges in repositioning their “hardware” [installations and other projects] in the future.
What can we expect from the new Sam Hou Fai Government in the gaming area?
The elected Chief Executive appears to be trying to ensure that operators honor their commitments. His two terms will likely cover the next eight years of the new concessions. I think that, ultimately, it will all come down to whether he can motivate the various government apparatuses to execute his vision and mission.
As part of the new contracts, how do you see the global evolution of the gaming sector?
In 2019, the percentage of non-gaming segment revenues compared to gaming revenues reached 10.5 percent. This percentage rose to 22 percent during Covid-19, and has since gradually fallen to 13.5 percent, according to data from the third quarter of this year. This percentage will continue to decrease as gaming revenues continue to grow. In recent times, we have seen residents of Macau and Hong Kong heading north [China] to save money. The question that arises is why would the inhabitants of the continent go down and do the opposite? The solution, as predicted by the authorities, is that Macau needs to diversify the market [of tourists and players] that comes from the mainland. This makes perfect logical sense, but the reality is that our efforts seem to be regressing. Visitors from outside greater China represented 7.8 percent of total visitors to Macau, but decreased to 6.5 percent by the end of September this year. This refers to the light events that have been organized which, by far and to a large extent, are really oriented towards the Chinese who, after all, constitute the majority of our source of revenue.
How can this situation be turned around?
Going back to the beginning, I think we really need something big, iconic, similar to the sphere you see in Las Vegas or even something similar to the “Golden Bridge” project in Da Nang, worthy of appearing on Instagram, or the “Golden Bridge” project in Da Nang, worthy of appearing on Instagram, or the “Golden Bridge” of the Kiss”, in Phu Quoc, both in Vietnam. The fact that these projects were built by a local group linked to the hotel sector, without any connection to profits from gambling, demonstrates creativity and a long-term perspective in terms of planning.
Class struggle
Ben Lee warns of the danger of the mass market “fleeing” Macau
The conversation with Ben Lee comes in the context of a lecture he recently gave about the two years of the new gaming concessions. Promoted by the France-Macau Chamber of Commerce, the session was called “Macau New Gaming Landscape: Two years into concessions, what now?”, with the analyst and managing partner of IGamiX Management &amp; Consulting defending it, according to the Asian Gaming Brief portal (AGBrief), that the VIP game has not completely ended, and is therefore being subject to a new classification.
According to AGBrief, citing words from Ben Lee, “the mass game has incorporated the same echelon [of players] that was so openly criticized by the Government”, but that operators “are changing their focus to accommodate it”.
The analyst highlighted the “recent focus on transforming older, smaller hotel rooms into luxury options, with all operators understanding the need to achieve quality over quantity.”
However, he argued that “the focus on the luxury segment continues to create an impasse”, as “Macau has long focused on increasing the number of visitors in order to increase revenue”, but the business model “goes against the need to increase expenses per person.”
Ben Lee also warned that many tourists may, in fact, start to opt for other destinations with more affordable prices. The analyst argued that mass players “cannot be ignored”, as they continue to be “the main driver” of the sector. “Exorbitant hotel room prices could be a ‘dam’ to the increase in visitors”, as, as he suggested, “gamblers may go to other holiday spots, such as Thailand, if the price is not good”. This Asian country “is growing and is expected to overtake Singapore in terms of gross revenue”, at a time when the Thais are working on new gambling legislation.
“They hope to approve their gambling law in May next year. Assuming this happens, there are three to five years to build an integrated resort or development. They could be up and running considerably before Japan opens,” said Ben Lee.
Still in relation to the gaming market in Asia, the analyst highlighted that Asian bettors will focus on the future gaming markets of Thailand and Japan “while taking advantage of current offers in Macau, Singapore and the Philippines”, wrote AGBrief.</description><pubDate>2024-12-03 00:08:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Miguel Gomes, director: “Cinema is not a court”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/11/29/miguel-gomes-realizador-o-cinema-nao-e-um-tribunal/</link><description>Molly and Edward have a wedding scheduled, but when it's time to pick up the bride from the train, Edward decides to run away, starting the “Grand Tour” through Asia. The film is one of Miguel Gomes' films shown at the Film Festival between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries, which is running until December 13th, the day on which “Grand Tour” is shown.
 
He is one of the directors in focus at this film festival taking place in Macau. How do you feel about the opportunity to show your latest film, “Grand Tour”, in this region?
Being able to show the film anywhere in the world is always a goal for someone who wants to make films, as they only exist from the moment they are seen. The film has a relationship with Asia and China. It was bought for Hong Kong, and I don't know if it will be shown commercially in the territory and what the distributors' plans are. Regardless of this festival in Macau, the film will have visibility in that part of China.
The film is a tribute to old cinema, at least that's how I saw it.
No. I think that cinema does not need to be honored, because the history of cinema is a heritage that we honor by watching it. It is very important that this memory continues to be part of our lives and that the films can be shown. In Lisbon we are lucky to have a very competent and strong cinema library that fulfills this mission. Today's cinema is alive, despite not having as strong a social role as it did in the 20th century, and I don't think it needs tributes. “Grand Tour” is a film of today, but let's say it has the memory of other films that were made. I don't intend to pay homage to cinema, but rather to explore the potential it has, doing two very different things.
What are they?
One of them will, in fact, have to do with the history of cinema and its historical heritage, which I link to studio work. This is something that cinema has done a lot, inventing worlds that are not our real world. On the other hand, I wanted to capture reality, as cinema also has the potential to place the camera in front of people, film events, places and be able to record this.
When I refer to this homage to old cinema I am referring to the presence of a certain way of filming that was once in vogue. Did you want to mix old and contemporary cinematic elements?
I wanted to work with the manufactured Asia, which never existed, that cinema created.
With the Western view of Asia.
The vision that Americans and Europeans created. A large part of American cinema was invented by Europeans, people like [Josef von] Sternberg, who came from Germany and was the greatest example of a film author who worked with an image of romanticized Asia.
And he filmed in Macau, in fact. [The film “Macao”, from 1952]
Exactly. I wanted to work with this imaginary, trying to create a dialogue in which we could leave the studio and be in an Asia that corresponded to a colonial time in many of those countries, but that later, at other times, we could be in a present time. This time would be the future of the characters, in another post-colonial historical time.
“Grand Tour” was the name given to the route that many Westerners took to discover a certain Asia. To make the film, I assume some historical research was necessary. What was this process like?
I wouldn't call it very in-depth research, because that wasn't the objective. [The “Grand Tour”] is not a sociological film, it is a cinematic fantasy. It's more on that side than on the sociopolitical side, so to speak. The starting point was two pages from a travel book [the story ‘Mabel’, by W. Somerset Maugham], which gave us this itinerary. The situation described [in the story] corresponds to what we see in the film, with an engaged couple, with him living in Burma and her returning from London. He panics and runs away on the day he is supposed to pick her up from the Yangon pier. The couple then goes on this itinerary, and in the book she manages to catch her fiancé and they get married, but in the film it is different.
I assume it's difficult to compare films. But do you understand that the “Grand Tour” marks a turning point in your career compared to previous productions?
I don't think so. It's a personal film, like all the ones I've had the opportunity to make. It is personal in the sense that no limitations or specifications from the producer were imposed on me. I was able to do exactly what I wanted. I see common elements in this film to others I've made. I think it fits into a continuity of my work. Then there was the issue of the film's reception and the fact that it won an award in Cannes [for Best Director], which obviously helps me to continue working and have a more favorable reception at this moment.
It's a great recognition.
Before making this film, I was trying to make another one in Brazil, an adaptation of Euclides da Cunha's book, “Os Sertões”, and it is a complicated project, which involves a lot of production logistics. During the period when I was trying to make the film, it was difficult [to continue] for several reasons, and one of them is called Jair Bolsonaro [former President of the country]. Today we are resuming this process, of returning to the film. There was a time of discouragement, when I thought I had to give up on the project, and today the process of refinancing the film is moving much faster. The prospects are more encouraging.
Do you feel that the prize won at Cannes is also for Portuguese cinema?
I hope so. For my part, I have no doubt that what I do I owe to the efforts of other directors who filmed before me, and some of them continue to do so. They had to confront the characteristics of our market and society, they managed to film in a country where there is no industry because there is no market for it. They had to fight a lot to be able to film and make the films they made. I recognize an experience of identity in these films, I see myself in that, even though the films are all very different. There is, in fact, this identity in the history of Portuguese cinema, perhaps from the 60s onwards, with Cinema Novo, with producers and directors who fought hard to be able to film. They made films that, for me, are very important. Nowadays, with the system created by their struggle, it is easier for me and my colleagues than it would have been in the 60s and 70s.
Political conditions were also different, with less investment.
Political conditions changed over time, but their lives were not easy either after April 25, 1974. The way in which Portuguese cinema managed to impose itself and gain space for it to exist was fought in historical times and interlocutors different. And it was difficult.
Let’s go back to the “Grand Tour”. He said in an interview that the filming of the film was “surrealistic”. What moments do you highlight from this phase?
When I said that I was referring to a specific moment during the filming, in China, which was very surreal. This happened thousands of kilometers away, I was in Lisbon because I couldn't enter the country because of covid-19. After waiting two years to be able to film, I decided that the only way to make the film would be to have a Chinese team and me to be in Lisbon and shoot remotely. I was in an Airbnb in Areeiro, surrounded by monitors and discussing what should be filmed with the Chinese team. It was all very surrealistic then, yes.
Have you ever been afraid of not being able to capture the essence of the place, of Asian culture, taking into account all these conditions?
I thought the thing wouldn't work. I'm very suspicious of the technique, I'm very analog, and I didn't think it would work. To work, you had to have the image live, give an “action” and a “cut” in real time, so that you could have the general image, what was around the place in addition to the camera image. I needed to have a communication system that worked with the director of photography and the camera manager to be able to give him directions when we were filming. This was all possible, and I was amazed by it. On the other hand, the idea of ​​capturing the essence of the place, or something deeper in the culture of one of these countries, in this case China, seems like too heavy a burden to me. That wasn't my intention in the film, because it's impossible. I believe that a film is always the result of a negotiation between someone who looks and what exists to be looked at. There is a subjective side. What interests us, what appeals to us, what speaks to us and makes us want to film may exist in China, Vietnam, Africa or here on the café terrace where we are. I left for Asia like I left for the Arganil area to make a previous film, “That Dear Month of August”.
In a village.
Yes, a rural area of ​​Portugal, and I don't know if I would look at it differently in one situation or another. There is always something that I find beautiful or that touches me in different ways. What happens in “Grand Tour” is a series of disagreements, that of the couple, but it seems to me that there is also a disagreement between those European characters in their relationship with the territory. It seems that they are always disconnected from the space where they live. They live a bit in a bubble.
But colonialism was also a bit like that.
Yes. I agree, I think there are people who can see this in the film, this dissociation between what the characters are experiencing and what is happening around them. We often chose not to translate what was happening in front of them so that the Western viewer could be as intrigued and lost as the characters themselves. I also think that, nowadays, there is an idea, which I completely disagree with, that cinema exists to correct history and all the injustices in the world. It is also too heavy a task for cinema. It seems deeply inappropriate to me, because cinema is not a court to judge nor a space to punish spectators and characters, it is something else. Films don't have to be denunciations, prisoners of expectation. I tried to make a film where the colonial issue could be dealt with, but without having to punish either the spectators or the characters.
What was your relationship with Asia or your idea of ​​Orientalism?
I wanted to work on the idea that there was an Asia invented and manufactured by the European gaze, and I was aware that this existed and that I had to work with it in the film. The world of fiction, on the other hand, has as one of its aspects this idea of ​​exoticism, regardless of the sociological issue, of having had a Western look at the East, almost like a superficial view of that world. But fiction works with stereotypes, and that's not a bad thing. It's the cement to later do anything with these stereotypes.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion. , expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied this right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on staying, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of whipping, mutilation and death , systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
The gentlemen we are talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn how to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist popular organization and action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>After “very positive meeting”, Borges “looking forward to playing in a stadium” with Thompson</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/14/apos-encontro-muito-positivo-borges-ansioso-por-jogar-num-estadio-com-thompson/</link><description>Portuguese tennis player Nuno Borges made his debut yesterday, the 13th, in the 113th edition of the Australian Open, the first Major of the season, with a “very positive encounter” against Frenchman Alexandre Muller at Melbourne Park, where he will now face the Australian Jordan Thompson.
“I'm very happy. It was a very positive meeting. I think that, overall, I served very well, at least I managed to put the ball where I wanted and have a good percentage (69%). I felt like I remained pretty constant, except in the tie-break of the first set, which I didn't play very well. I always remained looking and very consistent during the meeting and that ended up being the key to the result”, he commented in statements to the Lusa agency.
The national number one and 33rd in the world needed two hours and 55 minutes to get the better of his French opponent, recently champion of the ATP 250 in Hong Kong, in four sets, 6-7 (2-7) , 6-3, 6-2 and 7-5, but he believes he deserved the triumph, on his return to Melbourne, where a year ago he became the first Portuguese tennis player to reach the round of 16.
“I feel like I deserved to win in four sets, I was slightly better from the first set onwards and I'm very happy. The first rounds are never easy in terms of sensations. Tennis doesn't flow in the same way, it's about trying to gain rhythm, but fortunately best-of-five-set matches give more time to find that rhythm. I feel like I finished the meeting quite well, even though it was also exhausting”, he explained.
After the victory in the opening round, Nuno Borges will “take the opportunity to rest and recover tomorrow to possibly play on Wednesday” with a home player, Jordan Thompson (27th ATP), who today beat the qualifier at the Margaret Court Arena German Dominik Koepfer also in four partials, by 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, 4-6 and 6-3.
“I hope it’s a good opportunity to play in a stadium possibly, I’m looking forward to it. We played a long time ago [Estoril Open 2021]. In 2024, he had a great season, quite impressive and I know that he, here in Australia, competes very well, always available to play five sets. I know that I will have to play my best tennis and I am waiting for another great challenge, perhaps even more challenging than today”, concluded Borges, winner of the only duel with Thompson.</description><pubDate>2025-01-14 16:15:44</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Luca Engstler is still recovering from the accident</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/12/gp-macau-luca-engstler-ainda-recupera-do-acidente/</link><description>Despite every year the Organizing Committee of the Macau Grand Prix puts a lot of resources and a lot of energy into the safety of drivers, the Guia Circuit continues, and will continue, to be one of the most dangerous and risky in the world. This year, the young German Luca Engstler, who participated in a GT3 car for the first time, felt the old maxim of this circuit firsthand: “you pay dearly for mistakes”
 
Eight weeks after the most serious accident of his career, the 24-year-old driver is still recovering from the unfortunate misfortune in the FIA ​​GT World Cup qualifying session at the 71st Macau Grand Prix. On Friday afternoon, with the clock ticking and when he was trying to improve his record, Luca Engstler lost control of his Lamborghini Huracán GT3 EVO in the dreaded Mandarin Curve, crashing at more than 230 km/h into the protective barriers. The car registered by Liqui Moly Team Engstler, but prepared and raced by the Grasser Racing Team, was completely destroyed and the German driver even fell unconscious after the impact.
“This is a unique event, the Lamborghini's pace was not very good and to be ahead we had to take more risks than the others. Basically, I went completely for it and was unsuccessful”, explained Luca Engstler, at the time, about the accident he suffered. Two months after what was “the most horrible day of my life to date”, the former German Touring Champion (TCR) is still in the recovery process.
“It was really a big impact”, recalled Luca Engstler, in conversation with the specialized portal Motorsport-Total.com, who needed a wheelchair after the accident. “The big problem was that my right ankle suffered a lot. I tore my lateral ligaments and had a lot of hemorrhages in my tibia and fibula, which caused some concern,” he recalled.
Returning to walking normally was also a great challenge for the young Lamborghini driver, who in the 2024 season impressively won two DTM races and participated for the first time in a GT3 car in Macau. “It took me a long time to be able to walk,” he recalled. “For the first two or three days, I was actually in a wheelchair, because I simply couldn’t do anything and all my bones hurt,” Engstler described to his country’s publication, noting that “I had bruises everywhere and everything was difficult ”.
Recovering
Even so, Lucas Engstler, at the end of the day of the accident, already at the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário, made a post on social media stating that everything was fine. The driver, who was in Macau accompanied by his father, Franz Engstler — also a driver and a well-known figure in Asian motorsport — wanted to reassure those closest to him. Two days after the accident, he appeared on the starting grid of the FIA ​​GT World Cup on Sunday, without crutches, only slightly supported by an umbrella.
“What was important to me was not wanting to make a big deal about it,” he explained to the German portal. “In the end, the accident seemed very serious, but that just shows how safe the cars are,” he highlighted.
The pilot continues to recover from the after-effects of the strong impact. He took advantage of the winter break to take a motorhome trip to Sweden with his best friend. “Everything is going well”, he stated, clarifying that he is now able to run. “I’d say I’m at 95 percent and have no permanent damage.”
After the accident, the German worked on his recovery in the Allgäu region, in his homeland, “with some acquaintances, who are physiotherapists and doctors. I received excellent assistance.”
Return soon
Luca Engstler admits he became impatient during the recovery process. “They told me that I would only be able to do sport again at the beginning of February, but of course I couldn't accept that”, acknowledging that he started training earlier than recommended.
Fortunately for Luca Engstler, the DTM only starts on the last weekend of April. In the near future, the driver plans to get behind the wheel again, possibly in a rental kart to begin with. The aim is to be in shape for the start of pre-season and preparation tests for the popular German championship, scheduled for mid-February and early March.
Regarding the Macau Grand Prix, two days after the accident, Luca Engstler was very clear: “I told everyone that my objective is to return and try to fight for victory in this great race.”</description><pubDate>2025-01-12 23:43:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorsport | Rui Valente does not give up</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/automobilismo-rui-valente-nao-se-da-por-vencido/</link><description>Rui Valente will return this year for another season of motorsport in the region. The longest-serving Macau driver maintains the same motivation and will compete in the Macau Roadsport Challenge, the Touring Car competition organized by the General Automobile Association of Macau-China (AAMC), as well as the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix , in November
 
With the same enthusiasm that has been recognized for decades, Rui Valente will again drive, in the 2025 season, a Subaru BRZ, the same car he competed in at the Guia Circuit, last November, in the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. In the race held at the territory's event, the Portuguese driver finished in sixth place, after losing some positions at the start, where he dropped to tenth. The result was not even better because the race, held in the rain, ended prematurely due to an accident by an opponent.
In the competition for local drivers, which currently combines starting grids with more than fifty cars, all of them Toyota GR86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8), Rui Valente admitted to HM that he “will not give up”, further revealing who “misses being on the podium, both in China and in Macau…”.
The Premium Racing Team driver had, at the last Macau Grand Prix, one of the fastest cars in terms of top speed in the field of his race. Therefore, the focus for this year will be on other technical aspects of the car that go beyond the engine.
“At this point, I just wanted to increase the diameter of the front wheels and widen the track to improve the car’s behavior in curves”, he confided to HM, also mentioning that he intends to “optimize weight transmission during braking for the curve and the respective exit". These improvements, together with updates to the braking system, should increase the Japanese machine's competitiveness in a fierce grid, made up of drivers from Macau, Hong Kong and Mainland China, with cars in constant evolution.
Indefinite calendar
The calendar of events for the automobile competition organized by AAMC has not yet been revealed. In 2024, the Macau Roadsport Challenge debuted at the Zhuzhou International Circuit, in eastern Hunan province, but Rui Valente would prefer the competition to return this year to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC), in Zhaoqing.
“I would really like to return to GIC, because I have everything there”, says the Portuguese pilot, defender of the track located in the neighboring province. “When you go to a qualifying race, for those who do four races and then Macau, if you are at a track that you already know, like GIC, where you have been riding for seven or more years, every time you enter the track and try to do better than which last time means you are improving and perfecting your driving. This way, you immediately know that you are stronger that year for Macau.”
On the other hand, for the experienced driver from the territory, “if you go to a new track, like the Zhuzhou circuit, in addition to going there to learn the new route and improve your time, you will never know if you are really stronger to Macau, as you know when you race in the GIC.”
As in past seasons, the Macau Roadsport Challenge calendar is expected to consist of two weekends, with two races each, which will also serve as qualifying for the Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:47:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Tennis | Nuno Borges will play against Alcaraz at the Australian Open</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/16/tenis-nuno-borges-vai-jogar-frente-a-alcaraz-no-open-da-australia/</link><description>Nuno Borges overcame his nervousness on Wednesday to defeat Australian Jordan Thompson, in three sets, in the second round of the Australian Open, and will now face 'Carlitos' Alcaraz without pressure, the Portuguese tennis player admitted to the Lusa agency.
“I feel like it was a good game on my part. Without a doubt, it was better than the first round, the sensations were there”, he began by analyzing the national number one, speaking to the Lusa agency, after advancing to the third round of the first Grand Slam of the season.
The 27-year-old Maiato, on Wednesday, contradicted the favoritism of 'local' Jordan Thompson, 27th seed, prevailing with scores of 6-3, 6-2 and 6-4, in one hour and 47 minutes, in a packed John Cain Arena – the third most important court at Melbourne Park.
“I was quite nervous, it was a big stadium, it doesn't happen every day [that happens], so I think that within that I managed to play a very good game and I'm really happy with the result”, he pointed out.
Head to Alcaraz
Semi-finalist in Auckland at the start of the year, Borges has now extended his good form, setting up a meeting in the third round with Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, third player in the world.
“Now, against ‘Carlitos’, there’s not much to say. Everyone knows what he is capable of and everything he has done, [he is] quite famous all over the world, there is not much to highlight”, he declared about his opponent who, in Australia, seeks to become the youngest tennis player (he is 21 years old) completing a career Grand Slam.
Against the Spaniard, the 33rd ranked player in the ATP rankings will try to do his best and “make him as uncomfortable as possible”. “I'm going to play without pressure, try not to put too many expectations in my head to see if I can bring my best tennis”, he concluded.
Last year, Nuno Borges, who is yet to begin his journey in the doubles table alongside Francisco Cabral, became the first Portuguese tennis player to reach the round of 16 at the Australian Open.</description><pubDate>2025-01-16 22:38:03</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Maro Engel clarified the GT World Cup episode</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/10/gp-macau-maro-engel-esclareceu-episodio-da-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>Maro Engel won, in a race not suitable for those with heart failure, the FIA ​​GT World Cup at the 71st Macau Grand Prix. However, the German's fourth victory among us was anything but peaceful. Maro Engel took advantage of an interview with the German magazine Motorsport Aktuell to explain what happened on the streets of the territory and which earned him so much criticism
 
The German driver, who will turn 40 years old this year, had a 2024 season full of success: he won the GT World Challenge Europe, was the best of the Mercedes-AMG representatives in the DTM and achieved a fourth triumph in the Grand Prix of Macao. However, Maro Engel prefers not to highlight a single achievement in his dream 2024 season, having told his country's specialized magazine that “in terms of prestige, the victory in Macau has to be highlighted. But honestly, I don't want to highlight a single moment as the greatest achievement of this incredible year. I worked hard to achieve all these successes.”
In the Macao SAR, the Bavarian driver's triumph was offered on a platter when the race's top two finishers, Antonio Fuoco (Ferrari) and Raffaele Marciello (BMW), clashed while braking for Curva Lisboa with two laps to go. However, Maro Engel had already been involved in another incident, when, at the start of the race, at Isso da Solão, his Mercedes-AMG GT3 made a subtle contact with the rear of Dries Vanthoor's BMW, which was ahead of him in third position. The young Belgian was thrown against the barriers, ending up retiring due to damage to the M4 GT3's suspension, while Maro Engel would see the checkered flag in first place, with an advantage of 11 seconds.
At the end of the race, the College of Sports Commissioners decided that the mentioned touch deserved a 5-second penalty, which had no impact on the final result, leading the head of BMW Motorsport, Andreas Roos, to tell the press that the incident “ was not penalized appropriately.” Dries Vanthoor, who was also a contender for victory, went further and said at the time that when “you push another car off the track, you shouldn't be able to win the race.”

It wasn't on purpose
Maro Engel's aggressive style was criticized at the time, but the driver, who made his debut winning in Macau in 2014, prefers to emphasize that “he does everything within the limits of fair play” and believes it is “difficult to accuse a driver of not trying everything to win there (in Macau).” In the situation in question, Maro Engel wanted to clarify that “it was clearly faster. In the wide part of the circuit, at the bottom, I had no chance of attacking, so I tried at the top. It ended up going wrong, and that wasn't my intention. I apologized to Dries later. In general, I race to win. The day I no longer give it my all, I'll hang up my helmet. I’m definitely not here to make new friends.”
Despite the “musical chairs” between the car manufacturers involved in the GT3 class this pre-season, Maro Engel will continue to defend the colors of Mercedes-AMG, something he has done since 2008, and will naturally be one of the Stuttgart brand's choices for the World Cup in November, at the Guia Circuit. The Munich-born driver doesn’t see himself retiring from the track anytime soon, as “I haven’t reached my peak yet and I continue to find pleasure in racing.”
On his CV, in races held in Macau, Maro Engel has two victories in the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup (2015 and 2024) and another two in the Macau GT Cup (2014 and 2022), but promises not to stop here.</description><pubDate>2025-01-10 06:21:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Football | Guangzhou FC dissolved due to excessive debt</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/08/futebol-guangzhou-fc-dissolvido-por-excesso-de-endividamento/</link><description>Guangzhou FC, the football club with the most titles in China, was dissolved yesterday due to excessive debt, suffering the same fate as dozens of clubs in the country, after years of exuberance.
Formerly known as Guangzhou Evergrande, the club was unable to meet the Chinese Football Association's financial requirements needed to compete in the 2025 season.
“Due to the heavy financial burden resulting from previous seasons, the club was unable to pay all debts within the deadline,” Guangzhou said in a statement. “We express our sincere apologies and thank all fans for their understanding and forgiveness,” he added.
After being acquired by property developer Evergrande in 2010, the club went on a spending spree in China that made headlines around the world.
Helped by players like Brazilian international Paulinho and elite coaches like Italian Marcello Lippi and former Portuguese national team coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, Guangzhou won eight Chinese Super League titles, the pinnacle of football in China, between 2011 and 2019. The team also triumphed in the Asian Champions League in 2013 and 2015.
However, in 2021, Evergrande recorded debts of more than 300 billion dollars and, as key players left the club due to financial problems, it was relegated to China's second tier in 2022.</description><pubDate>2025-01-08 02:01:40</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
