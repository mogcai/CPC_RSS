"I am horrified by the open use of genocidal rhetoric and the shameful dehumanization of Palestinians by senior Israeli employees," said Volker Türk at the opening of the 60th UN Human Rights Council session in Geneva.
The High Commissioner has called for "immediate actions to end the carnage," stating that the international community "is failing in its duty."
“We are failing with the people of Gaza. Where are the decisive measures to prevent genocide? Why are countries not doing more to prevent these atrocious crimes?” He said.
"The region calls for peace. Gaza is a cemetery," said Volker Türk.
The Palestinian territory, besieged by Israel, is devastated and suffering from hunger, according to the UN. The Israeli Army, which claims to control approximately 75 percent of the Gaza Strip and 40 percent of the city of Gaza, indicated its intention to take the latter, the largest city in the north of the Enclave.
The Israeli offensive was launched in the Gaza Strip in response to an attack on Israelite soil on October 7, 2023 by the Palestinian Islamite group Hamas.
Action
"The Palestinian civilian massacres in Gaza by Israel; indescribable suffering and inflicted mass destruction; the obstruction of the supply of adequate humanitarian aid and the consequent hunger of civilians; the murders of journalists, UN employees and non-governmental organizations (NGO), and the warfare crimes," said Türk.
The High Commissioner has called for countries to “interrupt the flow of weapons to Israel, risking infringing war laws;“ to exercise maximum pressure to ensure a ceasefire, the release of hostages and arbitrarily detained people; and the entry of sufficient humanitarian aid in Gaza by all means at his disposal. ”
Türk pediu ainda que a comunidade internacional tome “medidas decisivas para se oporem à tomada militar de Gaza planeada por Israel e à anexação acelerada da Cisjordânia ocupada”. Logo após o regresso do Presidente norte-americano, Donald Trump, à Casa Branca, Israel, tal como os Estados Unidos, deixou de participar nos debates perante o Conselho dos Direitos Humanos.</description><pubDate>2025-09-09 00:09:39</pubDate></item><item><title>QingMao | More than 100 million crossings in four years</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/qingmao-mais-de-100-milhoes-de-travessias-em-quatro-anos/</link><description>In four years, Qingmao's border was used for over 100 million Macao border crossings and the interior.

Despite the few damage, classes and public services were suspended throughout the day, and four injured were recorded. This was the ninth tropical cyclone to affect Macau this year, a total that has not been seen for over 30 years
 
About 20 minutes after the emission of Storm signal 8, due to the passage of the Tapah Tropical Cyclone by Macao, the direction of Youth Education and Development Services indicated that children's, primary, secondary and special teachings would be suspended yesterday. About 25 minutes earlier, the Civil Protection Operations Center declared the immediate prevention state, in anticipation of the arrival of Signal 8 of Tropical Storm issued at 9 pm on Sunday, which was only raised yesterday at 3 pm.
Also signal 8 would remain raised for 18 hours, completely paralyzing Macao in this week's start. Tapah was the ninth tropical cyclone to pass through Macau this year. The last time nine tropical storms affected the territory in the same year was in 1993.
Late yesterday morning, administration and civil service services announced that “public administration services and entities are closed in the afternoon and their services are suspended” due to the maintenance of signal 8 until 3 pm yesterday.
However, as it is natural, the Public Security Police Corps, the Fire Department, the Judiciary Police, Customs Services and the Emergency Services of the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center (including the islands urgent post) continued to provide emergency services to citizens.
Following the example of MSAR Public Administration services, the Portuguese Consulate General in Macao and Hong Kong ended the public service services yesterday throughout the day.
"We will come into contact with all users to reset the calls, so that if possible all are marked by the end of this week," was added in a post on the consulate's Facebook page, which also appealed to the Portuguese communities of Macau and Hong Kong, to follow the "recommendations of the authorities about the care to be observed while alert signs are issued."
Between one point and another
Public transport was also severely affected by the Tapah cyclone, with the authorities decreing the suspension of circulation, which was only raised after 3 pm yesterday, with the reduction of the alert to signal 3.
Prior to the restart of public transport circulation, customs services launched an appeal to residents, tourists and workers "to enter Macao in a phase, collaborate with the instructions of the border post staff and use the means of public transport in an orderly manner." Despite the appeal, as soon as the buses began to circulate, long lines were formed in stops at the busiest points, such as Ferreira do Amaral Square and Barra da Barra.
From the moment the gradual standardization of traffic took place, the authorities reopened the four bridges that connect Macau to the mud.
With the entry into force of signal 3, public buses resumed the operation, the light meter circular again, as well as the special taxis and the buses between the Macao border post and Hong Kong International Airport. Turbojet ferries resumed the ligaures between Macau and Hong Kong at 2:30 pm (Sheung Wan's departure) and 16h (Macao's departure).

Authorities were called for 11 cases of construction/lamp/tree removal at risk of falling and 13 cases of plaster removal, claim, window, awning or other objects at risk of falling or already fallen. In addition, there was a request from a person withheld in a elevator.
In the aftermath of operations late yesterday afternoon, Secretary for Security, Wong Sio Chak, revealed four injured due to the tropical cyclone, three of which light and one that forced hospitalization due to a bone fracture.
Until 14h, with the reduction of storm alert on the horizon, 13 people had appealed to emergency host centers since they opened doors.
Between 07h and 08h in the morning, some areas of the inner port and mud were affected by slight floods, which led some stores not to open and protect entry with full protection bars, but in other shops and restaurants the operations took place without changes.
At about 8 am yesterday, the tropical cyclone was at the closest point of Macau, about 110 kilometers, as it moved calmly, about 20 kilometers per hour to the city of Taishan, from Guangdong province, progressively moving away from the territory. Also the wind was gradually weakening.
However, Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) warned of the possibility of strong, thunder and wind with strong gusts due to the influence of Tapah's external rainfall. This influence led the authorities to issue the Blue Storm Warning at 10am, the lowest of flood notices, which predicts the water level above the lower half pavement. Still, "the astronomical tide in combination with Storm comes up, raised the water level about 1 meter maximum height and the registered tide was 3.7 meters."
In the summary of the SMG, it was indicated that Tapah was a challenge in predictability due to its "small circulation, winding trajectory and proximity to Macau".
Regarding the state of time in the coming days, SMGs predicted yesterday the continuation of instability this morning with sometimes strong and thunder, due to the influence of rain bands associated with the cyclone. Sywhellars and thunderstorms should continue tomorrow, with the sun to return to the skies of Macao from Wednesday and staying during the weekend.
Operations Center
Two hours before signal 8, the Chief Executive chaired a meeting at the Civil Protection Operations Center (COPC), to be aware of preparations to respond to the Tapah tropical cyclone, and the reaction plans of the various departments and institutions.

"The chief executive also said that due to the successive passage of tropical cyclones through Macao, in recent months, the structure of civil protection has maintained his warning continuously and has done numerous preparation works of immediate reaction against storms," ​​which is why he thanked constant commitment and work.
The ruler called for special attention to the response to flooding by monitoring the low zones, ensuring the normal functioning of drainage systems and preparing evacuation plans if the conditions on the ground for this require. Situation that did not occur. In addition, it required that the uninterrupted supply of water and electricity were ensured.

Live
The Commander General of Unit Police Services (SPU), Leong Man Cheong, was yesterday protagonist of the gaffe of the day, motivating the sharing of humorous publications on social networks. Addressing to the population to appeal to a preventive stance against the passage of the Tapah tropical cyclone to Macau, Leong Man Cheong stated the opposite of what he wanted to convey. "The Civil Protection Operations Center appeals to residents and tourists who, during the eight sign of typhoon, please avoid as much as possible at home, or in interior and safe spaces." Later, SPU's commissioner, Kam Chit Soi, said his colleague had a lapse during the live broadcast and apologized, correcting the Civil Protection Operations Center and appealing to the population to stay at home or shelter in interior and insurance spaces.</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 23:54:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Patio do Espinho | Defended building demolition</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/patio-do-espinho-defendida-demolicao-de-predio/</link><description>Representative Leong Hong considers that it is necessary to preserve the “traditional historical constructions” of the territory. However, the executive refuses that the demolished building falls into this category, because it has not been classified
 
The government defended the demolition of a building in paragraph 10 of the Patio do Espinho, after the fall of part of the structure facade. The position was taken through the response to a written interpellation of Deputy Leong Hong Sai, linked to the residents of Macao.
In questioning, the legislator addressed the case to defend the need to ensure that urban renewal in the city is put into practice, while legislation is produced to ensure that “traditional historical constructions, in favor of maintaining the city's history and cultural ties”.
In the response, signed by the director of the Soil Services and Urban Construction Directorate (DSSCU), Lai Weng Leong, the executive defends the demolition, considering that the infrastructure was not protected, which removes conservation obligations. This option was taken after the Cultural Institute (IC) was heard.
"Building number 10 located in Travessa Três do Pátio do Espinho, after its collapse, was classified as being imminent in ruin and, after consulted the opinion of the IC, DSSCU proceeded, for public security reasons, to its demolition on August 8, 2025, which is currently completed," he was explained. "The IC stated that the aforementioned building is not part of the classified real estate, and these types of constructions must be regulated by the respective legal regulation in force on normal urban constructions," he was added.
More than 600
Lai Weng Leong also quotes the data provided by the IC to indicate that the “current 165 macao -classified real estate items” are related to “more than 600 buildings”.
At the same time, the IC also denies having responsibilities in the degrading state of the demolished building, as it is not part of the supervised heritage, as it is not protected. "Over the years, the IC is always based on the Cultural Heritage Settlement Law, having proceeded, each semester of the year, the verification and supervision of the security of ancient cultural relics in Macao, seeking to learn about their general preservation status and successfully stimulate and stimulate the owners to perform the necessary maintenance work," was justified.
Regarding maintenance work by the owners, it is explained that the IC has a support service for private ones when they do works in their protected heritage have guidelines for “maintenance of outer appearance”, through the issuance of “technical opinions”, but also other supports “to perform restoration and maintenance works”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Great Consumption Award | Trade revenues increase 10%</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/grande-premio-do-consumo-receitas-do-comercio-aumentam-10/</link><description>Although traders highlight the increase in revenues and the number of customers, the program continues to deserve criticism from consumers, as discounts cannot be used during weekdays
 
On the first weekend to use the discount valleys issued within the latest round of the major consumption award, traders said revenues grew around 10 percent. The numbers were pointed out by several traders in statements cited by the newspaper or Mun.
To the Chinese language newspaper, the owner of an unidentified bakery acknowledged that usually on the weekend sales volume is negatively affected by residents' travels to the interior of China. However, due to the discount program that can be used for purchases, the owner stated that the weekend revenues showed 10 percent growth, compared to periods without discounts.
The owner also indicated that, to take advantage of discounts, the store tries to have its own more attractive promotions, and also with the launch of new products, which is expected to arouse greater interest from customers.
In turn, the first -need product store manager indicated that the latest discounts contributed to the number of people to visit the space to increase by about 20 percent.
However, he explained that people opt for the most necessary goods, without major expenses, such as toilet paper or personal and cleaning products for the home. Also in this case, success is not only attributed to the discounts of the initiative promoted by the government, the store also offers more attractive prices.
More flexibility
Despite the satisfaction of merchants, consumer levels arise as requests for greater flexibility, thinking of people with less economic capacity. In the Macao Macao Forum program of Macao's Chinese channel of some listeners to ask for more flexibility on time and in the use of discount coupons.
A nickname Chan listener pointed out that the fact that coupons can only be used on the weekend is negative, because it always creates lines in the most popular stores. Chan considered that the experience of using discounts is bad, and that it should be possible to use discounts during the days of the week.
Chan argued not to understand the resistance to make minor adjustments, according to the opinions of consumers, as several rounds of the program have already been performed.
Another nickname listener Leong suggested the use of coupons on Friday. However, Leong warned the authorities to the possibility of the program leading to increased inflation in local commerce, so he requested an increase in prices by the authorities.
In turn, a listener of nickname Law indicated that the program promoted by the government fails to think of people with less financial capacity. Law has exemplified that for students and the elderly it is difficult to use 200 -Patacas discount coupons because this value can only be used when at least 600 patacas spend.</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 23:45:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Campaign advances for the last days to the “Mpop” style</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/eleicoes-campanha-avanca-para-os-ultimos-dias-ao-estilo-mpop/</link><description>The elections for the Legislative Assembly are scheduled for the 14th, so the election campaign is almost over. In a report by Lusa agency, there are details of the “MPOP” style of the election campaign, with a lot of music and requests for financial support to the mixture
 
Crowded audience, all dressed in the gowns on the list with which they compete for the elections on the 14th; Chinese drums next to the stage and above candidates and supporters, various microphones, music and choreography. This is the campaign for Macao legislatures, in a style that can be called "MPOP".
The microphones change hands, reproducing the same slogans with different voices, in short and acute scales, which end almost all in a party instruction. At this point, the drums are listened to loudly and the audience reproduces the last note heard, while shaking the political 'merchandising' that is handed over to the start of the rally: plastic hands to clap, numbers on the list with led lights, malleable straws, fans, all with the same color.
Campaign actions in Macao, restricted to the last two weeks before legislative elections for the local parliament, do not contain speeches in the events of the six lists that will elect 14 of the 33 deputies to the Legislative Assembly (AL).
The remaining 12 candidates are chosen through the associations, through the indirect suffrage, and there are still seven deputies appointed by the Chief Executive, in this case Sam Hou Fai.
Describing campaign events is like an exercise of musical shows, namely the genus "Kpop", among the lists led by younger candidates, or the genre "pop old-myle", as if it was figures like Elvis or Olivia Newton John Risen.
The concentrations are made up of the members of the lists and the people mobilized by them, some and the other dresses with the same uniforms. But there are no politicians on stage and viewers listening to them.
In these events, politicians seem to be assumed as artists, but there are no audiences, because they seem to be part of the choreography. Finally, there are very few people besides and each other, that is, people watching who are not directly linked to the lists.
Abstention is the great ghost that hangs over the whole process, which takes place for the first time under the framework of the new Electoral Law of April 2024, which aims to "reinforce the implementation of the" Macao Macao governed by Patriotas "principle.
Economic challenges
Ilia Chou, 40, an employee of the financial sector, was with a child and a friend watching one of these rallies and seemed to be one of those few people present not involved in the campaign list. He agreed to talk to Lusa after he had spoken to another microphone.
Ilia was attracted to the list that was there because those people have a "young and community aspect" and are concerned with "offering prospects for progress" to young people. "Given the current challenging economic climate, we face a critical question: our young people now have fewer options than before. This specific aspect is what attracts me most in this initiative," he said.
But “other groups also talk about youth and employment, what are the differences? Why do you like this particular group?” We asked. "I don't know them [the other groups]. Well, I was attracted to the charming characters of this list," he replied. "I think these four characters quite charming," Ilia added, they talk about "love, the title is very charming, and the color is pink, it looks very welcoming."
Political programs are, without exception, lists of requests to an “provider father”, incarnated by the executive, who has the responsibility of managing a comfortable and growing financial reserve, fueled by taxes paid by the six game dealers in Macao.
The numbers show this comfort. In August, the Macao Financial Reserve, which was always growing throughout the first half, reached 647.3 billion patacas, and was applied in subcontracted investments, deposits, current accounts, and credit securities.
Lists want to be applied to initiatives such as the creation of a development fund and the reversal of 10 percent profits for distribution by all citizens, want to increase pensions or more money in consumer coupons, subsidies and maternity licenses, want more social housing, want free health and higher education, or simply require greater annual money distribution.
Masses for the masses
There are also other demands, such as promoting the diversification of the economy, measures to support the transformation and modernization of small and medium enterprises or intelligent city development, but the most significant part of the six lists programs points directly to the distribution of money from the government in the most varied forms.
The other recipients of the requests are the game dealers, to which the candidates go with warnings that they are determined to defend the priority of residents in access to the best paid jobs.
Macao's unemployment rate is 2 percent and permanent residents at 2.6 percent. That is, technically, Macau has full employment. However, as Lusa told a candidate, the employment issue has nothing to do with statistics, it just holds on with "perception."
And in fact the question of unemployment, especially those who have just graduated, is a pressing issue of political programs, as HM indicated. This is the case of the first list to compete for direct suffrage, the “Association of United Citizens of Macao”, which is led by Song Pek Kei, a deputy linked to the Fujian community, who took the first steps in politics alongside businessman Chan Meng Kam.
The list led by the deputy asks, for example, the creation of a share for residents in all professional areas, “support for employment and local companies”, and the guarantee that “85 percent, or more, employees are local residents”.
The Nova Esperança list, led by José Pereira Coutinho, and one of the few macanese participants in these elections, asks for “employment for all”, a slogan present in his electoral program where the “employment priority for Macao's permanent residents is promised at game dealers”.
Who goes out to their
List campaigns for indirect suffrage may seem more discreet, but that doesn't mean there is no news. After investing in Global Media, Portugal, and betting on the real estate area, in Porto, Kevin Ho, the nephew of the first chief executive, Edmund Ho, bet on local politics, when entering the list “Union of Macao Business Interests”, led by José Chui Sa Peng. Also he is familiar, in this case, from a previous head of the Executive of MSAR, Chui Sai On, already removed from the political scene.
In the case of these lists, representative of the sectors of labor, culture, education or business interests, employment is a concern, but what the candidates are looking for is a government that can support companies and finally diversify the economy.
Thus, in the “union of business interests of Macao”, it is advocated “support for digital and high technology transformation to modernize traditional industries and develop emerging sectors”. Candidates promise to play the role of intermediaries between those who have difficulty maintaining in this business fabric and the executive by “listening carefully to the difficulties and claims of the commercial and financial industries, especially small and medium enterprises”. The names of the seven appointed deputies are not yet known, as the Chief Executive's choice is usually made public only after the elections.

"I am horrified by the open use of genocidal rhetoric and the shameful dehumanization of Palestinians by senior Israeli employees," said Volker Türk at the opening of the 60th UN Human Rights Council session in Geneva.
The High Commissioner has called for "immediate actions to end the carnage," stating that the international community "is failing in its duty."
“We are failing with the people of Gaza. Where are the decisive measures to prevent genocide? Why are countries not doing more to prevent these atrocious crimes?” He said.
"The region calls for peace. Gaza is a cemetery," said Volker Türk.
The Palestinian territory, besieged by Israel, is devastated and suffering from hunger, according to the UN. The Israeli Army, which claims to control approximately 75 percent of the Gaza Strip and 40 percent of the city of Gaza, indicated its intention to take the latter, the largest city in the north of the Enclave.
The Israeli offensive was launched in the Gaza Strip in response to an attack on Israeli soil on October 7, 2023 by the Palestinian Islamite group Hamas.
Action
"The Palestinian civilian massacres in Gaza by Israel; indescribable suffering and inflicted mass destruction; the obstruction of the supply of adequate humanitarian aid and the consequent hunger of civilians; the murders of journalists, UN employees and non-governmental organizations (NGO), and the warfare crimes," said Türk.

From the 24th of this month, three more projects will be inaugurated: “Hands borrowed”, “goods and warriors” and “non -terminal”. The first is at the D. Pedro V Theater, the rest lead to reflections and interactions between Rua da Tercena and Macau Centro Square
 
In September there is still time and space to enjoy the new exhibitions that “Art Macau - International Art Biennial of Macau 2025” brings to the territory. From the 24th onwards, three projects integrated in the “Exhibition of Public Art”, subordinate to the theme “Waves and Paths”, are presented to the public.
These are five pieces or sets of works by nine artists, entitled “Hands borrowed”, “goods and warriors” and “non-terminal”.
In addition, also on September 24, between 19h and 8:30 pm, the “Conversation and Dialogue: The Public Nature of Public Art” colloquium in the Auditorium of the Macao Art Museum, which features Wu Wei, co-curator of the Biennial, and artists Ann Hamilton, Yin Xiuzhen, Jason Ho and Assemblis Gang.
The lecture will focus on “on ways of cultivating a new, dynamic and vibrant approach in the context of 'face -to -face' public art”. Registration takes place until September 19th on the Macao Single Account platform.
Ann Hamilton, an American artist, is the name behind one of the new projects on display, “Hands borrowed”, patent at the D. Pedro V Theater. This artist is, according to a note from the Cultural Institute (IC), “internationally recognized for its large-scale multimedia facilities, public projects and their performance collaborations”. In Macao the artist recreates “The Historical Memory of Sino-West Trade with Multimedia Art”.
Interactive paths
Another of the artists participating in the Colloquium, Yin Xiuzhen, is considered a “renowned Chinese contemporary artist”. It presents in Macao the “non -terminal”, an interactive video installation patent in the square of the Cultural Center of Macau (CCM).
This installation, which can be seen until December 12, focuses on a “static luggage treadmill” made of metal, wood and rubber, forming an interactive platform, where the public can rest, move and socialize.
Through the treadmill, there are plastic rugs where the audience can run, skateboard and bike. The nine screens hanging above the installation display live images of the place and scenes of pre-recorded life, and the audience can also send their own videos to create a lively theater of life together. “This work transforms cultural spaces and artistic scenes into an experimental field for social behavior, highlighting the idea that the journey of life and art has no end and suggesting the fluidity of life, memory and identity,” describes the IC.
THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE
Finally, the British Interdisciplinary Assembly Collective, known for revitalizing urban spaces through community and creative design, presents “goods and warriors”, a project that “serves to reflect on the relationship between land and people”.
Available at Number 19 of Tercena Street in Macao, this project “examines the current developments of small -scale agriculture in China and the UK, using video facilities and micronarrative techniques to directly present scenes of daily life and work in small farms in both regions”.
Thus, it is exploited “the symbiotic relationship between earth and humanity through the display of documents and the holding of public events, thus creating an emotional connection between Earth and the public of Macao”, describes the IC.
With “goods and warriors”, it presents a “upward perspective” of the connection of agriculture with people and the “unique value of the small-scale agricultural economy for ecological balance, community resilience and economic stability, challenging the preconceived idea of ​​'urban centrism' and also re-examining the construction role of rural practices in the construction of a sustainable future”.
“Goods and Warriors” is also available for public visit until December 12 this year, aiming to “establish a link between land, food and human senses and develop a new dialogue between the urban audience and the agricultural landscapes that nourish it, at the same time offering a visual validation for the cultural value and the survival wisdom necessary for future urban development in the growing uncertain uncertainties of globalization”.</description><pubDate>2025-09-09 00:03:13</pubDate></item><item><title>BRICS | Xi Jinping participates in Virtual Summit</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/09/brics-xi-jinping-participa-em-cimeira-virtual/</link><description>China confirmed the participation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, in an extraordinary virtual summit of the Brics Emerging Block, which took place yesterday and was summoned by Brazilian homologous, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

Costa</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/sara-f-costa/</link><description>Qui yuan and the ecstasy of exile
There are trips that only poetry allows, inner displacements that cross time and space and illuminate zones of our own memory. When we evoke Qui Yuan (屈原), minister and poet of the former state of Chu, in the fourth century BC, the image that rises before us is that of a lonely man walking by the millet river, declaiming verses impregnated with pain and restlessness, in a succession of steps that would inevitably lead him to the extreme gesture of throwing into waters. The legend went through more than two millennia, but it was the word that guaranteed her immortality, inscribing her voice in the deepest texture of Chinese literature.
The history of Chinese poetry is, to a large extent, the history of its response to the world in crisis. De Que Yuan, who sings exile as an ethical gesture and throws himself into the river, the poets Ming and Qing, who seek reunion with tradition in a ruined landscape, poetry emerges as refuge, resistance and reinvention. This essay runs through this crossing - between dragons and wine jars - to show how literary language remains, even in the darker times, a gesture of rescue of dignity and beauty.
Illustrations of "li sao"
In “lioso” (離騷, encounter with suffering), the experience of exile and political abandonment becomes one of the most intense spiritual trips of world literary history, where the poet's inner topography is confused with the mythical geography of the text. Its lament is not just personal: it echoes the tension between individual ethics and collective decay, the attempt to save a homeland by the purity of language. The poem, long and metamorphic, makes imagination a territory of resistance: Qui yuan wears orchids as if they were armor, reaps sacred plants to read fate, rides dragons and summons fenixes to accompany him. Reading li is means accepting the invitation to inhabit an injunction where myth and memory are mutually reflected, a territory where the intimate and cosmic are confused. The ancient illustrations of “Li Sao Tu” (離騷圖), recorded by Xiao Yuncong at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, extend a well -known crossing of Chinese poetry, between the word and the image. In them, the poet appears immersed in enhanced landscapes, surrounded by rivers, mountains, spirits, dragons and flowers; Each trace of paint seems to respond to the rhythm of the poem's breath, not as a simple visual complement, but as an extension of the poetic experience itself. The engraving gives body to the unspeakable, crystallizing in a visible matter the error of the spirit that the text calls.
Perhaps this is why, more than two thousand years later, the name of Que Yuan continues to be invoked every year at the Dragon Boat Festival (Duanwu Jie 端午節). In the rivers of China, thousands of boats cross the waters, the Zòngzi are prepared and shared, the families gather to remember the poet who chose the word before silence. The rite perpetuates memory, the gesture becomes language, and poetry continues to cross time, calling us to a journey where the human recognizes himself in the Universal, where the wound of loss becomes the beauty of permanence.
駕八龍之婉婉兮 ， 載雲旗之委蛇。
忽臨睨夫舊鄉兮 ， 僕夫悲余馬懷。
“I conduct the eight dragons with soft elegance,
The cloud flags wave like dance snakes.
Suddenly glimpse my land in the distance,
And the coachman saddens, and the horse sighs longing. ” (my translation)
This excerpt from the extensive work is a moment of inflection on the visionary route of the poetic self, when, in the course of an ascension guided by celestial forces and wrapped in an intensely mythical image, the look turns - suddenly - to the past, or rather, to the land of origin, the lost homeland, which serves as ancholic subject to the identity of the lyrical subject. Even within a trip that, so high, threatens to break the ties with the world of men. The opening of the passage - 駕八龍之婉婉兮 - where the conduct of eight dragons with elegant gesture is affirmed, should not only be read as a representation of the poet's physical or spiritual elevation, but rather as the inscription of the subject in a symbolic matrix that refers to shamanic practices of crossing between worlds of Chu and its archaic ritual practices, where the number eight, associated with the Cardeal Directions and Balance Cosmic, and the figure of the dragon, an injunction par excellence, project the poetic self to one other dimension, beyond the empirical reality and subjected to distinct rules and forms of perception of ordinary logic.
By connecting this trip with the next verse-載雲旗之委蛇-where the “cloud flags” move in a serpenty ripple, the text accentuates the ceremonial and almost processional character of crossing, adding a nonlinear movement element, where the fluidity and the absence of directional rigidity suggest that the poet's path is not governed by a closed teleology, but rather by a form of a form of Intuitive displacement, analogous to ritual dance or the internal unfolding of an consciousness in a state of revelation, in which the material elements - the carriage, the dragons, the flags - cease to function as mere instruments and become full symbols, with poetic agency and metaphorical density.
It is precisely within this cosmic choreography, where the movement seems absolute and the detachment of almost consummated matter, which occurs the rupture described by the third verse - 忽臨睨夫舊鄉兮 - in which the verb “look” (睨), modified by the adverb “suddenly” (忽), returns to the poem a dimension of interiority that until then was dissolved in the grandiose environment of crossing. In turning his eyes on the “homeland” (舊鄉), the lyrical subject interrupts, even momentarily, his ascending progression, reintegrating into the visionary space the memory of an origin that is, at the same time, geographical, affective and political. This gesture of return of look should not be interpreted as sentimental nostalgia, but as a statement of the impossibility of a total separation between the poet's spiritual trajectory and the concrete world where his moral integrity has been wounded, being the same world - degraded, corrupt but unreenivial - that structures the central tension of Li.
The fourth and last verse - 僕夫悲余馬懷 - which describes the stall's commotion and the longing of the horse, completes the picture by subscribing to the poet's accompaniment an emotional echo dimension, in which auxiliary figures, traditionally devoid of interior agency, are affected by the melancholy inflection of the main subject, as if their emotion overflowed to the world around the world. This projection of interiority over the elements of the surroundings is not a mere poetic resource of dramatization, but rather a deeply rooted strategy in the cosmological conception underlying Chuci, according to which the individual's emotional microcosm is in permanent correspondence with the order of the universe, and where there is no true separation between subject and environment, between intention and manifestation.
The work li sao is considered so central that, to this day, it is recited at the Dragon Boat Festival (端午節, Duanwu Jie), in memory of the tragic outcome of Qui Yuan's life, whose legendary death is at the origin of the dragon boat festival. The gesture of launching rice balls into the river, according to tradition, will have emerged as a way to feed the poet's spirit - or distract fish so that they would not devour his body.
粽子 (Zòngzi) is a traditional glutinous rice cake, usually wrapped in bamboo leaves, typical of the dragon boat festival (Duanwu Jie 端午节).
Two thousand years later, the tone of Chinese poetry undergoes a deep transformation, although the memory of Quean continues to echo in the subtext of each verse. The crossing of the centuries leads us to the age of Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911), a time when poetry abandons the cosmic and visionary lament of Chu to become increasingly a territory of aesthetic debates and exerts of literary affiliation.
Ming and Qing: poetry as a reflection
If in Que Yuan poetry is a visionary escape before political corruption, in the poets of the Ming era the creative gesture turns in: the crisis is no longer just moral but literary. The challenge now is another - reinventing language without betraying the inheritance.
In li sao, the poet summoned dragons and fenixes to narrate the impossibility of living among corrupt men. However, late China poets were facing another dilemma: how to support a tradition of over a thousand years without sliding for repetition, how to reinvent the poetic voice in a universe already saturated with symbols, shapes and canons? The creative gesture, then, turns inward and poetry becomes aware of itself, crossed by a constant dialogue with the past, as if every new verse was born in the shadow of all who preceded it.
In this scenario emerges the figure of Li Panlong (李攀龙, 1514–1570), whose writing is built between the weight of inheritance and the need for renewal. Known by the name of courtesy (zi) Yulin (于鱗) and the literary name (hào) Cāngming (滄溟), was born in Lìchéng (歷城), in the province of Shandong, and belonged to a group of intellectuals who sought to restore the lost greatness of the Tang.
In the center of Ming Poetry, one of the most intense debates in Chinese literary history gains shape: on the one hand, the “previous seven masters” (Qiney 前七子), a group of poets led by Li Mengyang and He Jingming, who defended a deliberate return to the models of the Tang dynasty; On the other, the “seven later masters” (Hòu qīzi 後七子), represented by Li Panlong and Wang Shizhen, who, although equally devoted to tradition, sought a freer and more creative approach, where imitation was not simple copy but transformation. This confrontation is not limited to rival schools; In it is drawn a larger dilemma, shared by all the poets of the last China: how to write under the shadow of a monumental canon without getting lost in it, how to make a true voice be reborn in a saturated territory of voices.
The previous seven masters saw in Tang poetry, especially in Du Fu's work, the supreme model of formal and moral perfection. They believed that the revitalization of culture went through the return to the “ancient spirit” (Fugu 复古), an attempt to regain the ethical and aesthetic strength that the Tang had crystallized. The word was conceived as inheritance, and the poet, as guardian of this temple. In Li Mengyang's verses, for example, Du Fu's epic ambition reappears, but in a tone already crossed by a loss of loss, as if the evoked greatness was always a little out of reach, dipped in the bruma of collective memory.
The seven later masters, among whom I read Panlong distinguished, did not reject this dialogue with the past, but sought in repetition a creative gesture, such as an old paint layer to discover the hidden shine of the original trait. In his reading, imitating the classics did not mean repeating their form, but prolonging their vital energy. This tension between reverence and invention produces a poetry of great historical consciousness, in which each word seems to weigh with the memory of centuries and, at the same time, to open itself to the possibility of another future.
This aesthetic turn also translates a deeper transformation in the relationship of poetry with the world. If in Que Yuan the poetic gesture coincided with existential gesture-wearing orchids, setting up dragons, facing gods and monsters, until the last response is found in Rio-in poets poetry becomes, for the first time, a self-reflexive act. It is no longer only the mirror of landscape or politics, but a meditation on itself: the poem writes as it thinks the very act of writing, but, when looking back, each poet discovered not only the greatness of the ancients, but also the awareness that language can never return unscathed to the point of origin.
With the dynastic collapse and foreign invasion, the melancholy of Qing poetry is not just aesthetic nostalgia, but a response to historical displacement. Poetic tradition becomes an enneved mirror where one seeks, once again, sense in the midst of the loss.
It is in this space of travel that the Qing poets, heirs and, in a way, critics of the entire Ming project are also inscribed. Under the weight of the dynastic collapse and the Manchu invasion, Qing poetry carries a tone of even more pronounced melancholy, as if the past were an alive landscape seen from afar, untouchable and at the same time essential. The title-enhanced pavilions become a symbol of an aesthetic of the interval: what one sees is always filtered by the distance, the loss and awareness of historical fragility.
黃河水繞漢邊牆 ，
河上秋風雁幾行。
黃塵古渡迷飛輓 ，
白月橫空冷戰場。
“The yellow river serpes through the walls of the Han border,
On the river, fly autonal geese in vain rows.
In the old vau, the golden dust blurred the wagons in the escape / while the moon hangs pale in the cold sky like a battlefield. ”
(my translation)
Here there are no dragons or phoenixes, but dust and cold moon. The epic becomes a historical landscape, as if time had taught the poet to look at not to the heavens, but to the ruins in the ground.
Among his contemporaries was Li Mengyang (李夢陽), one of the famous “seven previous masters” (Qi firezi 前七子), who advocated a deliberate return to classic models, seeing in du Fu an inexhaustible source of inspiration. In his poem “The Look of the Autumn” (秋望), melancholy is projects in the signs of the passage of time and historical decay. They still feel the echoes of the epic grandeur that animated the ancients; However, this resonance is already filtered by a different sensitivity, more aware of the human fragility and the precariousness of the present. Unlike Que Yuan, whose rebellion culminated in absolute dive, Ming and Qing poets seem to write from a more subtle balance between reverence and disenchantment, a place where nostalgia becomes form and poetry itself becomes a dialogue with its own memory:
一瓶一笠一條蓑 ，
善操吳音與楚歌。
野鶴神清因骨老 ，
鴛鴦頭白為情多。
“A jug of wine, a bamboo hat, a straw cover,
I dominate the melodies of Wu and the songs of Chu.
The wild herons keep the spirit clear, for the bones have aged,
The Mandarins ducks clinked together with so much lived love. ”
(my translation)
Here poetry is no longer exile, but everyday pleasure. Que yuan left for the ends of the world in search of justice, Yuan Hongdao, in turn, finds the lightness of the instant and in the corner of the birds the poetic truth.
We must not forget Yuan Mei (袁枚) of the eighteenth century, which defended spontaneity and personal sensitivity against excessive formalism. For him, poetry should be born from genuine emotion and not blind obedience to tradition. There are those who see in him a modern, almost romantic spirit, Avant La Lettre.
The contrast of course: qui yuan is poetry as a visionary trip, while ming-qing poets are poetry as a stylistic reflection. One escapes because there is no place for him; The others find a place in their own tradition and play it, reinventing it. Both, deep down, deal with the same restlessness: what to do when the world is not enough?
For Que Yuan, the answer was the mythical flight. For Yuan Hongdao, it was the wine, the singing, the irony. For Li Mengyang, he went to look at the ruins of the war with autumn eyes. Poetry, in all cases, is the space where the human measures over time, whether rising to heaven, or drinking by the Qinhuai River.
Today, as we read these verses, we feel both the dizziness of the sky of Quean and the melancholy of the ming and Qing minged pavilions. As in a world that also feels in crisis - political, climate, existential - we need both answers: the visionary escape that reminds us that we can still dream dragons, and the daily lightness that reminds us that a jar of wine and a song to resist.

The Dragon Boat Festival (端午節, Duanwujie)
Celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, this festival resembles the death of Que Yuan. According to legend, the people of the region launched rice balls (粽子, zongzi) to the river to feed the spirit of the poet or distract the fish from his body. Today, besides the dumplings, the dragon-shaped boat race keeps alive the memory of the exiled poet who has become a cultural hero.
Shenyun (神韻) - the “spiritual resonance”
During the Ming and Qing, critics like Wang Shizhen argued that a good poem must have Shenyun, a difficult immaterial quality: something like the “spiritual breath” or the “atmosphere of the soul” that resonates beyond words. It was not just a technique or style, but a vibration that made the poem transcende. We could call him, in a free translation, the invisible music of poetry.
Gong'an's school (公安派)
Founded by brothers Yuan (Yuan Hongdao, Yuan Zongdao and Yuan Zhongdao), Gong'an's school reacted against classic formalism and defended individual expression, simple language and personal experience as a source of poetry. Yuan Hongdao, with his verses on wine, straw hats and wild birds, is perhaps the best example of this search for authenticity.
The fall moon and the heart of China
In numerous Chinese poems - such as Li Mengyang - The Moon of Autumn emerges as a symbol of melancholy, nostalgia and contemplation. It is not just light, but memory: the fall-filled moon coincides with the middle-oversight festival (中秋節), when separate families look at the same moonlight and feel gathered at a distance. To read these verses is to realize how poetry intertwines with rituals that still survive today.
The longevity of qui yuan
Curiosity: Although Qui Yan lived in the fourth century BC, his fame never diminished. In the twentieth century, the poet was recovered as a nationalist symbol in modern China, and is now celebrated as the first great Chinese poet "of individual consciousness." Your li is, in a sense, one of the oldest autobiographical poems in the world.
Between dragons and wine jars, qui yuan and Ming and Qing poets offer them two faces of the same truth: poetry is refuge and resistance, exile and reunion, visionary escape and serene melancholy. Read today, its strength is not exhausted in historical curiosity: it continues to challenge us, remembering that writing poetry is always to try to transform the world's insufficiency into lasting beauty.

The place was recently the scene of an experimental film festival, demonstrating potentialities to add a new cultural space to the city. However, the owner complains of high costs and financial difficulties
 
Speaking of the half -abandoned and empty walls of the Green Island Convent, located in the small hill in the northern zone of the peninsula, implies retreating to the early days of Portuguese presence in Macao and the Jesuits, namely the mid -17th century. By this time, Macau was already a territory of trade between Portuguese, foreigners and Chinese, entering the Asian Route of the Specialty Trade and other raw materials.
Only then can it be understood the importance of this classified building that is on land with private property. The Cultural Institute (IC) wants to see the building renewed in partnership with the owner, after years and years of a lawsuit dragged in the courts between two companies to prove the true property of the land.
Despite the almost abandonment, the Green Island Convent hosted this summer an outdoor movie festival, showing the potential of the place as a new cultural space. The event in question was the Macau Experimental Film Festival, organized by the CUT Audiovisual Association.
At HM, festival curator Keng U Lao explained that “space is currently being the target of renewal works”, and that for the festival the garden zone was used and “some rooms of the building”.
For the official, the Green Island Convent "is a fantastic place for cultural events, and both owners and the team were incredibly welcoming and helpful."  Photo: CUT Association
The curator of the Film Festival understands that the convent is "a jewel that few places have visited", having been "closed for over a decade." "Perhaps this is the reason our audience was so enthusiastic to watch the closing event and explore the space, because we had exhausted capacity," he said.
According to Keng U Lao, and taking into account the experimental nature of the festival, it was sought to “use the spaces available for projections, performances and audiovisual facilities, allowing the intersection with the unique architecture of the site”.
For the curator, the Green Island Convent could be “an excellent place for cultural events, including visual arts exhibitions, shows, musical events and film sessions”.
Conflict with mandarins
In 1618 a conflict began between the Company of Jesus, which was already headquartered on Verde Island in this convent, and the local Chinese authorities, due to the use of space by the Portuguese Jesuits. It is a conflict that, according to the work “Macao: Power and Knowledge-16th and 17th centuries”, only ends on February 3, 1621 when the Senate intervenes, completely remedy on August 14 of the same year, continuing the Jesuits to live on Verde Island without, however, affirming themselves as owners of something.
The historian describes that the Jesuits were able to remain "with authorization from the mandarins and without complaining the possession", and before July 1621 occurred "the demolition of buildings by order of the Chinese district authorities."
More than a handful of old walls, in the Convent of Green Island is part of the activity and presence of the Jesuits in Macao, as well as political issues that always marked the territory, namely those who exerted sovereignty about Macao.
“The episode of Green Island is exemplary to several titles, but above all it serves to show to what extent is the Macao oligarchy and to what extent the Senate can intermediate conflicts between district and regional Chinese powers (…)”, reads in Luís Filipe Barreto's book.
Over the years, the convent and adjacent terrain have been running from hand to hand until they stopped those of Jack Fu, who managed to see in court in 2022, the property of the convent by his development company Wui San.
At the time of the judicial victory, Jack Fu regretted that "the process has elapsed so slowly," it is a "dispute that took place for more than ten years." Faced with journalists, Jack Fu promised to find “balance between development and space preservation”.
Financial difficulties
HM sought to know what has been done since then. It is clear that they remain uncertainties about the future of space, with many budgetary issues to the mixture. Some works have already been done entirely supported by the Wui San Development Company, but a long -term strategy is missing.
"The IC requires the restoration of the convent in its original state," said Jack Fu. "We have done our best and in these years [since 2022] the company has done many things. If the convent has to be all restored in its original state I can not evaluate how much money will cost because our company's [financial] capacity is limited. I think it can cost between dozens and up to 100 million [of Patacas]," he said.
Thus, the tasks that the Wui San Development Company has been doing since 2022 have the removal of waste, recovery from some infrastructure and destruction of illegal constructions or that were at risk of falling. It should be noted that the old convent, at a time when his property was defined, came to house construction workers who rented rooms, living in precarious conditions.
"We were maintaining various spaces according to our ability, but we could not restore the convent completely to its original state," he said.
Jack Fu says he spent to date “between 10 and 20 million [Patacas]” in the recovery of some convent zones, unable to advance with a date for the complete restoration. "It all depends on the financial situation and if there is enough capital. It may be within two or three years, but if the government is dependent on the repair only by the private to take this great value is impossible," he warned.
The landowner said that the IC suggested to the company to run for the financial support plan for the benefit of historical buildings to obtain "a two million patacas allowance in a maximum of two years."
"But this value won't relieve the problem," said Jack Fu, who fears that the renewal process has dragged on for years.
"That's why we proposed an exchange for a specific plan or resolution," noting that "the progress of restoration is slow and the authorities just ask for recovery, not concerning the costs we will have," he adds.
Jack Fu also warns that the legislation and the Macao Director Plan contribute to further delay the renewal. “The government is working at the North Planning and Management Operative Unit - 1 and we don't know more information. As everything has to be according to this plan we can only present opinions. We have proposed several opinions to the authorities who can accept them or take into account in the future.”
Works ending in 2024
On the part of the IC, it was mentioned, in a response sent to HM, that the Green Island Hill where the convent is "is a classified place, being the land of private property." “Over the years, and under the terms of the cultural heritage safeguard law, IC has diligently supervised, coordinated and promoted compliance with the responsibilities inherent to the owners regarding preservation and management, as well as the execution of necessary repairs and maintenance”, is referred to.
Remembering the “illegal occupations that the hill suffered for several, which made it difficult to develop the planned protection actions”, the IC asked “the owners to carry out urgent repair and reordering works”, and they were “completed in early 2024”.
The works of Jack Fu were made “according to the requirements of the IC” and go through the “restoration and renewal of walls, windows, roof and columns of the retreat house”.
As for the future use of space, as it is in the private forum, it will be up to IC to request opinions, and "the body will pronounce within the protection of cultural heritage."
For Jack Fu, the Green Island Convent could be “a basis of sino-widening cultural exchange, according to the country's requirements to Macau and the current situation” of the territory. "What we said to the government is that Macau is a world center of tourism and leisure, but here is a cultural tourism complex where tourists can walk and stay a day or two, so this space can play this role, as it has the advantage of being close to three border posts," he said.
For now, and separate the high costs to rebuild all this, Jack Fu is confident. “The development of the [Green Island] Zone has not started and only now the provisional fuel deposit will change its location. If it is including our land, there are conditions for a large complex of cultural tourism.”</description><pubDate>2025-09-02 00:59:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Portuguese knight bets on the formation of competition horses in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/cavaleiro-portugues-aposta-na-formacao-de-cavalos-de-competicao-na-china/</link><description>Report by João Pimenta, Agência Lusa
Step, trot and gallop: On a farm outside Beijing, Portuguese João Ruas training six horses daily to the practice of Dressage, an equestrian Olympic discipline that seeks to expose the maximum of the animal's athletic capabilities.
“It's a very very relationship,” he described to Lusa the Knight, a native of Lisbon. "There are days when we are almost like a father to teach the son, others where it is the horse that teaches us to us. But there must always be mutual respect," he said.
Streets, 28, arrived in China a year ago to raise six horses and form Dressage on a farm in Shunyi, the district in northeastern Beijing where the villages and agricultural fields resemble the interior of China than the capital of 22 million.
Ten kilometers from the Huairou reservoir, a 12 -kilometer artificial lake that supplies Beijing and regulates the flow of local rivers, the fifth is surrounded by watercourses, tree -lined slopes, corn fields and natural reserves.
On the horizon, the mountainous chains that rise to the north of the Changing and Huairou districts complete a landscape that contrasts with the tangle of glazed torres and apartments blocks of Beijing's urban network. “When I'm here I don't remember if I'm in China, Portugal or Germany,” explained João Ruas. "I'm in a bubble, let's say, and it's a good bubble."
Without previous experience in the country, the Portuguese was surprised by the sympathy of the Chinese and the reception of the local community. On the day he was interviewed by the Lusa agency, his cargo tricycle advocated on his way to the supermarket. Depressing the neighbors quickly sent to try to fix the vehicle.
“I am the only foreigner here. I communicate for gestures, I am still learning Chinese, but I have always been very well treated. The neighbors help in everything,” he said.
Despite the enthusiasm with life in the countryside, the coach admits difficulties in the exercise of the sport he has been practicing since he was nine years old. "There is a lot of amateurism, little technique, expensive and poorly frequency evidence. And everything that involves horses here is frankly more expensive than in Europe."
The horse “is not dominated by force: it requires patience, knowledge and sensitivity,” he said. "It's like an athlete. There are good days and bad days. And don't speak. We have to know how to read the signs. A small reaction may indicate a serious problem," he noted.
In Portugal, João Ruas studied at the D. Dinis Agricultural Professional School, where he reconciled classes for last weekends with the coach. Since then, it never left the horses. "I started with once a week, then two, then three, until I got to five. I had to insist a lot with my parents to start," he said.
In China, he works with European horses, brought on purpose to compete in Dressage evidence. The goal is to prepare animals since the age of three for competitions that normally start at four. "There is still a tradition of creation with sports focus. Horses have been raised for many years, but not with selective criterion for sport," he said.
Shanghai, the country's economic “capital”, leads the practice of drassage in the country, with more proof and better infrastructure. In Beijing, there is a growing interest, but there is still a long way to go. “It can be good to start like this, almost from scratch. It allows you to do things well. Without addictions,” reflected streets.
With the arrival of another horse soon and the prospect of continuing work in China, João Ruas is said. "I see myself here for many more years. It only costs the distance. But with today's technology, we managed to shorten it," he said. "There are sacrifices that are good for the soul."</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:54:44</pubDate></item><item><title>USJ | Researchers discover a new species of bacteria in Portugal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/08/usj-investigadores-descobrem-nova-especie-de-bacteria-em-portugal/</link><description>A team of local university researchers identified a new species of bacteria in the Salinas of Rio Maior, Portugal. The type of discovered organism, which lives in extreme environments, widens the limits of biological knowledge and may have implications in areas such as biomedicine, pharmacy or even spatial exploration
 
There is news in the field of microbiology thanks to the latest discovery of a team of researchers linked to the University of São José (USJ), led by André Antunes, interim director of the Institute of Sciences and Environment of the same educational institution.
It is the discovery of a new species of bacteria from 12 samples collected in the Salinas of Rio Maior, in Portugal, which led to the establishment of the new species “Fodinibius alkaliphilus”. The species of bacteria previously known as “Alifodinibius salipaludis” for “Fodinibius salipaludis” was also reclassified.
The conclusions appear in the article “Fodinibius alkaliphilus sp. Nov., Moderately halophilic and alkaliphilic bacterium isolated from an Inland Saltern in central and reclassification of aliifodinibius salipaludi as fodinibius salipalis sp. SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY. The scientific journal is a publication “reference for new macrobial data”, being the official publication of the International Procaryotes Systematic Committee and the Applied Bacteriology and Microbiology Division of the International Union of Microbiological Societies, describes a USJ note.
In addition to André Antunes, the authors team includes researchers from the University of Science and Technology of Macau, coordinated by Marta Filipa Simões; Researchers at the University of Minho and Seville University.
According to the same USJ note, "the new [bacteria] species grows better in salinities about four times higher than those of seawater and also prefers alkaline conditions, combining the ability to grow in different extreme environmental conditions."
The importance of this type of studies, including analyzes to “such extreme environments”, is “future applications in a wide range of fields, including biomedical and pharmaceutical, but also extends to the discovery of new useful materials and the provision of useful information for future space exploration”.
The same team of investigators is not stopped, as "other samples of these places are currently being investigated and new publications describing other new species are expected in the coming months."
“This publication highlights the strengths of Macao in articulation with partners from Portuguese and Spanish -speaking countries, as well as its growing importance in the fields of biodiversity and biotechnology,” is still described.
The Power of Salinas
The researchers explain that "the species Aliifodinibius Salipaludis has been described, but their name has not yet been validly published." In field work the team isolated these species from “hypersaline environments, including saline, salt mines and saline soils”.
Prior to the field work itself, the team conducted “an investigation to the microbial diversity of hypersaline environments in downtown Portugal”, with samples in the Rio Maior zone in July 2019, 12 genera bacteria were isolated from the Rio Maior salines.
Located in the central area of ​​Portugal, in these Salinas there is “brine, which is about seven times more salty than seawater”, being “pumping from a well and generated by the crossing of a local groundwater course with an extensive salt deposit”.
The article also gives a historical context of this location. "Although they were first referred to in twelfth-century documents, these places are believed to have been linked to salt extraction from prehistoric times. They offer a single scenario, as they are the only interior saline in Portugal and the only ones in full functioning throughout Europe."
Thus, the study in question "was part of a bioprospecting campaign centered on this place", resulting in "in the isolation of a bacterial strain (N2T) and the discovery of a new putative species within the genus Fodinibius."
In this work is determined “the taxonomic position of this new isolated based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonos and molecular properties”, is described.
Importance for Science
At HM, André Antunes explained that this discovery is, first of all, interesting to the scientific community, by bringing “additional information” and constituting a discovery “about the biodiversity that exists on our planet, more concretely at the macrobial level”.
"So far, we have been able [general scientific community] to study less than 1 percent of all microbes species on the planet. In over 99 percent we have no idea what they are, what they do and what their abilities, or what impact on the environment and our lives," he explained.
The researcher also said that "the microbes that come from extreme environments, and above all from environments with a lot of salt, which is the case of this species we now discover, are very interesting for a large range of biotechnology applications."
"We can include things like the medical area, biomedicine, the production of new pharmaceutical compounds or the production of new biomaterials, such as bioplastics," said André Antunes. The academic even talks about applications in “more exotic areas, which are now beginning to have a little more visibility, such as the potential application in construction, the production of more sustainable cements or concrete structures that have the self -repair capacity”.
This discovery also has some impact "for space exploration, more specifically to better understand what the limits of life are and where to seek life outside our planet." It is also included "very important implications for missions that are exploring Mars, namely as to the type of environments where it may be feasible to find past signs of life or present or other parts of the solar system."
A job that continues
The investigation is not for the Salinas of Rio Maior, and the team led by André Antunes last year, an expedition to Antarctica. “There are antarctic samples that we are currently studying and we have samples taken from the red sea bottom, where salt concentration is also quite high.” Therefore, the saga of discovering new bacteria and potential reclassifications in those that already exist.
André Antunes says that the discovery of a new species of microbes "is quite important to science, not only for the perspective of science at the basic level, but because we can have a better perspective of diversity we have on the planet."
“As we study extreme environments we can have additional information about what the limits of life are and how life adapts to extreme conditions.” Thus, André Antunes advocates investment in science so that there is later “an associated practical component, so it is not always easy to convince the financing entities”, as to this point.
The researcher also points out that the article and the investigation fits “very well in the priorities of Macau and the USJ itself, with regard to the focus in the area of ​​environment, biodiversity and biotechnology, anchored in connection with Lusophony”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-08 00:04:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Finance | Portugal withdraws Hong Kong from the list of tax havens</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/financas-portugal-retira-hong-kong-da-lista-de-paraisos-fiscais/</link><description>From January 1, 2026, Hong Kong will no longer be part of the Portuguese tax paradise list, such as Liechtenstein and Uruguay. The authorities in the neighboring region have long called for the withdrawal, including official visits to Portugal. The Portugal-Hong Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kong emphasizes the decision consistent with the position of the European Union
 
The Hong Kong government has finally seen the desire, expressed several times, to leave the list of tax havens in Portugal. The change will be a reality from January 1, 2026, taking into account the ordinance published on Friday by the Ministry of Finance in the Diário da República.
According to this document, Hong Kong is no longer included in the list of “clearly more favorable tax regimes”, the official name of the list commonly known as the “Fiscal Paradise List”.
It reads at the Ordinance, signed by the Secretary of State for Tax Affairs, Claudia Reis Duarte, that “the governments of the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the East Republic of Uruguay drove formal requests” to the “revision of their framing in the list, which were the subject of positive opinions elaborated by the Tax and Customs Authority”. The withdrawal of these three countries and territories is officially on January 1 of next year.
Thus, the Portuguese Government considers that the conditions are verified to, in the legally established terms, exclude those jurisdictions from the list of countries, territories or regions with clearly more favorable tax regimes ”.
It is also noteworthy that “the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay are not on the European Union of Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction List, adopted by the European Union Council, which took place on February 18, 2025”.
It is recalled that one of the last times that Hong Kong made a formal request to leave the list of tax havens was during the visit to Lisbon of the Secretary for Financial and Treasury Services, Christopher Hui Ching-Yu, last year, as a meeting with Secretary of State Claudia Reis Durte.
There, and according to Lusa, the ruler of the neighboring region "expressed concern" for Hong Kong being considered a fiscal paradise since the list was created by the Portuguese authorities in 2004.
The inclusion in the list “would subject Hong Kong companies to a tax increase and special measures” in Portugal, described the ruler, who recalled that the two parties signed an agreement to prevent double taxation, which came into force in 2012.
In the same meeting, Christopher Hui reminded the Portuguese Secretary of State that the European Union (EU) removed, in February 2024, Raehk from the non -cooperative jurisdictions list for tax purposes, a decision that, in the secretary's understanding, “demonstrated the EU recognition of Hong Kong's efforts” to introduce measures that combat “the [fiscal] fiscal] resulting from the non -non -pair evasion taxation ”. Christopher Hui added that Hong Kong already fulfilled all European standards in this matter.
It should be noted that, at the time, the Portuguese Minister of the Economy was Pedro Reis, who at an event about Christopher Hui's visit to Lisbon, said it was important to “maintain sustainable economic growth and take advantage of the opportunities for mutual investment” between Portugal and Hong Kong.
Chamber of Commerce Rejubila
However, the Portugal-Hong Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kong (PHKCCI, in the English acronym) issued a note in LinkedIn to highlight Hong Kong's exit from this list. "This milestone represents the culmination of a long-term and transverse process in Portugal, which involved continuous dialogue and coordination between successive governments, parliamentary parties and international partners. Although the consensus on the objective was solid, the process has gradually unfolded over more than a decade," he reads.
For PHKCCI, the Portuguese State decision “restores coherence with the European Union's rules and reflects Portugal's commitment to a fair and current approach to its tax governance”, also stressing the “importance of respecting objective criteria, maintaining a permanent dialogue and ensuring legal and diplomatic rigor in the management of fiscal policy”.
“As a chamber of commerce and industry Portugal-Hong Kong, we greeted this outcome as a step forward in the alignment of our bilateral environment of commerce and investment with predictability, transparency and good governance. We maintain a committed to facilitating constructive involvement between our markets, supporting the clarity in tax staff and fostering mutual confidence”, is referred to in the same note.
According to the online newspaper Eco, the inclusion of a country or territory on the list of tax havens happens if there is no tax similar to IRC [tax on the income of legal persons], charged in Portugal, or the existence of tax benefits that are more favorable than in the European country.
It also serves as a criterion for inclusion in the list administrative practices of countries or regions do not allow the effective exchange of tax information. All issues that Hong Kong considers to have exceeded and ensure that there is full respect for the fight against fiscal dropout.
More concretely, and when his visit to Portugal last year, Secretary Christopher Hui spoke of the “Hong Kong efforts in the introduction of a foreign source performance regime (FSIE) for certain passive income to better combat transionic dropout resulting from the non -taxation”. In his view, "such efforts fully aligned the Hong Kong FSIE regime with FSIE regimes updated by the EU regimes in December 2022".
MEXIDES IN FSIE
According to an explanatory note from consultant PriceWaterhousecoopers (PWC), Hong Kong was added to the EU Observation list in October 2021. On that date, the EU was concerned that, under the then Foreign Source Exemption Scheme (FSIE), there could be situations in which companies without substantial economic activity in Hong Kong would not be subject to Tax regarding certain passive income from a foreign source (such as interest and royalties), thus resulting in situations of 'double non-tax', ”can be read.
The following year, Raehk "promulgated legislative changes", namely in December 2022, to "improve and reinforce the FSIE regime against transfronical fiscal evasion."
With the changes in force since 1 January 2023, “the four types of foreign source income”, such as dividends, interest, intellectual property income and alienation gains from the sale of corporate interests, are “being considered origin in Hong Kong and subject to profit tax if received in Hong Kong by an entity of a multinational group that exercises trade, profession or business in the business Territory, ”explains PWC,“ except if this entity meets the requirements of the applicable exception ”.
After the EU's suggestion, "the Raehk government further perfected the FSIE regime to widen the scope of the covered incomes, including alienation gains from other types of assets (beyond corporate appearances) in order to align with the latest EU orientation, with effect from 1 January 2024".
It was then that on February 20 last year the EU council published the conclusions of the semiannual EU review regarding the “non -cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes”, the so -called “black list” of tax havens, as well as the “observation list” regarding the “state of cooperation with the EU in relation to the commitments made by cooperative jurisdictions to implement principles of good tax governance”.
At that time Hong Kong was taken from the list, considering the EU that the territory had "fulfilled the commitment by changing the FSIE regime", highlighting PWC, in the same note, that Raehk is now "among the jurisdictions that cooperate with the EU and do not have pending commitments."
According to PWC, "the Raehk government greeted the recognition of the EU of efforts to align its FSIE regime with the relevant requirements, as reflected in its removal from the EU observation list", and will also have "will continue to comply with international tax standards, while maintaining Hong Kong fiscal competitiveness."</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 02:09:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Political programs focused on the economy and social support</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/05/eleicoes-programas-politicos-com-foco-na-economia-e-apoios-sociais/</link><description>There are six lists of candidates for deputies by Via Direct, and another six by the way indirect. There are new guys, many out of departure and even deputies who decided to wander among suffrage. The main focuses of political programs continue to be employment, the promotion of the economy and the increase in social support
 
On September 14 will be chosen the deputies of the Legislative Assembly (AL), either by the vote of the people, in the direct via or by indirect way through the associations that represent the various professional sectors. The campaign is on the streets and the 12 lists have made available electoral programs whose content does not differ much from the interpeairs presented to the government in recent years, given that most of the list heads have been in AL for some time.
Thus, issues such as the crisis in youth employment, the incentive for local consumption, the need for more social support and the regional integration of Macao in Hengqin and the Great Bay dominate the measures presented.
In the case of list 1, the “Association of United Citizens of Macao” has roots in Fujian and is led by Mrs Song Pek Kei, who started very young to accompany businessman Chan Meng Kam in parliamentary Lides. Now he is accompanied by the young deputy Nick Lei, followed in third place, and on a list of ten people, Chan Lai Kei.
In the work area, the list defends the creation of a share for residents in all professional areas, “support for employment and local companies”, and the guarantee that “85 percent, or more, of employees are local residents”.
It is also advocated the release of “vacancies in the financial and management areas for qualified residents”, as well as the granting of a subsidy of five thousand patacas for “each resident eligible in employment support, unemployed or temporary workers”.
The Nova Esperança list, led by José Pereira Coutinho, wants “employment for all” and promises to fight for “Macao's permanent residents priority at game dealers” and the establishment of a “compulsory system (pension fund), which protects 100 percent to the population”.
The electoral program also emphasizes the area of ​​game promoters, whose number of licenses has fallen by the last years. The list calls for “reinforcement of its viability by increasing the legal commission from 1.25 to 1.30 percent” and “facilitating the opening of bank accounts for licenses” junket attributed by the executive.
In the case of list 3, the Promoting Union for Progress, which represents the General Union of Macao residents' associations, led by Deputy Leong Hong Sai, asks for “improving the use of residents”, tourism revitalization or support for “small and medium enterprises”.
List 5, the union for development, is led by a well -known al face. Ella Lei and the workers' bench partner Leong Sun Iok again put their jobs as a political priority.
The “guarantee of employment opportunities to local” is asked, as well as the “improvement of the entry and exits system of foreign workers”.
The list of workers promises to fight for the development of “paid training to increase the qualifications of local workers”, as well as “improvement of the employment support system, properly increasing the allocation of services”.
Also in the work area, this group of candidates asks to be “improved the workers protection system to increase their living”, suggesting the “strengthening of the salary structure” and the “social security system to increase workers' protection level”.
Consuming it is necessary
Since Macao has recovered from the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the closing of business, which another problem has placed: the fact that it is easier to travel to China has made residents consume less in the territory, affecting the trade in less tourist areas.
This has been a recurring theme in the interventions of deputies in AL and is also in the electoral programs. Returning to the list linked to the Fujian community, “incentives for domestic consumption” are asked to “reduce pressure on residents' lives” and “revitalize the local economy”. For this should be followed "the experiences of consumption support programs between 2020 and 2022, creating new consumer cards to stimulate trade."
In the case of Pereira Coutinho's list, the institution is defended “an electronic annual support card for the consumption of 10,000 patacas”, and the candidate even calls for the creation of a permanent cash planning plan with the value from 15,000.
The workers also ask "the stimulus to consumption in order to help residents spend and boost the economy."
In the case of Macao-Guangdong Union 4, representing the Jiangmen Naturals, and led by the academic Joey Lao Chi Ngai, it is asked to “promote the operation of a 'coordination working group for employment promotion, in order to boost the social mobility of residents.” It is also suggested to review “several social security regimes, and investment in resources to support the elderly, children, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups”.

Consumption is not forgotten
With regard to the executive's subsidies to the so -called most vulnerable layers of the population, children, young people, the elderly, chronic patients or disabled people, all lists ask for more.
In the case of the group led by Song Pek Kei it is suggested to conduct a study “on the creation of a universal health insurance system to ensure free basic medical services for all residents”. It is also asked for a “better use of resources to expand coverage of medical services and reduce families' burden” in this area. It should be noted that the Executive, in addition to complying with moderating rates for residents, also assigns health valleys worth six thousand patacas for residents.
Song Pek Kei's list takes one of Sam Hou Fai's latest measures, the creation of a childhood allowance to ask for its extension from three to six years of the beneficiary. The creation of “differentiated subsidies for the second and third children” is also advocated, as well as a 90-day maternity leave to increase the birth rate.
Looking at the New Hope list, the news is the request for conversion “of the current [health] benefits to multifunctional consumption valleys with the value of 10,000 patacas”, as well as the expansion of the maternity leave to 90 days. In the case of childhood subsidy, the New Hope defends its extension up to the child's 12 years and a monthly payment of 2,000 patacas.
Also noteworthy is to defend the increase in the allowance to informal caregivers and monoparent families from 5,000 to 8,000 monthly patacas. Given that Coutinho is linked to the Association of Macao Public Function Workers, this is an area that is paid attention to this political program: increase, between 30 and 50 percent, “from the base remuneration, replacing the 100 points of the Indicion Table, to the agents of the security forces”, also defending the “voluntary retirement after 20 years of service”.
In the case of list 6, a good home alliance, led by Wong Kit Cheng, the most and better measures are made for parents: “increase the number of parental licenses and monitoring to prenatal exams”, it reads, also the defense of “more flexible working hours and tax deductions by the number of children in charge”.
In an overview of the programs, it should be noted that in six lists of direct suffrage, only the new hope list uses the two official, Portuguese and Chinese languages. In the indirect suffrage there are more groups to make this bet, such as the union of the business interests of Macau and the union of the interests of Macao professionals. There are no English programs. These elections are based on the departure of deputies such as Ron Lam U Tou, Chak Mo, Chan Hong and Lei Chan U.
What indirects want
In the indirect suffrage there is a novelty: the entry of businessman Kevin Ho, nephew of Edmund Ho, to the list led by José Chui Sa Peng, the “Union of Macau Business Interests”, which represents the industrial, commercial and financial sectors. Highlight, in this group, for the entry of Si Ka Lon, which always competed by the way. This group advocates “support for digital and high -tech transformation to modernize traditional industries and develop emerging sectors”, also promising to “listen carefully to the difficulties and claims of commercial and financial industries, especially small and medium -sized companies”.
Kevin Ho
The union of the interests of Macao professionals, led by Iau Teng Pio, a subdirector of the Faculty of Law of the University of Macao, defends the struggle for the “training of the diversification of the economy in accordance with professional strength” and “the articulation of the rules of Macau and Hengqin”. To this end, it suggests the creation of an “experimental zone of application” of these same norms, exploring “a direct and transfronical execution mechanism of arbitration”. Following is the desire to “strengthen international competitiveness of law”, encouraging “exceptional talents to study in the interior of China”.
A face for education
Ho Ion Sang, a face that we got used to in direct suffrage, competes again for the indirect suffrage alone, representing the education sector, with the Association of Promotion of Social Service and Education.
The candidate calls for the “implementation of mental health support measures” as well as “improving the overall quality of Macao medical services and effectiveness in care”. Ho Ion Sang promises to fight for measures that look “the impact of low birth in the education system” and more “support for inclusive education and special education schools”.
The businesswoman Angela Leong joins the first time to MA Chi Seng to compete for the Cultural and Sports Union of Sol Nascente, in defense of culture and sport. One of the ideas is “asking the government to guide the use of the free -related elements [of the concessionaires] to support local cultural and sports activities”.
In the “Joint Commission of the Associations of Employees”, led by Deputy Lam Lon Wai, it is defended the improvement of infrastructure, the “reduction of business costs and the facilitation of trade and investment”. The promotion of the “sharing the benefits of economic development with employees” is asked, stabilizing a “salary growth mechanism”.
In the union of workers' associations, led by Leong Pou U and Choi Kam Fu, it is suggested “improving the protection of work and workers”, as well as “the protection of the basic rights of workers, improving infrastructure of child support”. The “dynamic adjustment of the minimum wage to ensure basic life needs” is also advocated.</description><pubDate>2025-09-05 00:01:01</pubDate></item><item><title>SCO | China reveals ten -year plan for multipolar world</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/02/sco-china-revela-plano-de-dez-anos-para-mundo-multipolar/</link><description>In Tianjin was presented the initiative of global governance, a Beijing plan that defends multilateralism in the world geopolitical order. From the Shanghai Cooperation Organization came a new Defense Defense of the Multipolar World, as well as new “100 Small and Exemplary Projects” of financial support to the body's member countries
 
The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) approved a development strategy for the next decade, with the aim of promoting a multipolar world, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced yesterday. The global governance initiative (GGI, on the English acronym) comes at a time when the regional bloc recognized, in a joint statement, that the worsening of geopolitical tensions represents a growing threat to the safety of its members.
Speaking after the 25th SCO summit, which took place in Tianjin, in northeastern China, Wang said the development strategy until 2035 “defines the tone and a clear direction for the next decade”, considering it one of the main results of the meeting.
The summit had as its backdrop the increase in friction between some of the main members of SCO and the United States of America (USA), namely due to sanctions and commercial fares applied by Donald Trump administration.
Wang classified the meeting as the “most fruitful” to date, stressing that participants have issued a unified message against unilateral actions, in an implicit reference to Washington. "The summit firmly defended a multilateral trade mechanism centered on the World Trade Organization, rejected unilateral measures that violate the organization's rules and sent a clear message in support of equity against intimidation," said Chinese diplomacy chief.
Wang also announced the creation of four new SCO security centers, focusing on combating regional security, transnational organized crime, drug trafficking and information security.
According to Xinhua agency, Wang Yi also said that GGI has arrived "at the right time," given that "the world faces numerous challenges, including frequent regional turbulences, a slow economic growth and the increase in anti-globalization [ideas and movements."
The GGI has as its principles “respect for sovereign equality, the observation of international law, the practice of multilateralism, the defense of a people centered on concrete actions”, concepts that are “in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Letter,” noted Wang Yi.
The Chinese Foreign Minister also recalled that GGI is the “fourth global initiative proposed by President XI Jinping in recent years” after the launch of the global development initiative, the global security initiative and the global civilization initiative.
According to the minister, "these four initiatives bring stability and predictability to a turbulent world, reflecting the active role and sense of responsibility of China in international affairs."
A new statement
From the summit also came the statement of Tianjin of the Council of Heads of State of SCO, where multilateralism is a watchword. “World politics and economics, as well as other areas of international relations, have undergone profound historical transformations. The international system is heading for a fairer, more egalitarian and representative multipolarity, opening new perspectives for national development and cooperation with mutual benefits,” he can read.
In the same document, SCO Member States commit to “deepening long-term partnerships and further strengthening Shanghai's cooperation organization, in order to jointly preserve regional peace, safety and stability, promoting sustainable development” countries.
In the statement, it is also established that SCO member countries "consider interference in internal affairs in other states under any pretexts, as well as the use of unilateral coercion measures that are not based on international law and harm the interests of other states."
"Member States reaffirm their position of principle against the imposition of extraterritorial unilateral sanctions," was still declared in the document.
Support to countries
President Xi Jinping reaffirmed the view of a new world order that challenges Western rule, appealing to the construction of a fairer and more multipolar international system. "The SCO must oppose the Cold War mindset, the confrontation between blocks and the behaviors of intimidation," Xi said in the main speech of the summit, in an indirect reference to the United States.
The Chinese leader defended a reform in global governance with greater representation to the global south and called for the “equal and uniform” application of international law, without double standards or the hegemony of the few.
Xi also announced a set of concrete measures to face the challenges to development, at a time when the US trade war raises fears of global economic stagnation.
Among the initiatives are 100 “small and exemplary projects” of well-being support in SCO countries, more than two billion Yuan in non-reimburseable aid and ten billion yuan in loans to the SCO Interbank Consortium in the next three years.
XI also revealed plans to accelerate the creation of a SCO development bank to reinforce security and economy cooperation between member states. "We must expand the basis of cooperation and fully use the resources of each country, assuming the responsibility for peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region," he said.
Regarding China's role in the world geopolitical system, Xi Jinping highlighted a series of measures and initiatives in which he considers that the country was a pioneer. In Monday's speech at SCO, he stressed that “we were the first to launch the cooperation of the track and route initiative”, and a large number of signature projects were developed ”. In addition, “cooperation at the level of industrial investment has significantly advanced, providing conducting forces for development and prosperity throughout the region”.
China says it now has data that trade with SCO member countries has surpassed "the objectives that had been set," and the communications and transport network was "widely improved", with a land of land of almost 14,000 kilometers among the Member States.
On Monday, Xi Jinping also pointed out that China was the first country to “present the vision of global governance based on a wide consultation, a joint contribution and benefit sharing,” making an “effort to practice true multilateralism”.
"We deepen cooperation with the United Nations and other international organizations, and play a constructive role in international and regional affairs. We are always alongside international equity and justice, we advocate inclusion and mutual learning between civilizations. We oppose the hegemonism and policy of power, so we become a pro-action for peace and world development," said Chinese President.
Hand in hand
Prior to the official photo shoot on Monday, Russian presidents Vladimir Putin, and India Narendra Modi were seen walking hand in hand in the direction of Xi Jinping, with whom they kept a brief conversation, accompanied by interpreters. According to Modi himself, the two leaders traveled together in the same car for their bilateral meeting.
Created in 2001 as a European-Asian security alliance between China, Russia and four Central Asian countries, SCO has expanded areas such as economic and commercial cooperation. According to Beijing, the organization currently brings together 26 countries in Asia, Europe and Africa, between full members, observers and dialogue partners. Myanmar and Türkiye are among the countries intended to full adhesion.
Despite the growing influence, the group is still affected by internal disputes - such as India and Pakistan, or between Tajiquistan and Kyrguistan - that compromise its global effectiveness.

In a report by Lusa agency, there are details of the “MPOP” style of the election campaign, with a lot of music and requests for financial support to the mixture
 
Crowded audience, all dressed in the gowns on the list with which they compete for the elections on the 14th; Chinese drums next to the stage and above candidates and supporters, various microphones, music and choreography. This is the campaign for Macao legislatures, in a style that can be called "MPOP".
The microphones change hands, reproducing the same slogans with different voices, in short and acute scales, which end almost all in a party instruction. At this point, the drums are listened to loudly and the audience reproduces the last note heard, while shaking the political 'merchandising' that is handed over to the start of the rally: plastic hands to clap, numbers on the list with led lights, malleable straws, fans, all with the same color.
Campaign actions in Macao, restricted to the last two weeks before legislative elections for the local parliament, do not contain speeches in the events of the six lists that will elect 14 of the 33 deputies to the Legislative Assembly (AL).
The remaining 12 candidates are chosen through the associations, through the indirect suffrage, and there are still seven deputies appointed by the Chief Executive, in this case Sam Hou Fai.
Describing campaign events is like an exercise of musical shows, namely the genus "Kpop", among the lists led by younger candidates, or the genre "pop old-myle", as if it was figures like Elvis or Olivia Newton John Risen.
The concentrations are made up of the members of the lists and the people mobilized by them, some and the other dresses with the same uniforms. But there are no politicians on stage and viewers listening to them.
In these events, politicians seem to be assumed as artists, but there are no audiences, because they seem to be part of the choreography. Finally, there are very few people besides and each other, that is, people watching who are not directly linked to the lists.
Abstention is the great ghost that hangs over the whole process, which takes place for the first time under the framework of the new Electoral Law of April 2024, which aims to "reinforce the implementation of the" Macao Macao governed by Patriotas "principle.
Economic challenges
Ilia Chou, 40, an employee of the financial sector, was with a child and a friend watching one of these rallies and seemed to be one of those few people present not involved in the campaign list. He agreed to talk to Lusa after he had spoken to another microphone.
Ilia was attracted to the list that was there because those people have a "young and community aspect" and are concerned with "offering prospects for progress" to young people. "Given the current challenging economic climate, we face a critical question: our young people now have fewer options than before. This specific aspect is what attracts me most in this initiative," he said.
But “other groups also talk about youth and employment, what are the differences? Why do you like this particular group?” We asked. "I don't know them [the other groups]. Well, I was attracted to the charming characters of this list," he replied. "I think these four characters quite charming," Ilia added, they talk about "love, the title is very charming, and the color is pink, it looks very welcoming."
Political programs are, without exception, lists of requests to an “provider father”, incarnated by the executive, who has the responsibility of managing a comfortable and growing financial reserve, fueled by taxes paid by the six game dealers in Macao.
The numbers show this comfort. In August, the Macao Financial Reserve, which was always growing throughout the first half, reached 647.3 billion patacas, and was applied in subcontracted investments, deposits, current accounts, and credit securities.
Lists want to be applied to initiatives such as the creation of a development fund and the reversal of 10 percent profits for distribution by all citizens, want to increase pensions or more money in consumer coupons, subsidies and maternity licenses, want more social housing, want free health and higher education, or simply require greater annual money distribution.
Masses for the masses
There are also other demands, such as promoting the diversification of the economy, measures to support the transformation and modernization of small and medium enterprises or intelligent city development, but the most significant part of the six lists programs points directly to the distribution of money from the government in the most varied forms.
The other recipients of the requests are the game dealers, to which the candidates go with warnings that they are determined to defend the priority of residents in access to the best paid jobs.
Macao's unemployment rate is 2 percent and permanent residents at 2.6 percent. That is, technically, Macau has full employment. However, as Lusa told a candidate, the employment issue has nothing to do with statistics, it just holds on with "perception."
And in fact the question of unemployment, especially those who have just graduated, is a pressing issue of political programs, as HM indicated. This is the case of the first list to compete for direct suffrage, the “Association of United Citizens of Macao”, which is led by Song Pek Kei, a deputy linked to the Fujian community, who took the first steps in politics alongside businessman Chan Meng Kam.
The list led by the deputy asks, for example, the creation of a share for residents in all professional areas, “support for employment and local companies”, and the guarantee that “85 percent, or more, employees are local residents”.
The Nova Esperança list, led by José Pereira Coutinho, and one of the few macanese participants in these elections, asks for “employment for all”, a slogan present in his electoral program where the “employment priority for Macao's permanent residents is promised at game dealers”.
Who goes out to their
List campaigns for indirect suffrage may seem more discreet, but that doesn't mean there is no news. After investing in Global Media, Portugal, and betting on the real estate area, in Porto, Kevin Ho, the nephew of the first chief executive, Edmund Ho, bet on local politics, when entering the list “Union of Macao Business Interests”, led by José Chui Sa Peng. Also he is familiar, in this case, from a previous head of the Executive of MSAR, Chui Sai On, already removed from the political scene.
In the case of these lists, representative of the sectors of labor, culture, education or business interests, employment is a concern, but what the candidates are looking for is a government that can support companies and finally diversify the economy.
Thus, in the “union of business interests of Macao”, it is advocated “support for digital and high technology transformation to modernize traditional industries and develop emerging sectors”. Candidates promise to play the role of intermediaries between those who have difficulty maintaining in this business fabric and the executive by “listening carefully to the difficulties and claims of the commercial and financial industries, especially small and medium enterprises”. The names of the seven appointed deputies are not yet known, as the Chief Executive's choice is usually made public only after the elections.

However, the executive refuses that the demolished building falls into this category, because it has not been classified
 
The government defended the demolition of a building in paragraph 10 of the Patio do Espinho, after the fall of part of the structure facade. The position was taken through the response to a written interpellation of Deputy Leong Hong Sai, linked to the residents of Macao.
In questioning, the legislator addressed the case to defend the need to ensure that urban renewal in the city is put into practice, while legislation is produced to ensure that “traditional historical constructions, in favor of maintaining the city's history and cultural ties”.
In the response, signed by the director of the Soil Services and Urban Construction Directorate (DSSCU), Lai Weng Leong, the executive defends the demolition, considering that the infrastructure was not protected, which removes conservation obligations. This option was taken after the Cultural Institute (IC) was heard.
"Building number 10 located in Travessa Três do Pátio do Espinho, after its collapse, was classified as being imminent in ruin and, after consulted the opinion of the IC, DSSCU proceeded, for public security reasons, to its demolition on August 8, 2025, which is currently completed," he was explained. "The IC stated that the aforementioned building is not part of the classified real estate, and these types of constructions must be regulated by the respective legal regulation in force on normal urban constructions," he was added.
More than 600
Lai Weng Leong also quotes the data provided by the IC to indicate that the “current 165 macao -classified real estate items” are related to “more than 600 buildings”.
At the same time, the IC also denies having responsibilities in the degrading state of the demolished building, as it is not part of the supervised heritage, as it is not protected. "Over the years, the IC is always based on the Cultural Heritage Settlement Law, having proceeded, each semester of the year, the verification and supervision of the security of ancient cultural relics in Macao, seeking to learn about their general preservation status and successfully stimulate and stimulate the owners to perform the necessary maintenance work," was justified.
Regarding maintenance work by the owners, it is explained that the IC has a support service for private ones when they do works in their protected heritage have guidelines for “maintenance of outer appearance”, through the issuance of “technical opinions”, but also other supports “to perform restoration and maintenance works”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Sanctions | Japanese deputy forbidden to enter Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/sancoes-deputado-japones-proibido-de-entrar-em-macau/</link><description>The Central Government Ministry has decreed that Japanese deputy Seki Hei is prevented from entering Macao due to the application of a sanction related to comments on issues such as the islands disputed between China and Japan, Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and historical events.

The retreat was published on Sunday through a statement on the company portal, and the most expensive tickets include greater capacity.
Initially Air China -controlled carrier applied new limits, with economic tickets to include a single bag with a limit of 23 kilograms. If they were outdated, passengers would have to pay extra amount.
In the Joyful class, the company's second cheapest, the maximum capacity was increased to 23 kilograms per bag, with passengers carrying up to two bags. Finally, in the business class, customers were limited to two bags, but each with a maximum weight of 32 kilograms.
In addition, the initial rules also mentioned that the size per bag would be limited to 158 centimeters (total length, height and width and included from wheels and handle).
With better
However, on Sunday night, the company retreated by improving the cheaper ticket conditions, but penalizing the intermediate class of tickets, given the original changes. From September 17, the economic class is limited to a single bag with 32 kilograms instead of the original 25 pounds.
For Joyful Class customers, a limit of 50 kilograms in the total of the two bags emerges. However, one bag can reach a weight of 32 pounds, saying that the other does not go beyond 18 pounds.
In the business class the weight of each of the two bags will be 32 kilograms, in a total of 64 kilograms, with no changes. The restrictions of the dimensions were totally abandoned.
The scenario does not fail to contrast with what currently happens. Until September 17 there are no limits in the number of bags. For example, economic clients have a 25 -pound limit, which means they can take more than one suitcase as long as it does not exceed this weight. Customers of the most advanced economic class, Joyful, have a 30 -pound limit while business class customers have a 40 -pound limit.

On the first weekend to use the discount valleys issued within the latest round of the major consumption award, traders said revenues grew around 10 percent. The numbers were pointed out by several traders in statements cited by the newspaper or Mun.
To the Chinese language newspaper, the owner of an unidentified bakery acknowledged that usually on the weekend sales volume is negatively affected by residents' travels to the interior of China. However, due to the discount program that can be used for purchases, the owner stated that the weekend revenues showed 10 percent growth, compared to periods without discounts.
The owner also indicated that, to take advantage of discounts, the store tries to have its own more attractive promotions, and also with the launch of new products, which is expected to arouse greater interest from customers.
In turn, the first -need product store manager indicated that the latest discounts contributed to the number of people to visit the space to increase by about 20 percent.
However, he explained that people opt for the most necessary goods, without major expenses, such as toilet paper or personal and cleaning products for the home. Also in this case, success is not only attributed to the discounts of the initiative promoted by the government, the store also offers more attractive prices.
More flexibility
Despite the satisfaction of merchants, consumer levels arise as requests for greater flexibility, thinking of people with less economic capacity. In the Macao Macao Forum program of Macao's Chinese channel of some listeners to ask for more flexibility on time and in the use of discount coupons.
A nickname Chan listener pointed out that the fact that coupons can only be used on the weekend is negative, because it always creates lines in the most popular stores. Chan considered that the experience of using discounts is bad, and that it should be possible to use discounts during the days of the week.
Chan argued not to understand the resistance to make minor adjustments, according to the opinions of consumers, as several rounds of the program have already been performed.
Another nickname listener Leong suggested the use of coupons on Friday. However, Leong warned the authorities to the possibility of the program leading to increased inflation in local commerce, so he requested an increase in prices by the authorities.
In turn, a listener of nickname Law indicated that the program promoted by the government fails to think of people with less financial capacity. Law has exemplified that for students and the elderly it is difficult to use 200 -Patacas discount coupons because this value can only be used when at least 600 patacas spend.</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 23:45:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Burla |  “Dating” online cost 700 thousand patacas</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/burla-namoro-online-custou-700-mil-patacas/</link><description>A man lost 700,000 patacas, after making several payments hoping to receive sexual services from a woman she met online. The case was reported by the Judicial Police (PJ) and quoted yesterday by the newspaper or Mun.
The resident is a “middle -aged” man who met the alleged woman in June this year, through an application of meetings. After a few weeks of conversation, the woman made herself available to go out with the man and provide her “sexual services” in exchange for money. The man agreed with the proposal and made a bank transfer to the woman.
However, he always stated that he had never received the money. The man was repeating the transfers between June 17-30 until reaching 700,000 patacas. At that time, the resident suspected that he had been circumvented and complained. The PJ is investigating the case, but has not made any detention.
Domestic Violence | Housing struggle results in two injured
The Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) was called to intervene after an alleged fight in a housing, which ended with two injured. The case was registered around noon on Praia do Manduco Street, when after screaming the woman was seen out of the building with wounds on her back. The authorities were called to the scene, and the woman was transported to the hospital.
Also the man had to be transported to the hospital. The two have mild injuries, although at the time of the closing of this edition there were no details on the injuries of both. The exchange of aggression will have involved the use of white weapons so the case is being investigated by the authorities.
Crime | Burlated man in 300 thousand patacas
A “middle -aged” local man was circumvented in 300,000 patacas, after being convinced by burns who was being investigated in the countryside. According to information from the Judicial Police (PJ), the burns binded the man to pass the interior authorities.
During the call they accused him of having practiced slogans inside and told him that he was being investigated. To proceed with the investigation, they asked the man to provide his bank details, which allowed his accounts to access.
The man did not suspect anything, believed he was being investigated and revealed the information requested. However, two days after the so -called telephone call found that 300,000 patacas had been removed from his account. After the bank transfer, he filed a complaint to the Judicial Police.</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 02:28:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Glory Elevator | Sam Hou Fai Solidarity with victims</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/elevador-da-gloria-sam-hou-fai-solidario-com-vitimas/</link><description>The chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, sent a letter to the President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, to express grief and solidarity with victims of the elevator of the Glory.

On Thursday night, the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) of Macau stressed any request for information or assistance, related to the accident, by residents of the territory.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Fine unconsciousness (i)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/09/multar-a-inconsciencia-i/</link><description>Last August 15, the emergency management office of the new Dapeng district, Shenzhen, in mainland China, instructed Nan'ao's office to implement a fine based on the “regulations on the establishment of the first natural disasters prevention decree in Shenzhen Dapeng, China”. It was a measure taken for the first time in the mainland China under these regulations.
The media reported that the 19th of July, two tourists visiting Shenzhen, in mainland China, ignored the Typhoon warning and entered a dangerous area during a blue alert issued by the meteorology office at the time of Wipha's passage. At that moment, they asked the police for help. They had entered the rail at 10.30 h and called the authorities at 20.00, when the Typhoon Yellow Alert had already been raised.
After receiving the request for help, the rescue and fire fighting brigade from the new Dapeng district and the Fire Fighting Brigade in the Nan'ao Forest led the rescue operations at night, having been able to locate the two men at 2.30 pm the next day. However, the typhoon continued to approach, forcing the teams to remain on the mountain. Finally they returned to the rail around 7.40 h, when the typhoon sign had already increased to orange, approximately 12 hours after the warning was issued.
The two men claimed to be outdoor hiking enthusiasts. They only had lanterns and groceries and had no power bank. When they called the police, the mobile phones had only 5 percent battery.
Subsequently, Nan'ao's office fined them under the “Regulation for the Prevention and Control of Natural Disasters in Shenzhen Special Economic Zone,” forcing each to pay 5,000 RMB. This was the first time in China that someone was fined under a regulation to prevent natural disasters.
The regulation, which entered into force on November 1, 2023, indicates the areas with the potential for the occurrence of natural disasters, which may endanger lives or goods under certain circumstances and imposes restrictions on entries. Transgressors are subject to fines between 5,000 and 20,000 RMB and should cover the costs of rescue operations.
In Macau there are similar situations. This year, during the passage of Typhoon Wipha, two tourists were strolling at the Governador Carvalho Bridge. After a resident warned, the judicial police arrived quickly and withdrew the two men. Subsequently, they were fined under the traffic regulation because they ignored the “sign of prohibition to cross the bridge”.
In Hong Kong, there is the law of natural parks. Although explicitly prohibits the entrances during the Tapfan passage, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, for safety reasons, will issue the “walking safety guidelines” and will close some recreational areas. These measures aim to prohibit residents from entering the natural parks during the passage of typhoons, and penalizing transgressors with fines and eventually with a penalty up to 14 days in prison.
These legislations share a guiding thread: the penalty of those who enter delimited and signaled areas with the warning “no entry is not allowed.” However, there is no legislation to regulate the practice of dangerous activities during natural disasters, such as pursuit of typhoons and surfing.
We will continue our analysis next week, which will focus on the regulation of these risk activities.

This is because the increasing number of homeless in the streets of the country's capital increases from month to month and is the greatest shame for state social support. I remember that President Marcelo, at the beyond his term of office, tried, “dreaming”, ending the homeless. He visited several places where the dumps of society were sheltered, spoke to them, was very sensitized and after checking the setbacks to end with shame, the President of the Republic was never heard of such a desiderate. The homeless people are sleeping on the street for a variety of reasons.
Unemployment, death or abandonment of parents, drugs, dumping of residence, divorce and sequence of prison. We talked, with great difficulty, with several homeless and they all repeated the same thing: enjoying having a little house. It is the eternal problem of lack of public housing when there are thousands of millions for the absurd Alcochete Airport.

P.S. - I wish director Carlos Morais José and all who work in this newspaper my congratulations for the 24th anniversary passage.</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 02:47:36</pubDate></item><item><title>24 years old - Are you you entertained?</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/05/24-anos-are-you-entertained/</link><description>Today our newspaper reaches the reckless age of 24 years. But readers are not frightening that I will not toast them with an accurate reflection on the passage of time, the harms of luck and fate, or the deletions of the experience gained. On the contrary, what I really want is to resolutely make my feet on the ground, look at the present around and, shyly, sober, gently, speculate about what the future reserves us.
And they are tweezers what we need to lift the infected skin layers that overshadow us today what we could consider reality. Finally, we came clearly (because, after all, we were already there) to the point where no word, no statement, no discourse, carry in themselves more than their performance value. When you thought you lived in a world sustained by the value of discourse - for it is not a sine qua non of democracy? -It becomes evident the dying value of what is said, which quickly fits into what is actually done.
Never the distance between word and act was so pornographic. And why? Because, for the predominant values, this is unimportant.
In the West, the return of fascism fears. And as you fear, it grows up. There is a single reason for this permission to grow, to infect, propagate evil and iniquity: neo-fascists do not think, it does not go through their minds, move the economic model, so they are not a danger to the system.
See in Italy the Meloni case. Its rearrangement is cosmetic, from circus buffers, designed to limit the possibilities of social transformation that technology today allows, by imposing political-moral restrictions, but never a change in economic assumptions, nor on which wealth flows into the pockets of some.
From an economic point of view, neo -fascists are neoliberal, as they know that the unruly market will provoke concentration in the hands of a few and they will be there to report the others.
Neoliberalism is also adept at strength and relentlessness to the weaker. In their ideal world, the strong and the weak survive not even a place in the shadow, other than the shadow of the corporation, as long as their presence motivates some profit. We heard Jeff Bezos say that he liked his employees with "fear" every day, every time. This expresses well what the ideal world of neoliberalism is, in which not everyone has the right to full humanity and only those who are potentially capable of producing profit is granted the status of close human.
And so we come to a time when technology allows us another kind of work relationships and when physical work finds less and less room to exist. But it is with this mental vector - selfish, war, based on the competition and destruction of the other - that we will address this admirable new world? Probably.
And while we have been outraged to try to save achievements that we judged inalianable, the current neoliberal economic system, which disgraced the well-being of the European and American middle class, is not in question. On the contrary, in the face of the clumsy of politicians in power, various ways are taken: first, vote for the far right that emerges as false opposition to decades of neoliberal default and corruption; Second, withdrawal to the "mountain" from which it is disgusted the unfolding of events without intending to take any part in them; Third, total submersion in the universes of social networks, where today resides entertainment.
And, by the way, are you entertained? You must be because if you are not, you will make Scroll even again with something that will fix your attention in the next 30 seconds. Then you will move to another and so on, fully entertained.
Are you you entertained?, Shouted the gladiator of the movie for the audience, after felling a few colleagues on the sands of any coliseum. Look at people, look at you, and how difficult you are not constantly seeking this entertainment. As your attention is subdued to the mobile phone and the incessant flow of…. (Each will fill with one or more words from their alvitre) who parades there. This is more protruding in the generation that was already born by mobile phone in hand and under the eyes, making his perception of the world something rectangular.
Bread and Circus: There were always the two faces of the currency of oppression, for power knows that we do not live without one, nor without another. And so they give us, as the needs of the market, that is, the needs of those who control it.
But the expensive readers are not afflicted that entertainment will not lack. Among millions of others, we will also be here to entertain you with information, culture and other things. As usual, to the extent of our impossibilities, whose dimension is a colossus, capable of blushing his brother from Rhodes, unfortunately for a long time in the blue abyss of the Mediterranean.

And everything that happened is related not only to our old acquaintance of the Azores, but also to the topography of Africa in the latitude of the Cape Verdean islands and the simultaneity of certain meteorological and oceanographic circumstances. In order to begin the formation of a tropical depression, which may or may not evolve in the sense of its intensification, giving rise to tropical storm and, later, the hurricane1, it is necessary that the ocean surface temperature is relatively high (statistically equal to or greater than 27ºC), that there is a small disturbance in the field of atmospheric pressure (a voucher designated by “wave of the east”) Vertical of this disturbance varies little with altitude (shear, or Wind Shear, weak).
The simultaneity of these circumstances occurred in the early hours of August 11, 2025, which caused the death of nine people and transformed many homes and infrastructure into wreckage, on the island of São Vicente.
In addition to the natural factors mentioned, they also contributed to this calamity the weak memory that characterizes human beings, regarding meteorological phenomena, and the fact that the National Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics (INMG - Cape Verde Meteorological Authority) has no strategically placed meteorological radars to proceed to a more efficient surveillance of systems evolution meteorological. If the authorities remembered that such situations have already occurred, although sporadically, they would probably not allow the construction of houses on the beds and banks of the almost permanently dry streams. But nature does not forgive and, whenever it rains intensely, the water drips to the lower areas, resuming paths already traveled, that is, the beds of these streams.
During the dawn of this day, after many of the inhabitants of Mindelo became fun at the characteristic parties of August, a tropical depression caused heavy rain, especially in the islands of São Vicente and Santo Antão. The amount of hasty water reached 192.3 mm in just 5 hours, higher than the average annual precipitation, which corresponds to about 38 5 liters of water to fall on the surface of 1 m² during this period, practically throughout the island of São Vicente.
It rains little in Cape Verde, but when it rains, it sometimes happens with great intensity, usually by the action of weather disturbances designated by east waves or tropical depressions that derive from them, and can evolve into tropical storms and hurricanes. Some of these meteorological systems that occur in the North Atlantic begins in the vicinity of Cape Verde, a country consisting of an archipelago located in the North Atlantic Ocean, approximately between the 15th and 17th N and the Meridians 22nd and 26th West, formed by two subgroups: Satellian Islands (Santo Antão, St. Vincent, Santa Luzia, Saint North and Boavista) of parallel 16 N and islands of empowerment (May, Santiago, Fogo and Brava), south of the same parallel.
The archipelago suffers almost permanently, especially the islands of Well, Northeast winds, the so -called high winds, relatively dry due to the part of the route to occur over the Sahel. These winds, which blow in the southeast edge of the Azores anticyclone, sometimes carry sand and dust of the Sáara that arrive in Cape Verde and beyond, crossing a large length of the Atlantic.
In turn, the southeast winds that, due to the rotation of the Earth inflate to the southwest after crossing the Ecuador (Coriolis effect), associated with the almost permanent anticyclone of Santa Helena, located in the South Atlantic, more humid converges with the northeast executions, giving rise to an area designated by Intertropical Convergence Zone (Intertropical Convergence Zone - Zone - Zone - Zone - Zone - Zone - Zone - Itcz). In this area, due to the convergence of the two types of heights, the air is required to rise giving rise to the condensation of water vapor and the formation of clouds often vertical development, designated by cumulonimbus, characterized by strong precipitation and thunderstorms. This zone of convergence moves throughout the year, following the apparent movement of the sun, with some delay, reaching the northern latitude in August/September, regressing south as the year advances, reaching the lower latitude in December/January. The weather conditions in Cape Verde are mainly determined by ITCZ's position in relation to the archipelago. Thus, the rainy season (August, September and October) occurs when ITCZ ​​is north, and the dry season covers the months from April to June, being July the month of transition. You can also consider the months from November to March as an intermediate station.
During the rainy season, sometimes east waves are formed in the southern regions of ITCZ, due in part to the action of the mountains in Africa, which introduce disorders into the air flow, progressing from east to west between latitudes 5º and 20º N, covering the region where Cape Verde is located.
One of these waves of east was formed on August 9 and evolved into tropical depression. When the sustained maximum winds reached 34 knots (63 km/h) depression went to the category of tropical storm with the name Erin2 on August 11, having evolved to hurricane on the 15th. Later, on August 16, reached category 5, the strongest of the Saffir-Simpson3 hurricane scale.
When it caused the greatest damage in Cape Verde, the weather system was not yet attributed, which only happened when tropical depression evolved into tropical storm. Its route followed approximately the designated path, in the meteorological media, by “Cape Verde route”, which consists of a route around the Azores anticyclone, near Cape Verde, progressing west, northwest, northern, recurring to the northeast, and may reach Europe as an extratropical depression.
The well-known singer Bana (pseudonym of Adriano Gonçalves), the “king of warm”, in the song “Sina de Cape Verde”, expressed well the hardness of the climate of his country: “Si Ka Ten Txuba, Morê Di Sedi, Si Txuba Ben, Morrê Fogade” (if there is no rain dies thirst, if the rain comes drowned).
Also Manuel Lopes4, long before Bana, portrayed in his soap opera “The Flagellates of the East Wind”, the tragedy, although, opposite, the Cape Verdean people for long periods of drought.

Tropical cyclones, before reaching the hurricane classification, passes through several phases, depending on wind velocity: tropical depression, tropical storm and hurricane (typhoon in northwestern Pacific and China Sea). When the maximum sustained winds are equal to or greater than 34 nodes (63 km/h) tropical depression passes the tropical storm (Tropical Storm). When equal to or greater than 64 knots (119 km/h), it takes the name of hurricane, typhoon, or cyclone, according to the regions. In the case of Northwest Pacific and Southern Sea of ​​China, there is still an intermediate category, between the tropical storm and the typhoon, which is the severe tropical storm, when the maximum sustained winds reach equal or higher values ​​48 nodes (88 km/h) and less than 64 knots. The depression system only begins to be designated by an international name when reaching the tropical storm category. In the case of Northwest of the Pacific and Southern Sea of ​​China, the names are attributed by Escap/WMO Typhoon Committee, whose secretariat has been based in Macao since 2007.
In the Atlantic, the names are attributed by the Hurricane Committee, whose secretariat is based in Miami.
On the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, these meteorological systems are classified based on the speed of the maximum winds sustained within 1 minute:
Category 1 - 64 to 82 nodes (119–153 km/h)
Category 2 - 83 to 95 knots (154–177 km/h)
Category 3 - 96 to 113 knots (178–208 km/h)
Category 4 - 114 to 135 knots (209–251 km/h)
Category 5 -&gt; 135 knots (&gt; 250 km/h)

Tapah's passage "Tapah" has already forced some adjustments on the agenda, namely the cancellation yesterday of the activity "a sea in the old house of orchids", while the show "Orchids to the Old House", originally expected to take place on Sunday, takes place at 6 pm on Yuan Coffee.
But there is much more to see: near Rua do Cunha, Taipa, between tomorrow and Friday, from 15h, there is the performance "To Survive in Cities", from the group "Co.Scoopp", from Japan.
With the direction of Asami Yasumoto and music by Sachie Fujisawa, the performance lasts 25 minutes and has a "group of white, cute and mysterious creatures that, in the name of us survivors, oscillates around the city in search of a direction." So the question is, "Should you follow the crowds to forge or open your own way?" This group comes from Japan and assumes to contribute “to the development of contemporary performance arts through creative and experimental activities in the new contemporary circus genre”.
Discovered
Also from tomorrow, and until September 21st, the free and interactive activity “Vela Shine: Exhibition of Installation of Urban Sounds”, with artists Calvin Lam, Shadow Fong, Kaze Chan and Chloe Lao. It is a “night walk to discover the hidden sparkles around the city”, between 5 pm and 11 pm, in a route traced by a mobile phone application where participants are led to become “urban explorers, walking through streets and alleys to discover almost invisible miniatures and songs that keep memories and stories”.
Within digital and interactive experiences, the “Adventure Book‘ a hidden window in Macau ’-version with musical accompaniment”, a Kaze Chan project, Chikara Fujiwara, Minori Sumiyoshiyama and Erik Kuong. Between Wednesday and September 21st, there is a route to digitally explore between the parishes of São Lázaro, Santo António and São Lourenço, between 10am and 23h, where an application is needed. This "book" was created by the Japanese artistic collective "Orangcosong", which is a reinvention "from the city through books, games and theater, offering a new and exciting way to explore Macau". The "book" has four predefined routes.
On the same dates, there is also the activity “daily to Deriva - theater of the urban tour”, in the same zones of the peninsula.

Through the treadmill, there are plastic rugs where the audience can run, skateboard and bike. The nine screens hanging above the installation display live images of the place and scenes of pre-recorded life, and the audience can also send their own videos to create a lively theater of life together. “This work transforms cultural spaces and artistic scenes into an experimental field for social behavior, highlighting the idea that the journey of life and art has no end and suggesting the fluidity of life, memory and identity,” describes the IC.

Finally, the British Interdisciplinary Assembly Collective, known for revitalizing urban spaces through community and creative design, presents “goods and warriors”, a project that “serves to reflect on the relationship between land and people”.

Thus, it is exploited “the symbiotic relationship between earth and humanity through the display of documents and the holding of public events, thus creating an emotional connection between Earth and the public of Macao”, describes the IC.
With “goods and warriors”, it presents a “upward perspective” of the connection of agriculture with people and the “unique value of the small-scale agricultural economy for ecological balance, community resilience and economic stability, challenging the preconceived idea of ​​'urban centrism' and also re-examining the construction role of rural practices in the construction of a sustainable future”.
“Goods and Warriors” is also available for public visit until December 12 this year, aiming to “establish a link between land, food and human senses and develop a new dialogue between the urban audience and the agricultural landscapes that nourish it, at the same time offering a visual validation for the cultural value and the survival wisdom necessary for future urban development in the growing uncertain uncertainties of globalization”.</description><pubDate>2025-09-09 00:03:13</pubDate></item><item><title>FINAM | Cuca Roseta acts next to the Chinese orchestra of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/fimm-cuca-roseta-actua-ao-lado-da-orquestra-chinesa-de-macau/</link><description>This year's Macao International Music Festival poster brings Portuguese fadista Cuca Roseta, who goes on stage next to the Macao Chinese Orchestra, in a fusion of sounds that is no longer new to Macao.

Still, Max Richter, Germano-British composer, used “a distinct musical language, having rebuilding the work inspired by minimalism, post-classical textures and electronic music”. In this work of composition, "the melodies of Vivaldi's composition emerge, disappear and reappear unexpectedly, creating a Sódic landscape that is both astonishingly familiar and surprisingly new."

The party takes place between 17h and 11pm and brings to the Van Nam factory, on Olympic Avenue, on the mud, “a avant -garde world of makeshift musical action, video installations and an innovative modular synthesizer workshop,” says Noyb on social networks.
Thus, “visionary artists from Macao, Portugal, Spain, Japan and other places are joined in the mud, creating a unique tapestry of sounds and visual art”, and there will be no shortage of gastronomy spaces and the “company of other art enthusiasts” to make music and enjoy it.
The poster is made with Logoss, which acts the day before in Beishan, Zhuhai; DJ Sniff, Larsq, Ezara Thustra and DJs Tongrim and Fon.
Experimental maneuvers
Regarding the artistic path of the participants at this Experimentation Party, Fon was born in Canton, Guangzhou, but was created in Macao. However, he also lived in New York and Los Angels, where he worked as a musician and conceptual artist. “Its diverse formation inspires the exploitation of sound, visual arts, performance and improvisation,” says Noyb. Fon's musical taste is also "strongly influenced by New York Vanguardists, such as H0L0 and Bossa Nova Civic Club, as well as the" Underground "scene of parties in Macao and the song Trap Cantonense."
Also noteworthy is the sound project “Larsq”, by Rui Rasquinho, designer and illustrator of Lisbon that has long made Macau to his home. With "Larsq" the public can enjoy "pedals of effects, noise synthesizers and a guitar under the influence of improvisation, situated somewhere between the abstract and narrative."
In the case of DJ Sniff, it is a musician, curator and educator whose work “is done with different practices that combine 'djing, instrument design and free improvisation”. DJ Sniff has worked in Amsterdam and was a visiting assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong University between 2012 and 2017. He has collaborated with names like Evan Parker, Otomo Yoshihide, Paul Hubweber, Tarek Atoui, Senyawa and Ken Ueno.
From Spain, more concretely Tenerife, the Lagoss project comes, and its presentation is immediately warned: listening to these sounds can "cause involuntary wandarings by islands that do not exist."
Logoss is therefore an "audiovisual project whose sound goes beyond the spectrum of what our ears are used to," inspired by "exotic mythologies and spiritual sounds." Thus, “immersive sound landscapes that challenge any simple categorization” are created, with a song that is “a singular fusion of synthesizer cosmic explorations, unstable dub rhythms and imagined island field recordings, all sustained by a healthy dose of psycho-psycho, improvisation and 'live looping' of electronic and acoustic instruments”.
In this way, the audience can see, listen and feel tomorrow "a particular sound and organic universe, which the band itself describes as the island folklore of the future or cyber-tropicalism."</description><pubDate>2025-09-05 00:24:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Kiang Wu | Hospital plans expansion of the museum</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/09/kiang-wu-hospital-planeia-expansao-do-museu/</link><description>Kiang Wu Hospital Director Ung Pui Kun has revealed that it is planning to expand the museum to be able to display more content.

Still, "the astronomical tide in combination with Storm comes up, raised the water level about 1 meter maximum height and the registered tide was 3.7 meters."
In the summary of the SMG, it was indicated that Tapah was a challenge in predictability due to its "small circulation, winding trajectory and proximity to Macau".

Last year, 151 cases were investigated through regional collaboration mechanisms
 
The Special Administrative Regions of Macau and Hong Kong signed an agreement with the Guangdong Province authorities that provides for the reinforcement of the coordination in joint operations to combat trafficking in scholars. The decision was made at the first anti -drug conference in the Great Bay area, held in Hong Kong, according to EFE news agency.
The meeting gathered in Hong Kong responsible for the fight against the drug trafficking of the three regions and Singapore to address the growing complexity of drug trafficking.
After 18 months of coordinated actions, the authorities of the three regions of southern China also proceeded to 512 arrests, in addition to the seizure of drugs, the Hong Kong government said.
China Ministry of Public Security Narcotics Director General Wei Xiaojun said regional collaboration allowed to investigate 151 relevant cases since 2024, with significant results. Wei warned, however, to the “deep changes” in the global panorama of drugs, such as the appearance of new substances, including Ethomidate, classified in Hong Kong as dangerous drug since February, at cocaine level.
"The area of ​​the Great Bay, with advanced economy and transportation calls, is a fundamental target for international cartels," he said. Wei promised the full support of the central government to facilitate communication and the flow of people in the fight against drug trafficking.
UNITED FRONT
Hong Kong Security Secretary Chris Tang highlighted a 40 percent drop in the number of drug consumers between 2015 and 2024, attributed to transionic cooperation.

In the same line, Guangdong Narcotics Control Commission vice-director Liang Ruiguo and Macao Police Commissioner-General Leong Man-Cheong supported a more robust joint approach.
Hong Kong's head of the administration, Eric Chan, defended the need for innovative strategies in the face of “increasingly sophisticated” methods of criminals.
Secretary Chris Tang stressed the importance of joint work also at the promotion of anti-drug messages directed to the youngest. "Because young people are the main targets of drug traffickers, anti -drug dissemination should reform online and offline communication channels to align with their lifestyle," said China Daily.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails about sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad for us, in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts him a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people, which always seems the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

"I am horrified by the open use of genocidal rhetoric and the shameful dehumanization of Palestinians by senior Israeli employees," said Volker Türk at the opening of the 60th UN Human Rights Council session in Geneva.
The High Commissioner has called for "immediate actions to end the carnage," stating that the international community "is failing in its duty."
“We are failing with the people of Gaza. Where are the decisive measures to prevent genocide? Why are countries not doing more to prevent these atrocious crimes?” He said.
"The region calls for peace. Gaza is a cemetery," said Volker Türk.
The Palestinian territory, besieged by Israel, is devastated and suffering from hunger, according to the UN. The Israeli Army, which claims to control approximately 75 percent of the Gaza Strip and 40 percent of the city of Gaza, indicated its intention to take the latter, the largest city in the north of the Enclave.
The Israeli offensive was launched in the Gaza Strip in response to an attack on Israeli soil on October 7, 2023 by the Palestinian Islamite group Hamas.
Action
"The Palestinian civilian massacres in Gaza by Israel; indescribable suffering and inflicted mass destruction; the obstruction of the supply of adequate humanitarian aid and the consequent hunger of civilians; the murders of journalists, UN employees and non-governmental organizations (NGO), and the warfare crimes," said Türk.
The High Commissioner has called for countries to “interrupt the flow of weapons to Israel, risking infringing war laws;“ to exercise maximum pressure to ensure a ceasefire, the release of hostages and arbitrarily detained people; and the entry of sufficient humanitarian aid in Gaza by all means at his disposal. ”
Türk also asked that the international community will take "decisive measures to oppose the Military Gaza Planned by Israel and the accelerated attachment of the occupied West Bank." Shortly after the return of US President Donald Trump, to the White House, Israel, like the United States, stopped participating in the debates before the Human Rights Council.</description><pubDate>2025-09-09 00:09:39</pubDate></item><item><title>BRICS | Xi Jinping participates in Virtual Summit</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/09/brics-xi-jinping-participa-em-cimeira-virtual/</link><description>China confirmed the participation of Chinese President Xi Jinping, in an extraordinary virtual summit of the Brics Emerging Block, which took place yesterday and was summoned by Brazilian homologous, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The BRICS Group seeks to foster cooperation and solidarity between emerging markets and developing countries, to defend justice and be a stable and positive force in international affairs, at a time when protectionism grows," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian at a press conference.
Lin confirmed that Xi would give a speech at the meeting and that Beijing hopes to "maintain conversations" with other leaders with a view to "new contributions for a multipolar world." According to the Brazilian press, the extraordinary summit was summoned to discuss "threats to the multipolar world order and a common response to tariffs" imposed by the United States.
The meeting takes place in a context of commercial tension with the US, exacerbated by the tariff war driven by the administration of US President Donald Trump. The last summit of the BRICS - a group founded by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - took place in July this year in Rio de Janeiro. It was expected to be held in India in 2026.

Since the commercial truce with the United States reached in May, the Popular Bank of China (Central Bank) has adjusted daily Yuan's reference rate, raising it from 7.19 to 7.13 per dollar to August-an appreciation of about 1 percent. But in the last week of August, the institution accelerated the pace, strengthening the rate by another 300 base points in just five sessions, to 7.10 per dollar.
"If this rhythm remains, Yuan could soon break the symbolic barrier of 7 per dollar," noted the Gavekal Dragonomics.
According to the report, this change coincides with the speech of US Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell in Jackson Hole, where he expressed opening to an interest cut. China's central bank began to fix the strongest yuan the following Monday, although the dollar index (DXY) remained stable, suggesting that the Chinese decision was not directly motivated by foreign exchange markets.
The Think Tank points to several hypotheses for this decision. One is that the Chinese Central Bank expects a tendency to weaken the dollar in the coming months, as markets anticipate lower interest rates in the United States and possible political pressures on Fed's independence by President Donald Trump's administration.
Another possibility is that the appreciation of Yuan serves to “release accumulated pressure” and keep the markets aligned with the signs of the PBOC. This would allow, according to the report, to cut interest later this year without generating abrupt devaluation of the coin.
The gesture may also be interpreted as an attempt to improve the climate in commercial negotiations with the US. "By showing that it is not devaluing Yuan to compensate for the effects of US tariffs, PBOC helps to create a more conducive atmosphere for any agreement," says Gavekal, recalling that Chinese deputy minister of commerce, Li Chenggang, was in Washington between August 27 and 29.</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 23:59:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Visit | Portuguese PM since yesterday to Beijing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/visita-pm-portugues-desde-ontem-a-pequim/</link><description>Luís Montenegro arrived yesterday in Beijing where he will be received by Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The Portuguese Prime Minister landed yesterday in Beijing for an official visit to China that begins today, during which he will have a meeting with President Xi Jinping and will pass Macao, then heading to Japan.
The trip to both countries, with a total of four days of official program, happens nine years after the previous Prime Minister, António Costa, visited China in 2016 and the President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, was in the territory in 2019.
The delegation is the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, Paulo Rangel, - who will have an official meeting with his Chinese counterpart - and the Minister of Economics and Territorial Cohesion, Manuel Castro Almeida, as well as the president of AICEP, Madalena Oliveira e Silva.
The official agenda of the Prime Minister's visit starts today, with a ceremony of deposition of Crown of Flores in the monument to the heroes of the people, in Tiananmen Square, then heading to the great palace of the people.

The visit of the Portuguese Prime Minister to China will take place the week following the meeting in Beijing of Chinese leaders, Xi Jinping, Russian, Vladimir Putin, and North Korean, Kim Jong-un, on a military arrest that marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in the Pacific.
This meeting was classified on Wednesday by the head of European Union diplomacy, Kaja Kallas, as a "direct challenge" to the rules-based international order, which sends "anto-spirit signs."
Source of the Prime Minister's office filed Luis Montenegro's visit to China in Portugal's “diplomatic tradition”, as all heads of state and several prime ministers visited this country, the “second largest economy in the world” and permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
In addition to the political meetings “at the highest level”, in economic terms, the objective is to improve trade balance between the two countries, “strongly unbalanced” in favor of Beijing, and some memorandum of understanding in the agrifooding area should be signed.

NHK television said that Ishiba wants to avoid divisions within the party, while Asahi Shimbun newspaper said the prime minister could no longer resist the growing requests for dismissal. Ishiba, who took office in October, resisted the demands of his opponents, mostly right -wing and his own party, over a month ago.
The Japanese Prime Minister's decision happens a day before his Liberal Democratic party decides whether an early election for leadership if a censorship motion against Ishiba is approved.
In July, Ishiba's government coalition failed to achieve the majority of the High Chamber of Parliament, and the Liberal Democratic Party and the partner Komeito achieved only 46 of the 50 places that had the goal, to join the 75 places they already had.

"I was really tempted to give up in half. Getting to the summit was difficult, but my friends encouraged me and everything went well. I got to the top because many people supported me," Akuzawa told Associated Press (AP) after the climb.
Akuzawa climbed her 70 -year -old daughter, her granddaughter, her husband and four friends from a local climbing club. The climbing group camped for two nights on the track before the top of the highest mountain in Japan, which reaches 3,776 meters on August 5.
"I am impressed to have cast so well," he said, communicating with the help of 75 -year -old daughter Yukiko who repeated questions to her father's ear for having hearing problems. Akuzawa added that at his age, he does not consider any mountain as guaranteed: "It is better to climb while one can," he said.
The trip was not Akuzawa's first record to Mount Fuji. He was 96 years old when he became the oldest person climbing the most famous mountain in the country. In the next six years, he surpassed heart problems, herpes zoster (zone) and pain in climbing.
Akuzawa spent three months training before Fuji's climb, waking up at 5 am for one hour walking and climbing approximately one mountain a week, especially around the Nagano region, west of Gunma, in downtown Japan.
Other arts
Surrounded by family members and framed mountain paintings at his home in Maebashi, about 241 kilometers northwest of Tokyo, Akuzawa recalled what attracted him to the mountains 88 years ago.
Although the magic of reaching the summit is undeniable, it was the people who made him return. “I escape because I like it. It's easy to make friends on the mountain,” he said.
Akuzawa was a competent student and worked as a motor project engineer and later as an artificial cattle inseminator, a profession he kept up to 85, according to his family. Asked if it intends to climb Mount Fugi, the Japanese pointed out that he liked to “climb forever”, but doubts that he gets the feat again.
“I am now at Mount Akagi,” a close summit with about half of Fuji's height, with a 1,828 meters peak. Akuzawa currently spends the mornings as a volunteer in a care center for the elderly and teaching painting at home at home.
Mountaineering and painting require time and dedication, but both offer peace, he stressed. Akuzawa's daughters want him to paint Mount Fuji at the sunrise as the next addition to the representations of mountain ranges that cover the walls of his living room.</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 02:39:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | China “opposes firmly” to any pressure from the US or Europe</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/ucrania-china-opoe-se-firmemente-a-qualquer-pressao-dos-eua-ou-da-europa/</link><description>China said Friday opposing any kind of coercion, after the United States asked European leaders to increase economic pressure on Beijing due to alleged Russian war machine support.

Later, the Portuguese lawyer, Randy Shek Shu Ming, asked the court of appeal to reduce the penalty to four years and four months, stressing that Joseph John had declared himself guilty. Randy Shek is known in Hong Kong for defending defendants linked to 2019 protests, one of the biggest challenges to Beijing authorities since the transfer of power.
But last April, the Court of Appeal refused the Portuguese defense request, concluding that any crime linked to national security that is classified as "serious" implies a minimum penalty of five years.
Judges of the Court of Appeal cited a 2023 judgment of the last court as a basis for this decision.
In Friday's decision, the three judges of the same court used the same justification to reject Joseph John's appeal, also known as Wong Kin Chung. The Portuguese has as its last option to submit a request directly from the court of last instance, which counts among its judges with Lusodescendent Roberto Ribeiro.
Appeals to Independence
Joseph John, an employee of the Royal College of Music in the United Kingdom, has been detained since late October 2022 and, if the sentence remains unchanged, could be released at the end of 2027.
Between July 2020 and November 2022, Portuguese made 42 publications on social networking profiles and on the party's website for Hong Kong's independence, of which he was one of the administrators.
The organization was founded in the United Kingdom in 2015, but the British Electoral Commission revoked the political party status in 2018. The Portuguese asked London to declare that China would be “illegally occupying” Hong Kong, just as he appealed to the United Kingdom and the United States to send troops to the former British colony, whose control passed to Beijing in 1997.
Joseph John also defended “an invasion” from the neighboring city of Shenzhen, to free 12 Hong Kong activists who had tried to flee by boat to Taiwan, a group that included Kok Tsz-Lun, with Portuguese and Chinese nationality.</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 02:35:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Jorge Figueira, architect and academic at the University of Coimbra: “The Heroic Relations” of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/jorge-figueira-arquitecto-e-academico-da-universidade-de-coimbra-as-relacoes-heroicas-de-macau/</link><description>It has long written and thinks architecture, and since time Jorge Figueira, architect, academic at the University of Coimbra, does it in Macau. After a session this week that highlighted the former Fai Chi Kei Public Housing Complex, Manuel Vicente, Jorge Figueira today approaches the Rui Cunha Foundation O Legado de Nuno Portas
 
Today participates in the Conference “Nuno Portas: From Architecture to Urbanism, from man to city”. What legacy did this Portuguese architect have left?
Nuno Portas is someone who in the late 1950s has a critical activity that is totally innovative and pioneer in the Portuguese context. Then, in the 1960s, he had a more international activity, having been the first to publicize the work of Siza Vieira. That's when he had the first contacts with Spanish and Italian architects, fundamentally. Also in these years he wrote two books that were also unusual, such as “Architecture for Today” in 1964, and “City as Architecture” from 1969. They were also an extraordinary way to try to catch what was going on in terms of international currents in architecture. But then there was also a [important] activity as an architect alongside Nuno Teotónio Pereira, namely in the work of the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Lisbon, and in a house in Vila Viçosa. Then, with April 25, 1974, he was appointed Secretary of State for Housing and Urbanism and launches the Saal - Outpatient Services to Local Support, a completely revolutionary social housing program, according to the spirit of the time. Then Nuno Portas devoted himself more to the issues of urbanism and not so much of architecture. He was linked to the beginning of Expo 98. It turns out to be someone who in the last 20 years of his work has more scientific and sociological concerns, and less artistic. It's something you had from the beginning, but then it becomes the hundred of your activity.
Did Nuno Portas have a relationship with Macau?
I think relationships would not be so intense compared to other architects and contexts, but we know that Nuno Portas was in Macao at the government's invitation to a conference between 2001 and 2002. It is interesting because of this passage we have echoes of what happened, as his surprise when discovering the Ellen Liang orphanage of Manuel Vicente, he did not know. It was the first work of Manuel Vicente in Macau, from the 60s, and we know that Nuno Portas was thrilled to visit this work, especially the small chapel that exists in the orphanage. It is interesting because there was no direct relationship between Manuel Vicente and Nuno Portas, they are very different poles figures, and even opposite. There is also an interesting and positive reference to the Siza [Vieira, Expansion Plan of the city of Macao (Areia Preta and Outdoor Port, 1982], and when Nuno Portas visits Macau is being built. It is interesting to have commented on this plan because in the 60s and 70s the relationship between Nuno Portas and Siza Vieira was no longer the same, and the fact that he had made complimentary references to Siza is very interesting.
He was a student of Nuno Portas. What other aspects of your career or personality can highlight?
I also worked with him. He was a cultured man, very intelligent and with an overwhelming memory. It was someone who liked to provoke, but in a good way, to discuss, to counteract. I was lucky enough to maintain a dialogue with him for decades, and this is my personal knowledge that I will convey. I also notice that it was a man very close to the power of Lisbon, the parties, but always very independent. He was a personal friend of Jorge Sampaio, he was secretary of state, but never had great political protagonism. On the one hand, this is due to his independence, but on the other he was such a controversial and intelligently restless figure that I think power was also startled by him.
This week also spoke at the “Lisbon, Porto, Macau, Maputo: Heroic Collective Housing from the 60s &amp; 70s” conference. How do you describe Macau's public housing projects in those years?
There are many architects that I could talk about, but I focused on Manuel Vicente's work in Macau, namely the public housing complex at Fai Chi Kei, which was demolished and then gave rise to the project of Rui Leão and Carlota Bruni. I did not speak concretely about Portuguese or Macanese architects, we also have names such as José Ways. Also because the Portuguese architects have always been few in Portugal, and from the 1950s there were about 150, then greatly increasing in number. But I made [at the conference] a tribute to the Portuguese architects who built during this period, because in a complex territory and with their vicissitudes, different from those that existed in Portugal, they knew how to do architectural experiences in the field of extraordinary public housing. I tried to demonstrate what was happening in Lisbon, Porto, Macao and Lourenço Marques, currently Maputo, in different ways. In Macao, relations were established, which I call heroic, in the sense that they were relations of experimental architecture, in which people had to adapt, to have their own spirit. These are architectures already with a little history, as it has passed 50 or 60 years, but the examples we find in these cities have continued to be remarkable.
What projects highlight these years?
I talked about Gonçalo Byrne's housing development “Pantera Pantera” in Chelas, Lisbon. I showed the “five fingers”, by Vítor Figueiredo, also from Lisbon, and the “Bouça neighborhood”, from Siza Vieira, in Porto. I showed Manuel Vicente's Fai Chi Kei complex and a Pancho Guedes project in Mozambique. Although they are already distant in time, these are architectures that remain fundamental references of the cultural and architectural points of view. There is a kind of narrative luck to be able to talk about such different sites, and with such different architects, and show how they had this heroic, experienced, even radical, experienced side that had the architecture of this particular period.
Has Macao had a positive evolution with regard to public housing supply?
I arrived in August and have been visiting the territory in recent years, so I have been following this process a little. Macao is obviously an extraordinary territory and from the outset by the coexistence of very different cultures regarding housing, which here has a completely different scale and expression of the Portuguese. In Portugal there is an aversion to public housing towers, it has always been unusual and the results that are known have not been successful for various reasons. But in Macao this is exactly what we see, public housing in towers and with a very strong expression. This has to do with the characteristics of the territory and also with a certain culture of China and Hong Kong. This is not to say that everything that is being built in Macau is good, there are towers and buildings with less interesting solutions or that result from a certain repetition. But there is no city that only has good architecture or good public housing. The challenge is to solve the large -scale housing problem, something that must be studied and thought. It is beautiful and overwhelming to see that Macau is a territory that grows day after day and it is exciting to observe this from the point of view of architecture. This is what I am doing, working on future projects.
Analysis projects, or academic?
Yes, I am a teacher and researcher at the University of Coimbra and columnist for the public newspaper, so my work is very much to analyze and investigate. I already published a lot about Macau and I want to resume some ends that I left to solve, let's say. I am very stimulated with everything I have seen and the people I have spoken with, and maybe I will increase my work on the territory from an academic point of view and at the plan of the investigation.
At a time when Portugal has a chronic housing problem, with a lack of public housing, could Macau be an example?
No directly, because of the typological issue of the housing tower. It might not be a welcome model in the Portuguese context. But no doubt Portugal needs to learn from other experiences and other territories and need to find solutions. Surely what happens in Hong Kong and Macau are experiences that are very interested in knowing, not to replicate, but to realize that this is a global problem [the lack of housing].
Remember Nuno Portas
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) receives today, from 6.30 pm, the Conference “Nuno Portas: From Architecture to Urbanism, from man to city”, with Jorge Figueira. It will be time to talk about a route that the newly failed architect began in 1959, with a text about the new generation of the modern movement in Portugal. Texts followed in the 1960s and 70s with “scientific approaches”, with Nuno doors to a walk between architecture and urbanism, always in a reflective way. Nuno Portas was a “multifaceted figure, better known for launching the Saal Social Housing Program, which is still the target of investigation and an example”, describes Jorge Figueira in a note. The speaker is linked to the Center Social Studies and Department of Architecture of the University of Coimbra.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:33:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, Academic: “China is a reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended at the University of Aveiro the doctoral thesis that analyzes how China has been positioned in recent decades as an important actor in the “global health governance”. Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with the global south. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that the willingness already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy.
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages ​​in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary-general guaranteed to have "all the pleasure of working with all parties," but stressed that this is a "decision that is up to the central governments to make" and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, it is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a theme that is being debated in the world worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new fund's new direction "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, in this case, the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibilization of the rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish-speaking institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo.

Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything that someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | Event literature is expected to grow in the coming years</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/01/gp-literatura-do-evento-devera-crescer-nos-proximos-anos/</link><description>The literature on the Macau Grand Prix could continue to grow in the coming years. The release of the Macao Grand Prix-Personal Collection of Victor H. de Lemos, 1954-1978, volume II (1967-1978), by Macaense Carlos Lemos, residing in Toronto since 1974, will take place in November, not in October as initially expected, while a new book on motorcycling provies is forming form.
This change in the date is not related to any delay, but to the date of visit to the territory by the author. Following the success of Volume I, the second part of a book that aims to honor the author's father, Victor Hugo Lemos - an enthusiast of the Macao Grand Prix who, in life, collected a vast number of photographs and everything that was related to the Automobile and Motorcycle Races in Macau since 1954, the date of the first edition of the event.
“This second volume completes a significant part of my father's Macao Grand Prix Collection, Victor H. de Lemos. It is a 356 pages hardcover book, ie 100 more than the first volume,” says Carlos Lemos. “Content and composition are very identical to those of the first volume. Includes more chinese newspaper clippings and documents the first fatal accident, the failed attempt to create the Extreme Orient Automobile Association Circuit, the first edition of the Guide Race, the Giant Race and the gradual evolution of the Macao Grand Prix, from amateur races to a world -class event, recognized by the International Federation. of the car (FIA). ”
Also according to the author, “The book contains about 471 photographs, as well as an introduction to the other collection of my father, World of Motor Racing, composed of over 1900 autographed pilots photographs, car owners and international renowned designers, such as Il Commendatore Enzo Ferrari, Sir Stirling Moss, Michael Schumacher, Roy Salvadori, Dan Gurney, Sir Jack Brabham, Juan Manuel Fangio, Helmut Marko, Colin Chapman, Sir Jackie Stewart, Janet Guthrie, Professor Sid Walkins, Tony and Mary Hulman (owners of the Indianapolis circuit), Frank Williams, Charlie Whiting, Louis Meyer, among others. ”
The first volume sales exceeded expectations and therefore 550 copies will be sold. The cover price will be 400 patacas, but will be marketed for 350 patacas during the promotion period. Part of the liquid product from the sale will revert to the institution IC2 Association - “I Can Too”, which supports people with autism or disability, as well as Apomac. The presentation should take place at the headquarters of the Macao Retirees, Reformed and Pensioners Association (Apomac), at date and time to reveal.
A book about motorcycles
The literature on the Macau Grand Prix could continue to grow in the coming years. Carlos Barreto, the author of the book Karting History in Macau, written in co -authorship with Pedro Dá Mesquita, is considering writing a book about motorcycling in the Macao Grand Prix, a discipline that sometimes ends up in the background in terms of literary coverage of the more than seventy years of the Guide Circuit event.
"The idea is to gather the testimonials of pilots from Macao who participated in the proof of motorcycles of the Macao Grand Prix," Carlos Barreto told HM. “We already have some material collected; there is still a lot of collection of collecting, compiling and writing the story, selecting the images, etc… We are in a hurry!”
The Macao Grand Prix today has only one motorcycle test on the program, the Macao de Motorcycle History, but it wasn't always like that. The event even had more than three motorcycle races, and even scooter races took place at the Citadino Circuito da MSA, always with a very strong presence of local pilots.</description><pubDate>2025-09-01 03:08:38</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Invitations for TCR Asia pilots who participate in Korea and Zhuzhou</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/27/gp-convites-para-pilotos-tcr-asia-que-participem-na-coreia-e-zhuzhou/</link><description>The 72nd Macao Grand Prix Race will again be the stage of the final test of Kumho Fia TCR World Tour, the largest tourist cars competition worldwide under the seal of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). The test will be equally open to the participation of competitors from other supplies
 
Being the last stage of the TCR worldwide competition season, the Macao race will bring together the fastest tour pilots in the world, also crowning the absolute champion of the TCR World Tour. The unique format of the competition promoted by WSC Group will allow local and regional riders of TCR to face international stars, creating an unforgettable show on the streets of the territory.
Prior to the final in Macao, the resurrected TCR Asia Series will share the track with the TCR World Tour from October 17-19, at the Inje, South Korea circuit, and from October 31 to November 2 at the Zhuzhou International Circuit in China. Participation in this race will be mandatory for riders who wish to obtain an invitation to the Guide Circuit event, also providing an opportunity for Macao riders, who did not qualify in other competitions, ensure a place at the big holiday party.
"In 2025, Wildcard registrations will be available to competitors who participated in TCR Asia events. To be eligible to sign up for Macao, competitors will be able to participate in the next races in South Korea and China, where TCR Asia will also share the grid with TCR World Tour," wrote TCR Asia Series on social networks, stressing that: “It's a unique opportunity for life: measuring forces with the best in the world in one of the most legendary strokes of motorized sport.”
On the subject, WSC Group president Marcello Lotti, the father of the TCR concept, added: “We are proud that TCR Asia added two events in conjunction with Kumho Fia tcr world tour. WSC is pleased to confirm that we will assign 'Wildcards' to competitors who want to join us in the final of the season in Macau.”
O TCR Asia Series tem competido com pneus da marca chinesa Sailun, mas nesta prova os pilotos terão de se adaptar aos compostos Kumho, obrigatórios na competição sancionada pela FIA. Sean Chang Chien Shang, piloto de Taiwan, lidera a classificação com quatro pontos de vantagem sobre o chinês Liu Zhi Chen, ambos ao volante de Audi RS 3 LMS.
GUARANTEED QUALITY
TCR Asia Series will not be the only competition to compose the FIA ​​TCR World Tour subscribers list at the MSA, as the 2025 season of TCR Australia will end in style when joining the Macao's 72nd guide race grid, which will take place from 13 to 16 November. TCR Australia's first international participation was possible thanks to the Global Championship rights holder, the WSC Group, which will ensure the full coverage of transportation costs to Australian teams traveling to Macao.
TCR Australia announced in June that it will focus on the proprietary of the competition at the event “The Bend 500”, from 12 to 14 September, in conjunction with the Australian round of Kumho Fia TCR World Tour, a competition with more than a dozen-time competitors. The Australian competition, which once had starting grids with about two dozen cars, will no longer run this year, beyond this and that scheduled for the Macao Grand Prix.
Also with evidence for playing in Australia, South Korea, China and Macau, the title champion of Kumho Fia World Tour, Yann Ehrlacher of Lynk &amp; Co, leads the 250 points, followed by Esteban Guerrieri, the wheel of a Honda, with 223, while Santiago Urrutia, also to the command of a Lynk &amp; Co, occupies a Lynk &amp; Co.

This represents the first title of the rider of the rider in competitions of Grand Tourism (GT) and the first title of a championship achieved in the service of SJM Theodore Racing.
Despite being sick and with two races for competing in the calendar of the competition organized by the prestigious Italian car brand, Charles Leong and the young Irish Alex Denning were always extremely fast on the Malaysian track. They won the first weekend race, thus reaching the sixth triumph of the season, and finished second in the second race. This second place raised to 10 the number of podiums obtained in 10 races, extending the impressive team series, which never ended below second place.
With two races still playing in the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals in Misano, Italy, in November, SJM Theodore Racing could focus on maintaining this impressive podium sequence, with the main objective of the season achieved. Charles Leong and Alex Denning are tied at the top of the pilot standings and are expected to complete the season side by side, sharing the same Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2.
Always adding
For Charles Leong, this result is the result of “incredible work on the team. We won the championship thanks to a great collective effort, without great errors and total consistency. For the race, I expected more group, but it was hard to fight my opponents with new tires. In the end, followed my rhythm and managed the tires to deliver the best car to Alex.
After finishing in second place in the classification of this same monomoccotes, the Macao pilot adds this title to those who won at an early age in the Renault Formula Asian Championship and the China Formula 4 Championship, in addition to the two remarkable victories in the Macao Formula 4 Macao Grand Prix.
Obviously pleased with the results obtained by his pupils, Teddy Yip Jr., owner of SJM Theodore Racing, commented: “I want to congratulate the whole team for this done, the result of a collective effort over the season and previous years. Pilots responded exemplary to pressure. Thanks to Charles, even sick, and Alex, who held another fast and consistent stint, guaranteeing the tenth, the tenth ‘Top-2’ in ten races. ”
Theodore Racing and SJM have been supporting Charles Leong since 2021, when they won their second triumph in Formula 4 on the guide circuit. In 2023, it ended very close to the Arvid Lindblad teammate in the Macao Grand Prix Race 4, completing a triumphant 1-2 from SJM Theodore Prema Racing. Absent from last year's edition due to commitments at Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia in Spain, Charles Leong has not announced whether he will participate in this year's Macao Grand Prix edition.</description><pubDate>2025-09-09 00:01:15</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Michael Rutter fails this year's edition</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/08/gp-macau-michael-rutter-falha-edicao-deste-ano/</link><description>Nine times winner of the Macau Grand Prix, Michael Rutter, will fail the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix. The charismatic British pilot continues to recover from the serious accident suffered at Isle of Man TT last June and is not fit to fight for tenth victory
 
In early summer, in the great classic of road, Michael Rutter fell off the motorcycle on the last lap of the Suartwin race, in the place known as 31st Milestone, and suffered several fractures in the spine, between the L2 and L5 vertebrae, even being transferred by helicopter to the hospital. The 53 -year -old pilot was also diagnosed with an ankle fracture.
After nearly three months away from the competition, “The Blade”, as he is known in the middle, made his return to motorcycling last August, participating in the famous classic TT parade, on top of a Honda RVF750 RC45, integrated in a tribute to the 1980s and 1990s. Of his nine wins in 1998, he went back to a motorcycle for the first time in the Classic TT, where he led a Honda RC45 in the 1980s and 1990s parade. However, Rutter is not yet prepared to return to the competition, the Irish publication News Letter said in the past week.
His last victory was achieved at the Guide Circuit in 2019, although not the way Rutter would like to have increased his palm, as the result was decided on the basis of positions after just one lap, after two red flag interruptions that led to the definitive cancellation of the race. Still with ambition to win a tenth time at the Macao Motorcycle Prize last year, deeply affected by bad weather, Rutter was disappointed with the result, having qualified with the fourth best time, in a race in which the result of the qualification determined the final positions of the race.
Before the accident at Isle of Man TT, Rutter had told News Letter that he wanted to travel to Macau at the end of the year. "We'll try again because it's another race that I really like to go. It's completely unique, it's on the other side of the world, one time zone, so it's unique," he said without knowing what he expected.
Another big question
Rutter may not be the only "historical" of the Macao Motorcycle Prize to be left out of this year's edition, as many doubts around Peter Hickman, he also victims of an accident at the Event of the Island of Man. The British accident was caused by a mechanical failure: the setting of the exhaust departed, causing it to come into contact with the rear tire and caused a hole that led to the fall of the experienced. Pilot. The winner of four editions suffered severe injuries: collarbone and left -blavado fracture, three broken ribs, four fractured vertebrae and still facial injuries.
In a social media publication, Hickman said he has worked “very hard” behind the scenes and even recently performed a test on Cadwell Park. Three months after the accident, he returned this weekend to the popular British Superbike Championship in Donington Park. The 38 -year -old has not yet recovered his best and the requirement of a city circuit, such as Macao, is far superior to a conventional circuit. So in the coming weeks it will be known if Hickman will try to conquer his fifth victory on the streets of Macau in 2025.
The 72nd Macau Grand Prix will take place between November 13 and 16 this year. In addition to the 57th Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, the program also features the Macao Grand Prix -FR's FR's World Cup, the FIA ​​GT GT Cup, the Macao Guide Race -Kumho Fia TCR World Tour of Macau, the Macao Formula 4 -FIA Formula 4 Cup (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge.</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 02:43:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Philippines | Carlos Barreto takes the experience of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/20/filipinas-carlos-barreto-leva-a-experiencia-de-macau/</link><description>Carlos Barreto, former racing director of the Macao de Motorcycle Grand Prix, is still active in the motorized sports of the Asian continent, more precisely in the Philippines, where he has been putting into practice the experience of more than three decades in the service of Macau Automobile and Motorcycle
 
“I was invited in 2024 to help develop National Track Motorcycle Championships-Underbone, Scooters and Superbikes-organized by Morac and Fetap,” Macau's former Macau-China General Association (AAMC) told HM. “The experience gained over three dozen years helps. I have done several motorcycle and karting championships on temporary circuits, mud and nape, then in the coloane karting, trials with local riders (motorcycles and karts) and international (karts). several motorcycle championships. ”
With a strong connection to the Macao Grand Prix, Carlos Barreto was a test director in the Karting and Motorcycle Championships between 1991 and 1996, and later, between 2004 and 2008. He was also president of the College of Sports Commissioners between 2009 and 2010. This vast experience allows him today to face this new reality in a different country, but always showed great passion for motorized sports, ease of “some aspects. that deserved more attention to the level of the tests. ” Among them, it highlights “sports regulations, the application of the rules, the dissemination of official documentation, some infrastructure equipment, as well as the structure and functional organization of the team that generates these championships, from the secretariat to track commissioners and proof direction”.
This collaboration began in November last year and, by 2024, already extended to three rounds of the championships. The contribution of Portuguese, born in Mozambique, has been significant: “The various suggestions I presented to each of the two circuits I know, the Clark International Speedway and the Racing Circuit Batangas, some have already been implemented and the rest will be resolved by the end of the year.
The competition itself is also growing: “The pandemia, in a way, delayed the development of these championships, but the number of pilots has been increasing, there are teams with financial capacity and good equipment. Clark tests sometimes come together to gather close to 80 pilots, while Batangas have about 60. The prospects are encouraging.”
Contribution to Karting
The Philippines is a country with a long tradition in Karting, dating back to the 1960s and the enthusiasm generated by Arsenio “Dodjie” Laurel, a pilot who lost his life on the Guide Circuit in 1967. The presence of Philippine Teams and Pilots in the Asian continent is common and, internally, the discipline has always followed what has been done worldwide.
“At the Karting level, national tests have a local and functional structure - for years it was Akoc,” recalls Carlos Barreto, adding: “My collaboration has been a sports commissioner at two international events in the Philippines. I did one in 2024 and another recently, the Fifth Rok Cup Asia Philippines, organized by Kilton Motors Corporation (KMC) and performed in Clark. ”
Also there, the former director of the Macao International Kart Prize (2004-2016), the 46th SKF World Championship of CIK-Sfi (2009) and the 49th Cik-Cia World Championship (2012), had the task of “auscultation of people and answering the questions that put me, as well as having suggestions for improvement”.
As for the future, Carlos Barreto believes that “the seed is launched, and now it remains to be expected to grow and that the results will become visible in the medium term.”
Macao a step ahead
For the author of the book “History of Karting in Macao”, written in co -authorship with Pedro Dá Mesquita, the MSar remains a step forward with the sports organization of this nature. “Macau has a clear advantage, but it must be borne in mind that events in Macao have the precious support of government entities, while in the Philippines it is an organization without these supports,” says Carlos Barreto.
Still, the evidence in the Philippines, a country with a vast history in the motorized Southeast Asia sport, are nothing to do with what is done in the territory in terms of competitiveness. "At the event level, scooter races are often very excited and competitive, with six to eight riders fighting every lap in the first place, numerous overtaking and suspense until cutting the goal.

For the first time since 2015, F1 will receive a 11th team on the starting grid next season, with Cadillac's entry, putting an end to a three-year wait since the US team presented its candidacy following the FIA ​​appeal for demonstrations of interest. As there will be a margin for a 12th team, Ben Suulayem is willing to launch a new process of manifestation of interest, making it clear that an application from China would be welcome.
The entry of a Chinese team would be aligned with F1's strategic efforts to expand its presence in key markets. China's Grand Prix has recently renewed its contract by 2030, consolidating the country's role in the long -term view of the sport.
"We have a 11th team [Cadillac]. I believe we should analyze the performance of this 11th team and then if there is a Chinese [candidacy]-and I will now speak on behalf of FOM [Formula One Management]-they will approve it, because it is about supporting the business," said the FIA ​​president in a joint interview with several journalists from the automobile sector.
Ben Suulayem made it clear that there is no urgent need to have a 12th team. However, given F1's upward trajectory in recent years, the addition of another team to the starting grid, especially one from China, would further increase the call of the sport in the largest business market on the planet. "If there is a team from China, let's say, and the first to approve - and I'm 100% sure that it will approve it - would no longer make money with China's entry? I believe yes," he said.
A huge market for exploring
The Chinese automotive market is incomparable, producing more than 30 million vehicles a year - more than the United States of America, Japan and India together. In addition, China has contributed to the increase in the fan base in sports, with over 150 million fans and more than 1 million new followers on Chinese social networks, increasing the total to 4.3 million. F1 fan segmentation analysis itself has revealed that more than half of fans in the country have started following the sport in the last four years. Interestingly, the audience is younger than the average F1 supporters and more diverse, with a 50% female demography.
For Ben Sulayem, it is more than just increasing the number of teams: it is to unite the main global markets under the F1 flag, because the number of Chinese sponsors and partners in the “Queen Class” of motor sport is currently limited, boiling down to the official Aston Martin Content Creation Partner, and Sauber's Sensetime. The presence of the Chinese brand Yili, which in the meantime came out, and the Sensetime in the Sauber universe was undoubtedly linked to the fact that Zhou Guanyu, the first full -time Chinese driver at F1, running the Swiss team at the time the agreements were signed.

Geely in pole-position
O sonho de uma equipa chinesa pode ainda estar numa fase embrionária, mas com o apoio do presidente da FIA e o crescente foco da modalidade na China, a visão de uma marca chinesa nas grelhas de partida da F1 poderá estar cada vez mais próxima da realidade. Uma marca chinesa como a Geely poderia encaixar naturalmente na F1, tendo em conta a sua presença global e o facto de deter marcas internacionais reputadas como a Volvo ou a Lotus, participações como acionista na Aston Martin e no Mercedes-Benz Group, e joint ventures com a Renault.
Vale também a pena referir que, recentemente, a Lotus Cars, propriedade da Geely, recuperou o nome Team Lotus, reunindo os seus programas de competição com apoio oficial, equipas parceiras, campeonatos Lotus Cup e programas de desenvolvimento de pilotos. Segundo a empresa, o renascimento do Team Lotus “significa o nosso compromisso com a competição global e a cultura do desporto motorizado”. For now, this is limited to GT cars, but one cannot help but imagine where it may evolve in the future.
Lotus Group has been the property of Geely since 2017. Team Lotus team was a constant presence in Formula 1 between 1954 and 1994, and there were some attempts to reactivate the name linked to their historic past in F1, attempts that ended just over nine years ago. In addition to the Lotus Sports Program and others of regional or national work, Geely is also present in Auto Sport with Lynk &amp; Co, at FIA TCR World Tour, and through its partnership with Renault, as a engine supplier, in the Chinese F4 Championship.</description><pubDate>2025-08-15 16:34:43</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
