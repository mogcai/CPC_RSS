According to information released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC, central bank) on its official website, the official exchange rate for yesterday was set at 7.0733 yuan per dollar, 164 'pips' (one hundredth of 1 percent, a measure used in exchange rate analyses) below the most widespread forecasts among investors and analysts.
The decision, highlights the Bloomberg agency, represents the biggest difference between market expectations and the rate finally fixed by the BPC since February 2022. The exchange rate fixed by the BPC is fundamental for the quotation of the “onshore” rate — negotiated in national markets — of the yuan, since it can only deviate within a maximum daily range of 2 percent, both when it appreciates and when it depreciates.
Given the optimism that followed the trade truce between China and the United States, followed by the announcement of the possible visit of US President Donald Trump to the Asian country next year, the yuan has been approaching the psychological barrier of 7 units per dollar, and its value in the markets is on track to reach the highest levels since 2020.
Part of the appreciation of the yuan in relation to the dollar is also due to fears, reflected in the US currency, regarding the budgetary policy of the United States, as well as forecasts of a reduction in interest rates by the Federal Reserve (Fed).
"The PBOC has been prioritizing exchange rate stability, so it is not surprising (…) that they are slowing down the pace of increases. We do not expect the level of 7 units [per dollar] to be put to the test for the rest of the year, but it will probably be surpassed at some point next year", said Lynn Song, ING's chief economist for China, cited by Bloomberg.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:57:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Taxis | Request more services per application</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/taxis-pedidos-mais-servicos-por-aplicacao/</link><description>The Association of Automobile Traders and Workers of Macau considers that Macau should have mobile phone applications to hail taxis similar to Didi or Uber, calling on the Government to bring this service to the territory when launching the public consultation to review the regulations on passenger transport in Taxis.

In “Meet You There”, opened today at the AMAGAO gallery, Marreiros joins his friend Nyoman Suarnata for an exhibition that reflects “territories of adjustable perception”, with concepts shaped by “collaboration, dialogue and imagination”
The AMAGAO gallery, a project by Lina Ramadas and Vítor Hugo Marreiros, hosts a new exhibition today. “Meet You There” begins to receive its first visitors at 6:30 pm, featuring works by two artists who decided to join forces: Alexandre Marreiros, who usually wanders between arts and architecture, and Nyoman Suarnata.
In the curatorial text about this exhibition, it is stated that “Meet You There” is not just “a point on the map”, but rather “a conceptual territory shaped by collaboration, dialogue and imagination”, where the two artists “transform canvas and paper into a shared space where perception is fluid and the narrative pulses like a living organism”.
This “creative encounter” brings a new “place where visual language becomes an instrument of investigation”, with works with “overlapping compositions, fragmented symbols and constantly shifting perspectives”, where “artists build a territory that resists fixed meaning”.
And what elements live in this new territory full of concepts and conceptions? “Social, personal and environmental concerns”, which then “metamorphose into characters, symbols and even superheroes”. "These are not figures that save, but that reveal. They are incarnations of urgency, empathy and resistance, challenging the viewer to reflect: what does it mean to care? Imagine? Act?", the same text asks.
This exhibition invites you “to participate in a space where art is not static, but generative; where dialogue is not linear, but stratified; and where imagination is a form of engagement and participation”.
Studio work
Speaking to HM about the exhibition, Alexandre Marreiros talks about an exhibition created by two friends, with much of the work carried out in Macau, together, in a permanent collaboration. This was due to “several trips that Nyoman made to Macau, namely to my studio, where he was free to choose any of my works”.
"There was always an interesting construction, a long process, first for Nyoman to free himself and choose a work of mine without limitations. After a day of work I responded to his interventions. At first it was a curious thing, because he had great respect and almost didn't touch the parts he had already painted and I didn't touch his things either, but we felt that there was a kind of limit, something we didn't want. There was a very interesting exercise in liberation, in which I opened the doors of my studio, I gave him the works that He had to be able to choose and intervene in them, and then I would respond.”
Thus, 34 works emerged in around two years of joint work, in which the artistic skills of both came into contact. "If we look back, we see that I always have a graphic resource and also the word in my works. Nyoman also has that register, something perhaps more handwritten, and I had other techniques, be it screen printing, lithography or drawing, I used them a lot to transport the word to my works."
Alexandre Marreiros assumes that “in some way, there is always a character” in his works, namely “poets and philosophers”, more specifically “there is always a predominant character in my work, which is Luís de Camões”; while Nyoman “has a universe of characters that can be assimilated, or not, in a critical way, or that can be considered superheroes or a human being with supernatural powers”.
“Meet You There” is, therefore, the result of a permanent collaboration, in which one artist worked on the other’s works in their absence, in which there were “few opportunities, perhaps 10 or 20 percent, in which we could both participate directly in the work”.
“It's something you feel in the work, which is honest, in the sense that there is a universe of communion, universality and trust, of two very different people who meet, respect and admire each other”, said Marreiros.
Contemporary themes
In these works there is satire “of the times in which we live”, namely “in a series of works, the first, and which are very much the representation of what Nyoman sees in Macau”. There is then another series “with his superheroes and mine, which are always the writers, philosophers and human beings who, in some way, left their mark on this passage that is life”.
There are also other works “a little more linked to Macau, namely to the world of casinos”. “I actively and directly participate in this Macau identity and industry and, therefore, it is natural that this universe appears in my work and there are interventions and reinterpretations by Nyoman.”
Macau has always been, for the two artists, “a meeting and work point”, with this project being “a liberation” for Alexandre Marreiros, in the sense that he opened the door of his studio to Nyoman's interventions.
It is “an exhibition that talks about globalization, relationships of trust, cultural, artistic and intellectual differences that can coexist in the same territory”. There are satirical messages “that reveal some concerns of the two artists in the context in which they live and in the context in which they operate globally”. “Meet You There” is, for Alexandre Marreiros, “an exposure of our time and context, and revealing that differences can coexist and create beautiful dialogues and narratives, which are also different”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:45:10</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Unanimity regarding “Super Pole” in GT</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/gp-unanimidade-quanto-a-super-pole-nos-gt/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) should continue to focus on the “Super Pole” system for the ninth FIA GT World Cup, if this race is once again included in the program of the 73rd Macau Grand Prix next year
For the first time, in last November's edition, the ten fastest in Qualifying 1 had 20 minutes to prepare for the first “Super Pole” in the history of the FIA ​​GT World Cup, in which, in reverse order of times, each driver entered the track alone for one out lap, two timed laps and one return lap, with one-minute intervals between competitors and the possibility of using a new set of tires. The best time obtained between the two timed laps determined Qualification 2 “Super Pole”, which defined the starting grid for the Classified Race.
Following the success of this initiative, the international federation intends to continue applying it in the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup, having even produced a promotional video to confirm this. Lutz Leif Linden, President of the GT Commission and the FIA ​​Constructors' Commission, admits that this is something “very exciting for the spectators as well as the drivers”.
Present in Macau during the Grand Prix, the influential Stéphane Ratel, CEO of SRO Motorsports Group, co-organizer of the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup, also agrees with the measure, highlighting that it represents "an additional challenge and one that works. At SRO we do this on a global level. In the biggest events, like the 24 Hours of Spa, we have a 'Super Pole', and it is something we like."
Riders and brands agree
Drivers and brands were equally impressed with this first experience on the territory's streets. “Macau is already special and I think that, with this format, we had something even more special”, recalled Antonio Fuoco, the driver who gave Ferrari its first in Macau since 1995.
Ferdinando Cannizzo, head of Ferrari's Competizioni GT, reinforces the idea, highlighting the technical advantage when the challenge comes down to the driver and the circuit, without external interference. “Without cars, without traffic, you can really focus on your strengths and try to maximize the car’s performance”, said the Cavallino Rampante brand representative.
This qualification system, an important moment of the weekend given the difficulty of overtaking on the Guia Circuit, also adds an element of uncertainty and elevates the spectacle. Stefan Gugger, responsible for the development of Lamborghini's competition cars, said that, in his opinion, "it's an improvement for our fans. We can really see the performance of the driver and the car, which also represents a good challenge for the team."
Porsche, one of the brands that most advocated the mandatory introduction of expensive torque sensors in this race, was also one of the main drivers of the “Super Pole”. “I believe the new format is a real step forward,” said Thomas Laudenbach, Vice President of Porsche Motorsport. "It allows the drivers to have clean laps. It's a great step in the right direction, maybe with some tuning, but overall for me it's positive. I hope they maintain this format because it's fantastic."
Meanwhile, the date of the 2026 edition of the Macau Grand Prix is ​​expected to be confirmed next week, during the FIA ​​World Council, which will take place before the FIA ​​awards ceremony for 2025, in the city of Tashkent, Uzbekistan.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:52:45</pubDate></item><item><title>IAM | Dogs appear dead again in Coloane</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/iam-caes-voltam-a-aparecer-mortos-em-coloane/</link><description>An internet user shared photographs of three dead dogs on Facebook and reported the presence of IAM employees carelessly spreading rat poison. The IAM says that autopsies revealed systemic hemorrhagic lesions and that death from poisoning is “extremely low”. The case was referred to the police
It happened again. On Wednesday, photographs of dead dogs were published on Facebook. The author, who suspected death by poisoning, says he saw employees from the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) and a company hired by the public entity spreading rat poison in an area, in Coloane, where a dead dog was found.
According to the publication, the internet user approached IAM and cleaning company employees criticizing the method of applying the poison in violation of established guidelines, which would be exposed on the side of the road, within reach of people and domestic animals. In response, the complainant states that he was told that everything was fine, and they continued to deposit the poison despite the citizen's protests.
On Wednesday night, the IAM issued a statement addressing the issue, stating that it had received “successive reports from citizens about the discovery of three dog corpses in three adjacent locations in Coloane”, starting last Saturday. Stating that it is “highly attentive to the incident”, the IAM indicates that it immediately deployed personnel to monitor the cases in the locations in question. "After the autopsy of the corpses and respective analysis, it was found that the three dogs in question had systemic hemorrhagic lesions. The Institute has already reported the case to the police, awaiting further investigation."
Carbon paper
Regarding the suspicion of poison ingestion by dogs, the IAM highlighted that the product currently used “contains a bitter agent, specifically designed for rats due to their lack of vomiting reflex”. "For animals with a vomiting system, including cats and dogs, accidental ingestion causes a vomiting reaction, making swallowing difficult. Therefore, the probability of poisoning through accidental ingestion is extremely low. Furthermore, the dose of bait placed by IAM workers each time is specifically calculated for the small size of rats," added the public entity.
In the Facebook post, the internet user published a photograph where you can see a pile of reddish colored sprinkles.
The institute led by Chao Wai Ieng also indicated that the poison is placed in fixed and locked boxes, or in rat holes, remaining hidden and without easy contact by people or animals. A statement completely contradictory to the report of the internet user who reported the situation.
At the beginning of May, a similar case also occurred in Taipa with three dead dogs and similar suspicions. At the time, the IAM issued a statement similar to the one released on Wednesday night.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:22:16</pubDate></item><item><title>HIV | Association warns of increasing trends</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/vih-associacao-alerta-para-tendencias-de-aumento/</link><description>Kelvin Lei, project supervisor at the Macao AIDS Care Association, warns of the complexity of the greater number of HIV cases in the non-resident population and regrets that the stigma surrounding the virus and the disease is still a reality in the territory
The Macao AIDS Care Association speaks of a scenario of complexity given the growing number of new HIV cases among non-residents. In an interview with HM, Kelvin Lei, the association's project supervisor, describes that “the trend observed among non-residents is complex and reflects structural factors, and not just individual behavior”.
These factors are “Macau’s status as an international hub, which means a constant flow of people, including visitors, immigrant workers and students from around the world”, who “may have different attitudes towards high-risk sexual behavior due to their cultural diversity and academic background”.
For Kelvin Lei, “greater attention to testing and detecting cases among non-residents can lead to more diagnoses”, and “barriers [in access] to services” persist, particularly due to “linguistic differences, limited knowledge of local health rights, concerns about confidentiality or work schedules that conflict with opening hours”.
“The fear of stigma or job loss” still remains, scenarios that can be “a significant impediment to seeking tests or health care”. There are also “socio-economic factors” that explain the growth in cases. Data from the Health Services in November speak of a growing trend in cases: between January and September this year, 28 new cases of HIV infection were registered, 14 of which were among residents and 14 among non-residents. Last year, there was no reference to non-residents being infected.
In comparison, between January and September last year, nine cases had been confirmed among residents, meaning that throughout this year there has been a 55.6 percent increase in new cases detected.
Important role
The conversation with Kelvin Lei arose regarding the holding, this weekend, of the 8th Forum on AIDS in Beijing, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, taking place in Lisbon Macau, in Cotai. In 2016, Macau had organized another edition of this event.
For Kelvin Lei, the repetition of Macau as a host location “has a profound meaning” for the association, as it “reaffirms the active and committed role” of the territory “as a vital bridge in the regional partnership between Beijing, Hong Kong and Taiwan in the fight against HIV/AIDS”.
“Although Macau’s prevalence [of new cases] remains relatively low, we face distinct challenges, including a mobile population and the need for sustained and targeted prevention,” he said.
“The misconception that HIV only affects specific groups, such as men who have sex with men, as is the case globally” also persists in the territory. This is a “harmful idea, because it creates a false sense of security in other populations and worsens stigma”.
Focus on the individual
Regarding stigma, Kelvin Lei draws attention to the fact that, “in compact communities like Macau and Hong Kong”, there is “a fear of social disclosure within close-knit networks”. It is up to the Executive to incorporate another type of discourse into its policies, he suggested.
"We recognize and appreciate the SAR Government's commitment and resource allocation to prevention and treatment, with the clinical infrastructure providing essential antiretroviral therapy. The doctor-patient ratio in this specific area is managed. The discourse has progressively shifted towards a scientific and public health framework. However, the next frontier is to truly integrate the fight against stigma into official discourse and systemic practice."
The supervisor speaks of the need for public defense of the “U=U” concept, that is, “undetectable – non-transmissible”, in addition to the need to “promote person-centered care that looks at the individual, and not just the virus”. Kelvin Lei also advises “promoting the standardization of tests for everyone and guaranteeing non-discriminatory policies in all contexts”.
Therefore, holding the Forum this weekend brings a dialogue “with representatives from all regions, including the Government, which is a positive step towards aligning our scientific capabilities, with the necessary social support, to end the epidemic”.
It is also intended to analyze “innovative strategies, such as long-term prevention and artificial intelligence applications that we are discussing, and a spirit of solidarity”.
The AIDS Care Association in Macau sees itself as “one of the main associations in HIV prevention in Macau”, facing “non-medical challenges”, such as “internalized and social stigma”, which “can lead to profound loneliness and mental health problems”. It is also necessary to “guarantee continuity of care”, with “holistic needs” on the part of patients, such as medication, “psychological counseling, support to reveal the condition to family or employers and, sometimes, nutritional or financial assistance”. This association therefore provides a series of support in this regard.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:20:56</pubDate></item><item><title>APAVT | Macau is international “Preferred Destination” in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/apavt-macau-e-destino-preferido-internacional-em-2026/</link><description>The Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies once again chose Macau as the association's Preferred Destination in 2026, which will allow for reinforced cooperation. Helena de Senna Fernandes praised the continuation of the good work resulting from the partnership with the Portuguese association
"Macau and the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT) decided that they should not stop. That is why I convey to you with great joy that we have decided, Macau and APAVT, that Macau will be APAVT's preferred international destination throughout 2026", stated the president of APAVT, Pedro Costa Ferreira in the territory.
The 50th APAVT National Congress, which has been taking place since Tuesday in Macau, ended yesterday, and was attended by more than a thousand professionals, a record number, to debate the future of the tourism sector. Macau hosted for the sixth time what is considered the largest congress in the Portuguese tourism sector.
"I can't be happier. You know my status in my last term. I'm fulfilling a dream, which is to return to Macau and work with Macau again. (…) The Congress has been, in my opinion, memorable from the point of view of the themes, but it has also been memorable from the point of view of the number, it is the biggest ever, and it has been memorable from the point of view of reception capacity", reinforced Pedro Costa Ferreira.
APAVT's Preferred Destination is a “very broad” program, which has two fundamental parts, communication and marketing, and which, in this way, helps the chosen destination to promote itself. “It means that in all our presences, we will have Macau with us and, therefore, we have this communication”, added the president of the association, remembering that in this way a relationship that has existed for many years is reinforced.
Old friends
“The return of Congress to our city this year and the designation of Macau, along with China, as a Preferred Destination for 2026, paves the way for us to continue working well”, said the director of Tourism Services, Helena de Senna Fernandes.
The main new feature of Destino Preferido in 2026 will be the launch of an 'e-learning' program about Macau for travel agents from Germany, Finland and the Netherlands, just like the program that was launched in Portugal in 2024. The 'e-learning' will be developed by APAVT and Macau Tourism, in collaboration with the European Confederation of Associations of Travel Agencies and Tour Operators (European Confederation of Travel Agents’ and Tour Operators’ Associations [ECTAA]).
Pedro Costa Ferreira also recalled that this congress has several “special meanings”, firstly “because it is the sixth” in Macau and because it was chosen “to conclude the celebration of the 75th anniversary” of the association. APAVT says it has accredited 1,039 congressmen from 172 different flights, congressmen who “will now visit several provinces in China in collaboration with Macau Tourism”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:17:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Work | Two-thirds rest only 1 or 1.5 days a week</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/trabalho-dois-tercos-descansam-apenas-1-ou-15-dias-por-semana/</link><description>A FAOM survey revealed that around 60 percent of workers did not receive a salary update this year and two thirds did not have a two-day weekly rest. Leong Sun Iok wants the Government to give clear guidance to companies to prioritize hiring residents and set a minimum quota for locals
Frozen wages, work overload, financial insecurity and unfair competition with very low wages from non-residents were the main concerns revealed by around 2,000 workers who responded to a survey on working conditions in 2025. The work, presented yesterday, was carried out by the Macau Workers' Associations (FAOM).
For 60 percent of those interviewed, there were no salary increases this year, while 10 percent even had salary cuts. Furthermore, close to two-thirds of workers complained of an excessive workload, with their weekly rest period reduced to one day or one and a half days.
Another situation that disrupts the balance between life and work is technological access that allows work tasks to be transferred to free time and home. This situation once again became the target of complaints from workers, leading FAOM officials to ask the Government to clearly define the parameters of the “right to be offline”. To achieve this, workers must be entitled to overtime compensation, or shift work wages.
In addition to these problems, there were frequent reports of a lack of stability and financial “cushion”, causing feelings of insecurity regarding the future.
The bogeyman
Echoing one of FAOM's political slogans, interviewees consider that labor policies do not effectively prioritize local people in access to employment. As such, 63 percent of respondents revealed a lack of clarity in the protection measures for resident workers.
At this point, deputy Leong Sun Iok, stated that “although current laws already define the priority of local residents, the Government has never outlined clear requirements for companies in relation to human resources hiring practices”. The result is a lack of effectiveness in achieving the priority.
One solution, pointed out by the deputy, would be the firm application of quotas or minimum proportion of residents in the human resources of each company, as happens with management positions in gaming concessionaires. Leong Sun Iok believes that in this way, employers would be “incentivized” to train local employees.
The excessively low wages of non-resident workers, and the resulting unfair competition caused by the salary gap, was highlighted by 60 percent of respondents. Leong Sun Iok argues that the Government should refuse requests to hire non-residents when the salaries proposed by employers are too low.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:12:12</pubDate></item><item><title>China | Yuan below expectations after reaching highs against the dollar</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/china-yuan-abaixo-do-esperado-apos-atingir-maximos-face-ao-dolar/</link><description>China's central bank yesterday set its reference exchange rate for the yuan below what markets expected, in a sign that Beijing is seeking to halt the currency's recovery against the dollar.

At first it was a curious thing, because he had great respect and almost didn't touch the parts he had already painted and I didn't touch his things either, but we felt that there was a kind of limit, something we didn't want. There was a very interesting exercise in liberation, in which I opened the doors of my studio, I gave him the works that He had to be able to choose and intervene in them, and then I would respond.”
Thus, 34 works emerged in around two years of joint work, in which the artistic skills of both came into contact. "If we look back, we see that I always have a graphic resource and also the word in my works. Nyoman also has that register, something perhaps more handwritten, and I had other techniques, be it screen printing, lithography or drawing, I used them a lot to transport the word to my works."
Alexandre Marreiros assumes that “in some way, there is always a character” in his works, namely “poets and philosophers”, more specifically “there is always a predominant character in my work, which is Luís de Camões”; while Nyoman “has a universe of characters that can be assimilated, or not, in a critical way, or that can be considered superheroes or a human being with supernatural powers”.
“Meet You There” is, therefore, the result of a permanent collaboration, in which one artist worked on the other’s works in their absence, in which there were “few opportunities, perhaps 10 or 20 percent, in which we could both participate directly in the work”.
“It's something you feel in the work, which is honest, in the sense that there is a universe of communion, universality and trust, of two very different people who meet, respect and admire each other”, said Marreiros.
Contemporary themes
In these works there is satire “of the times in which we live”, namely “in a series of works, the first, and which are very much the representation of what Nyoman sees in Macau”. There is then another series “with his superheroes and mine, which are always the writers, philosophers and human beings who, in some way, left their mark on this passage that is life”.
There are also other works “a little more linked to Macau, namely to the world of casinos”. “I actively and directly participate in this Macau identity and industry and, therefore, it is natural that this universe appears in my work and there are interventions and reinterpretations by Nyoman.”
Macau has always been, for the two artists, “a meeting and work point”, with this project being “a liberation” for Alexandre Marreiros, in the sense that he opened the door of his studio to Nyoman's interventions.
It is “an exhibition that talks about globalization, relationships of trust, cultural, artistic and intellectual differences that can coexist in the same territory”. There are satirical messages “that reveal some concerns of the two artists in the context in which they live and in the context in which they operate globally”. “Meet You There” is, for Alexandre Marreiros, “an exposure of our time and context, and revealing that differences can coexist and create beautiful dialogues and narratives, which are also different”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:45:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Festival of short films and animations to see in the Capitol</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/04/festival-de-curtas-e-animacoes-para-ver-no-capitolio/</link><description>Another edition of the Macau International Short Film Festival has been taking place since Tuesday, promoted by Creative Macau.

Japan's central bank governor, Kazuo Ueda, sparked speculation on Monday about a possible rate hike, when he suggested in a speech before business leaders that economic conditions are ripe for continuing with the normalization of monetary policy, which the organization suspended in January to assess the impact of new United States tariffs.
Without anticipating the outcome of the BoJ's next monetary policy meeting in the middle of this month, Ueda said that “appropriately adjusting the level of monetary easing, neither too late nor too early, is necessary to smoothly achieve the objective of price stability, while ensuring the stability of financial and capital markets.”
The words caused sharp falls on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and debt securities, which had already reached highs since the 2008 financial crisis due to concerns about the archipelago's fiscal health, soared.
They also happened after the announcement by the new Japanese Executive of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, last Thursday, of the project for the expected supplementary budget for 2025, valued at 18.3 billion yen (more than 100 billion euros), which will be financed largely with the issuance of State bonds, and intended above all for an ambitious stimulus package.
Central precautions
The BoJ is, by far, the largest investor in bonds of the most indebted country among the most advanced economies, whose yield is the barometer par excellence of long-term rates.
The central bank has kept benchmark interest rates at 0.5 percent for the past six monetary policy meetings, since a 25 basis point increase in January.
The last meeting of the year generated great expectations, after the change of government in Japan, in October, but the BoJ maintained a cautious stance, before knowing the financial position of the new prime minister – who was critical in relation to the rise in interest rates – and also taking a stabilized view on tariff negotiations with the United States, Japan's second largest trading partner, after China.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:51:19</pubDate></item><item><title>DSAT | Survey reveals that almost half of trips are made on foot</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/dsat-inquerito-releva-que-quase-metade-das-deslocacoes-se-fazem-a-pe/</link><description>A study carried out by the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT), relating to 2024, revealed that, among the different modes of travel, walking continues to record the highest proportion, with around 46.5 percent, similar to the 2019 record.

Adjectives such as «bizarre», «eccentric», «peculiar» but also «archaic» were attributed to his paintings. The latter, however, already points to a common desire among literate painters: if they were anachronistic they continued to correspond to the desire to make painting a vehicle to convey elevated feelings and fluid thoughts.
Cui Zizhong's figures sometimes seemed to express this effort. Looking at their disheveled clothes, some noticed how they looked like people who had just returned from sleepless nights of long conversations that didn't even allow time to rest. Other painters, in their works, followed these extravagant visions, proving that figurative meetings perhaps corresponded to authentic dialogues.
Such would be the case of a literary friend of Cui Zizhong who after the age of sixty dedicated himself solely to painting at court, at the Imperial Academy of Painting in Beijing, restored in the Ming dynasty, called Wang Chongjie (1605-1667). For the portrait that Wang Chongjie made in the summer of 1657 of the Suzhou painter, Wang Jian (1598-1677), which is in the Kaikodo Art Gallery, in Hawaii (horizontal scroll, ink and color on silk, 43.3 x174 cm), other important authors who participated in these dialogues contributed: Wang Wu (1632-90), according to a colophone, created the landscape around the subject, with a river where two ducks swim, and next to the painting, the celebrated painter Wu Weiye (1609-71), who lived through the dynastic transition with sorrow, wrote a poem.
Wang Chongjie, in making Wang Jian's portrait, would seem to be making a synthesis of the state of art in his time. Not only was he the grandson of the famous and venerated painter Wang Shizhen (1526-90), but the careful treatment of the shadows on his face may indicate the appropriation of a new way of doing things resulting from contact with European painters who were at the court at the end of the Ming.
In an album that shows literati next to watercourses (paint and color on silk, 25.5 x 31.3 cm, at the Angewandte kunst Museum in Frankfurt), when there are mountains they are only schematic. If, as Confucius said, mountains please the heart and flowing waters please thoughts, one can deduce that it was this flowing water that inspired them. And what were these dialogues about in the midst of pristine nature, Zhang Yanyuan in the 19th century. IX, writing about the edifying character of painting, said: «it is a means through which events are preserved, in such a way that they serve as models (for the virtuous) and warnings (for the wrong path)».</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Ana Cristina Alves</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>By Ana Cristina Alves, Assistant Researcher and Coordinator of the Educational Service of the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center1
The Taoist philosophy of the beginnings, that of Laozi and the Book of Way and Virtue (《道德经/經》), will choose the water of the ocean and the sea as the privileged image of the Tao (道 Dào), that which cannot be said, without form, on which the universe itself and the ten thousand beings (万物 wânwù) that inhabit it depend, as well as the first principles of existence, the void (無/无 wú), the masculine yang (陽/阳 yáng) and the feminine yin (阴/隂yīn).
This choice of an indigenous Chinese philosophy finds its echo in popular language and philosophy, for example in expressions such as “enormous capacity” (海量Hǎiliàng), which can have both an affective and social interpretation of portentous generosity or magnanimity, as well as a physical and concrete one, applying to someone who can ingest large quantities of alcohol. The sea is also linked to the word good and constant, for example in the “oath of eternal love as energetic as the sea and firm as the mountain”, where mountain lends added firmness to the promise (海誓山盟 or 山盟海誓Hǎishì-Shānméng or Shānméng-Hǎishì).
The ocean, the sea, but also the great rivers are made up of generous water, both in popular and erudite Taoist philosophy.  Here water is the figurative model of the Tao, as read in the Book of Way and Virtue and in the best sinology, which is why we recommend additional reading of Alan Watts Tao: The Watercourse Way.
It is worth paying special attention to the chapters in which water appears as the closest representation of the Tao in the Book of Way and Virtue, namely: chapters 8, 14, 34, 66 and 78.
In chapter 8 we are informed that the Tao is the supreme good “like water” (上善如水) (Abreu, 2014, 43), but it is not water itself. Therefore, it will be due to the similarity of functions that both are compared. Now water is generous, granting life to all beings, without establishing any distinction between them, its gift reaches even those that no one likes and I am thinking, for example, of parasites. It remains close to the earth to fertilize it, it is deep, simple, true, fair and correct and very timely, when it washes and cleans at the right time.
This is also the case with the Tao.  In the first verses of chapter XIV, regarding the Tao, an aquatic image appears again:
 
You look and you don't see,
It's called Indistinct.
You listen and you don't hear,
It's called Silent.
Touch and don't get caught,
It's called Subtle.
This trio is not decipherable
For it merges into a unity
2 (Ribeiro, 2004, 32-33)
And a little later we are told that he is nameless and uninterrupted (繩繩不可名) (Ibidem)
The Tao is like an ocean, an uninterrupted and inexhaustible unity in which someone easily imagines themselves swimming in water that is neither too bright nor too dark, as would happen to Michael Saso in his 14th meditation on the Tao, in A Taoist Cookbook. with Meditations from the Laozi DaodeJing, which he called “Nadar no Tao” (Saso, 1994,47), a meditation that he accompanied by a recipe for spinach, soy paste and sesame, since the wise man is the one who “empties the mind and fills the belly” (虛其心實其復) (Ribeiro, 2004, 10-11), here one feels how the author is immersed in the great Tao, following with the current.
Water can also be represented in a large river, as in chapter 34:
The great Tao floods like a river,
To the left, to the right,
Ten thousand beings depend on him.
（大道泛兮/其可左右/万物恃之而生）
(Abreu, 2013, 94-95)
In the same chapter we are told that the Tao not only gives life but nourishes and feeds, being an essential shelter in the return to the origins, not for death, but for eternal life diluted in the great unity, being therefore great, as big as the sea, or rather the great sea, which is the ocean.
Whoever wants to be as it should be in existence or even correctly govern the world, must follow the model of the water in rivers and seas, as we read in chapter 66:
Rivers and seas are greater than a hundred valleys
Because they remain below them,
and so they are princes, dominating waterfalls and streams.
(江海所以能为百谷王者/以其善下之/故能为百故王)3
(Abreu,2013, 158-159)
The wise man's behavior is distinguished by its malleability and spontaneity. He does not impose himself, which is why he is respected by everyone, only he should then govern, because he acts naturally, without oppressing, without hurting, letting everyone follow their course as freely as possible, as is reiterated in chapter 78:
Nothing in the world is more malleable and flexible
as for water,
but in attacking what is hard and rigid
nothing can surpass it
and there is nothing to replace it.
(天下莫柔弱於水/而攻堅強者莫之能先)
(Ribeiro, 2004 160-161)
Laozi's Taoist water is among the Five Chinese Elements (Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal) the one that evokes great oceanic unity, source of life for everything that exists, but also of death, or rather, of return to origins and eternal life, when this image represents the philosophical principle Tao. And if water, fresh and salty, is the supreme good of the world, the Tao is the origin, the supreme good, including of Heaven. As a root or mysterious female (chap 6) it is the root of the cosmos as we know and experience it. He is a source of spiritual and material life, but so is water, since his model must be followed in all circumstances, from the material source of beings to complex human conduct. People who act correctly, and especially Taoist sages and saints, are aware of the physical and concrete model of water that helps them practice another invisible one, that of Tao.  They will then be malleable and adaptable, capable of nourishing themselves from the inside and giving life to any form on the outside. You will know how to transform yourself to better nourish and vivify.
The Taoist oceanic model differs from the one that inspired the Portuguese throughout history, who looked to the sea as their ocean. Taoist water is not challenging nor does it call for conquest, it does not have cables of storm or hope to bend, it does not require weapons or boats, nor maps, nor nautical instruments. It is the dominant, conquering element within all beings, who will adapt to this most malleable element, without needing to develop their inventive spirit. The philosophy it leads to does not ask for vigilance or a critical spirit, but adaptation to the world as it is and generosity to accept it with a minimum of suffering and a maximum of joy.

Four years ago, in 2021, James inherited more than 300 pieces of antiques from his elderly father. The family heritage dates back to the Song dynasty (10th-13th centuries) and the collection includes exquisite jade items, porcelain, bronze wares, incense burners and high-value jewelry from various periods. During the turbulent war years, these treasures were buried in a hole in the backyard for decades. Now, through their interdisciplinary curatorial project, they are about to enter a dynamic dialogue with the worlds of fashion, art and sport.
Joy: Como se sentiu quando recebeu a herança familiar?
I was completely surprised! My brothers and I had no idea that our family had such things. We were ignorant about our family history.
Joy: Tell me about your family history.
James: Our original surname was Zhao and we belonged to the imperial family of the Song dynasty. Our roots are in the heart of Chinese civilization. A história chinesa tem sido complicada e turbulenta e a minha família não conseguiu preservar os detalhes dos nossos altos e baixos específicos. Tudo o que sei é que, em 1931, para fugir da ocupação japonesa, a minha avó levou o meu pai e outros membros da família e, juntos, caminharam até Chongqing, no sul. O meu pai ainda era um menino. Para sobreviver e cuidar melhor do filho e da família, a minha avó decidiu casar-se novamente com um clã local chamado Xing. The Xing family accepted the proposal, as long as my grandmother paid them 300 taels of silver, a significant amount in wartime China. Foi assim que mudámos o nosso apelido imperial Zhao para Xing. Depois de se casar novamente, a minha avó pediu ao meu pai para cavar um buraco no quintal. That's where the family heirloom was stored, until my father decided to pass it on to me. My father didn't want to divide the collection between my brothers, as he knew I was the only one who could appreciate its true value. To repay my father's appreciation for me, I immediately gave my private collection a name: Jade Ambience, 琼华幸境 in Chinese.
Joy: Why that name?
James: I feel like I've always been lucky in life, like I've always been protected by some supernatural force with which I could cure strange illnesses and save people. You know, I love helping people and I can't stand seeing sadness and injustice in the world. Since he was a child, he saved lives during the annual floods of the Yangtze River in Chongqing. I didn't fear for my own life, because I knew I was protected. Will it be a gift? I would like to believe so. I even abandoned my career as a successful businessman and decided I wanted to be a soldier, so I could actually contribute to my country instead of earning a lot of money. I even turned down an opportunity to go to the USA and run a company there. That was in 1989. My experiences in the army made me stronger, both physically and mentally. I value life's experiences because they make me understand the human world better and give me positive energy to appreciate each day. In some inexplicable way, I attribute all of this to the jade items in my collection (laughs).
JOy: In fact, Chinese people believe that jade stone radiates positive energy. Since ancient times, jade has been associated with protective power, healing power and immortality. What is the true value of your collection, in your opinion?
As I said, jade has a very special place in Chinese culture. Jade symbolizes moral integrity and virtue, which is the stone's central symbolic value.
Confucianism inextricably linked jade to the ideal of the “exemplary person” (junzi 君子), who should embody the virtues reflected in the physical qualities of jade, including benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, courage (“It is better to be a broken jade than an intact tile”) and purity.
Jade served as a material expression of authority and was made into ritual objects used to communicate with divine forces and symbolized imperial power—most notably through the legendary Imperial Seal made of jade. For ordinary Chinese people, jade offers protection and good luck and has long been considered a talisman against evil forces. Jade carvings also carry auspicious meanings: bats for blessings, peaches for longevity, and fish for abundance. In ancient belief systems, jade was believed to preserve the body and soul after death. This concept found its ultimate expression in the jade burial suits of the Han dynasty, intricately assembled from thousands of pieces of jade to ensure immortality. Jade was also seen as the essence of the cosmos—a fusion of the vital energies of heaven and earth. The Chinese language is rich in jade-related expressions that convey admiration and virtue! Therefore, jade items are timeless symbols of love, symbolizing lasting and sincere affection. Today, jade remains a precious heirloom, a solid investment, and a powerful emblem of cultural identity — connecting contemporary Chinese to our heritage. In this way, jade contains old and new life! Jade is not just a precious stone full of vitality. It is a cultural landmark — a bridge between old China and new China.
Joy: What do you want to do with your collection?
James: Right now, I'm planning to organize a traveling exhibition in Beijing, Shanghai and maybe Macau. As I said before, jade is full of vitality. Jade is a bridge between ancient China and modern China. So I don't want to limit my collection to the usual antique circles. I'm thinking about doing cross exhibitions with fashion, art and sport. I want jade to have a lively dialogue with contemporary, young and modern Chinese audiences!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Paulo Maia and Carmo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Cui Zizhong (1574-1644), the painter from Laiyang (Shandong), who lived in Beijing near the end of the Ming dynasty, was, in the North, a notable figure in the resurgence of figure painting that in the South, with Chen Hongshou (1599-1652), led this resurgence with strange representations of human figures and their environments.

Architect Nuno Soares believes that, before questioning the safety of bamboo, it is necessary to reinforce monitoring of the illegal use of flammable materials

Could an industry already at risk of extinction disappear more quickly than previously thought, due to the tragic fire in Hong Kong? The issue has been raised since, last week, a major fire in a residential complex under construction, in the Tai Po area, resulted in at least 159 deaths, according to the most recent report.
The skyscrapers had bamboo scaffolding and other flammable materials used in the construction process. On Friday, Hong Kong authorities concluded that the fire was worsened by flammable bamboo scaffolding and foam insulation panels. Furthermore, Hong Kong fire chief Andy Yeung corroborated what many testimonies interviewed by AFP stated. “We found that the alarm systems in the eight buildings were not working properly,” he said.
According to the Lusa agency, the report, still a preliminary expert, concluded that the materials used in works contributed to higher temperatures.
“Based on the initial information we have, we believe that the fire started in the protective screen (plastic material to protect against the spread of dust and falling objects) located on the outside of the lower floors (…), and quickly escalated due to the panels” that protected the windows, said the security chief of the neighboring special administrative region, Chris Tang.
To HM, the architect Nuno Soares, linked to the study of bamboo construction, and who has fought for its preservation, considers that before pointing blame at the material, it is necessary to reinforce the supervision of the shipyards.
"We know that bamboo is difficult to ignite. In other words, bamboo burns, but it is difficult to burn and, when it does, the combustion is slow, and it is easy to fight [a possible fire]. Now when there is a net around it, which is not fireproof, everything catches fire very quickly, right? There is already known data [on the incident], and we know that the scaffolding was, in fact, made of bamboo, but there was a plastic net around it which was not fireproof, in addition to the use of Styrofoam to cover the windows, which is a highly flammable material”, he highlighted.
Nuno Soares also referred to the occurrence, in Tai Po, of “problems with the fire detection and fighting system in the building itself, built in the 1980s, and which was already out of date”. “Several problems in inspection are also known, and with the data we have we are unable to conclude, in summary, that bamboo was the guiding principle in this situation, and we have to be rigorous in this type of analysis”, he added.
Therefore, Nuno Soares considers that caution is needed and not to enter into simplistic or hasty analyses. “We cannot, with the data we have at the moment, say that bamboo has no responsibility whatsoever.” "If there had been that nylon net around the metal scaffolding, a very similar situation would have happened, because the fire would have spread through that net and then through the Styrofoam on the windows. Fire safety regulations are already quite strict in Macau and Hong Kong, but where I think there is room for improvement is in inspection," he said.
A material question
The Global Times newspaper wrote on Monday about the difficulties in putting an end to the construction of bamboo scaffolding in a short period of time. In an article entitled “Tradition under fire”, we read that “some defenders argue that bamboo scaffolding, as a traditional construction technique, is low-cost, flexible to assemble and disassemble, and especially suitable for the tight spaces of old urban neighborhoods”, with “contrary voices that focus on security risks”.
Quoted by the same newspaper, Lee Kwong-sing, president of the Hong Kong Institute of Security Professionals, said that, given the available information, “the flammable materials on the external walls set fire to the safety nets, not the bamboo itself”. Demonstrating a similar position to Nuno Soares, the person in charge added that “even if metal scaffolding had been used, safety nets would have been necessary, and if flammable materials were not removed, the risk of fire would not change much”.
Zhao Shixing, chief engineer of the Sichuan Provincial Institute of Architectural Design and Research, told the Global Times that bamboo's weaknesses lie in its safety and stability, as raw and untreated bamboo has a B2 combustibility rating according to China's standards, and can easily ignite when exposed to other flammable materials. Zhao said, therefore, that “this vulnerability was completely exposed in this fire.”
According to the state newspaper, authorities in the neighboring city of Shenzhen had already banned the use of bamboo in 1994, and in January 2022 the country's Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development banned the use of “bamboo (or wooden) scaffolding” in construction and municipal engineering works across the country.
Difficult to erase tradition
In special administrative regions, the construction of bamboo scaffolding continues to be a reality, despite the alleged lack of younger personnel interested in learning the technique.
Nuno Soares highlights that the technique “is very deep-rooted”, having “existed for decades in Macau and Hong Kong”, surviving due to its versatility and being adaptable to local climate conditions. The architect also highlights among the decisive factors for the use of bamboo the “workmanship and type of high-rise constructions that are carried out in Macau and Hong Kong”.
In the hours following the accident, Macau authorities carried out a series of inspections of construction sites, in addition to organizing dozens of lectures to raise awareness of the risks of fires.
Such a stance was “wise and preventive”. "The bamboo scaffolding was not removed, but the flammable nets that were in several buildings in Macau were removed. What we need to do is more testing, that is, it is not enough to have the manufacturer's certificate saying that the material is fireproof. Inspection must be more rigorous."
“One of the reasons why I think bamboo scaffolding has been so successful throughout the recent history of Macau and Hong Kong is because it is safe, in the sense that it resists winds and typhoons well, and protects workers who wear protective elements”, highlighted the architect.
In general, Nuno Soares says that “it doesn’t make sense” to have a sudden, total ban on the use of bamboo in the construction of scaffolding. “Taking into account the data we have, this measure of preventing bamboo construction makes no sense.”
When the fire was still far from being extinguished, the police had already announced the arrest of three suspects for “gross negligence” after the discovery of flammable materials abandoned during work, which allowed the fire to “spread quickly” due to the strong wind. Investigations continue.
Quoted by CNN, Xinyan Huang, associate professor at the University of Hong Kong, declared that bamboo is “definitely a flammable material”. "This season is very dry in Hong Kong, so the possibility of the bamboo burning is very high. Once the combustion takes place, the fire spreads very quickly", he concluded.
In a joint note from the Fire Department, Directorate of Land and Urban Construction Services, Directorate of Labor Affairs Services and Institute for Municipal Affairs, on Friday, the Macao SAR Executive said it was “extremely attentive to the serious fire that recently occurred in the neighboring region”, but did not reveal whether or not it will ban the use of bamboo.
“After checking fire-fighting equipment, hazardous substance storage management and emergency evacuation routes, they all comply with applicable safety requirements.”
Furthermore, and mentioning more recent statistical data, it is stated that “there are currently around 566 construction sites in Macau, of which more than 60 involve works with scaffolding”, with the promise of carrying out “intensive inspections of all works with scaffolding, requiring contractors to strictly comply with their fire prevention responsibilities”.
However, the Executive admitted yesterday that it could replace bamboo scaffolding with metal ones, but only if there is “social consensus” between the population and construction companies, said Mak Tat Io, deputy director of Land and Urban Construction Services.</description><pubDate>2025-12-04 03:05:41</pubDate></item><item><title>OECD | World economy expected to slow to 2.9% in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/ocde-economia-mundial-deve-abrandar-para-29-em-2026/</link><description>The OECD predicts that global economic growth will slow down in 2026, falling from 3.2 percent this year to 2.9 percent next year, with economic activity facing “fragile prospects”, associated with the impact of tariffs on global trade.
In the Economic Perspectives report, released yesterday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) points to a moderation in the trajectory of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) globally, with growth slowing from 3.3 percent recorded in 2024 to 3.2 percent in 2025 and to 2.9 percent in 2026, followed by a “small recovery” to 3.1 percent in 2027.
“Growth is expected to slow down during the second half of this year [2025], as the anticipation of activity unfolds and higher effective customs duties on imports to the United States and China are reflected in company costs and final product prices, harming investment and trade growth”, describes the organization.
“The projections are based on the technical assumption that the bilateral tariffs announced in mid-November will be maintained for the rest of the projection period, despite ongoing legal challenges in the United States”, he highlights.
In the introduction to the report, OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann highlights that “the global economy has proven resilient this year, despite concerns about a more pronounced slowdown following the increase in trade barriers and significant political uncertainty”.
However, it warns that the increase in customs duties should “gradually lead to higher prices, reducing the growth of household consumption and business investment”.
“These prospects remain fragile”, warns the organization’s top official, stressing that if there is an increase in tariffs, this movement is expected to cause “significant damage to supply chains and global production” and there is a risk that high asset valuations, made “based on optimistic expectations of corporate profits” driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI), will lead to “potentially abrupt price corrections”.
Asia on the rise
In the document, the OECD notes that “high geopolitical and political uncertainty will also continue to weigh on domestic demand in many economies”, with emerging Asian economies expected to continue to be “responsible for the majority of global growth”.
For the United States of America, the OECD predicts GDP growth to be “2.0 percent in 2025, 1.7 percent in 2026 and 1.9 percent in 2027”.
China is expected to grow 5.0 percent in 2025, 4.4 percent in 2026 and 4.3 percent in 2027. In the second world economy, says the organization, “the end of the anticipation of exports, the imposition of higher customs duties on exports to the United States, the continued adjustment in the real estate sector and the weakening of budgetary support are expected to reduce growth”.
Eurozone growth “is expected to slow slightly, from 1.3 percent in 2025 to 1.2 percent in 2026, before increasing to 1.4 percent in 2027, with increased trade frictions being offset by improved financial conditions, continued capital spending from Recovery and Resilience Mechanism funds, and the resilience of labor markets,” says the OECD.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 08:08:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Five Year Plan | Economist highlights focus on solving internal problems</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/plano-quinquenal-economista-destaca-foco-na-resolucao-de-problemas-internos/</link><description>Economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu understands that the Central Government's 15th Five-Year Plan aims to consolidate regional economic aspects and resolve “aspects of the Chinese economy that are still problematic”, such as “weak domestic demand”. The position was taken at a seminar promoted by the Chinese Embassy in Lisbon
What are the objectives proposed in China's 15th Five-Year Plan, whose public consultation ended on November 14th? For economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, former Macau resident and president of the Friends of the New Silk Road Association (ANRS), the plan could respond to “some aspects of the Chinese economy that are still problematic, such as weak domestic demand”.
The position was taken at a seminar, held recently in Lisbon and promoted by the Chinese Embassy in Portugal, entitled “Interpretation of the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of China. Perspectives for Future China-Portugal Cooperation”. Maria Fernanda Ilhéu's speech, consulted by HM, was published by her on social media.
For Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, “despite government stimuli, domestic consumption remains low in its contribution to GDP [Gross Domestic Product]”, and “some bottlenecks and obstacles are impeding economic flows, such as the delay in agricultural and rural modernization and the pressure on employment”.
At this point, the economist highlighted the “graduates who do not find jobs that match their qualifications”, in addition to the fact that the country still hopes to achieve “per capita income growth, which is intended to be more accelerated and balanced in regions that are still very poor”. In turn, there are still “some difficulties in public services and social support”, while “the aging of the population presents challenges to economic development and the provision of services for the well-being of the population over 65 years of age”.
Maria Fernanda Ilhéu cited data on this aspect, relating to 2024, when the elderly represented 14.1 percent of the population, 4.7 percent more compared to 2014.
Based on the document presented by Beijing, the economist said that the 15th Five-Year Plan also intends to “project the Chinese economy towards self-sustainability and global competition”, and, in her view, the country faces “three challenges”.
They are the “great volubility” which is described by Chinese authorities as “strategic opportunities that exist alongside risks and challenges, while uncertainties and unpredictable factors are growing”.
A changing model
Maria Fernanda Ilhéu also highlights that “China's growth model is changing, with population changes, corrections in the real estate sector and decreasing returns on investment in infrastructure, requiring new factors to maintain the pace of growth”. Furthermore, “technology has become fundamental on the stage of global competition”, something that “requires and pressures China towards self-reliant innovation and industrial resilience”.
The economist does not forget the regional issues, which Macau is included in, particularly regarding the “objective for some cities and super regions” and the “dynamizing role of the Yangtze River Delta and the Guangdong-Hong Kong – Macau Greater Bay Area”.
In this context, the aim is to “achieve progress in industrialization, computerization, urbanization and agricultural modernization through new forms of production, and fostering new patterns of development”. The idea is that there will be a “modernization of the industry”, in which the “frontline sectors” will be “artificial intelligence (AI), advanced robotics, quantum computing, semiconductors, biotechnologies and new generation of information and aerospace technology”.
For Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, these areas are “foundational in a strategy of international competitiveness, resilience and growth multiplier effects”.
The importance of Lusophony
The economist also defended that the lines drawn up in the 15th Five-Year Plan point to the promotion of the Yangtze River Delta, including the province of Zhejiang, “homeland of the majority of overseas Chinese who chose Portugal to live and work”, or even, in the Greater Bay Area, which includes Macau, “one of the central vertices, where the centuries-old Portuguese presence is a strategic asset in cooperation between Portugal and China”.
For her, the “priority areas of cooperation” should focus on green energy, namely battery production, green hydrogen and mobility, “sectors where China leads”. Digitalization and AI, particularly in the construction of “digital health” and “smart cities” tools, in terms of logistics and ports. Other strategic points are infrastructure, health, biotechnology and cooperation in scientific research and industrial production in AI, he pointed out.
Bet on consumption
According to an analysis by the China Briefing portal, linked to the consultancy Dezan Shira &amp; Associates, China is currently in “very different conditions” compared to the last Five-Year Plan. Today the worst phase and consequent impacts of Covid-19 appear to have passed, however, there is “pressure on domestic industries” that will continue “to shape economic policy in the coming years”. Furthermore, the fact that Donald Trump is once again in the White House is highlighted, referring to the United States as “the largest individual trading partner and main economic rival”.
In this way, the Five-Year Plan designed for the years 2026 to 2030 “will be drawn up with these issues in mind”, and “priorities will probably focus on improving economic resilience, including the diversification of trading partners and reducing dependence on imports” of products and materials considered “critical”.
It is also intended to “stimulate domestic consumption and improve internal capabilities in key technologies”.
The same analysis reflects a speech given by President Xi Jinping, in April this year, in which he points out that the 15th Five-Year Plan must “practically evaluate how changes in the international scenario affect China”, and an adjustment must be made, “optimizing the country's economic structure”.
Regarding the promotion of domestic consumption, highlight is the announcement, on November 26th, of an action plan presented by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, which aims, according to the state agency Xinhua, “the formation of multimillion-dollar consumer sectors in the coming years”.
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) seems to be the norm, such as smart refrigerators “that can recommend a shopping list and glasses that can respond to various user commands”.
Xinhua writes about the aforementioned plan that “China intends to form three massive consumption sectors, namely elderly care products, smart connected vehicles and consumer electronics, with a market scale that will reach trillions of yuan by 2027”. In addition, “ten categories of high-demand consumer goods worth 100 billion yuan (about 14 billion US dollars) will be promoted, including products for children and babies, smart wearable devices, cosmetics, fitness equipment, and food and pet products.”
Double news
The fourth plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, held in October, adopted recommendations for the Five-Year Plan, which focused on maintaining the “domestic demand expansion strategy” with efforts “to ensure that new demand drives new supply”, also promoting “positive interactions between consumption and investment and between supply and demand”.
Not even on purpose, the China Briefing portal adds that the 15th Five-Year Plan “should dedicate significant space to the development of the ‘AI Plus’ initiative and supporting sectors, with policies aimed at promoting investment, fiscal support, talent training and public-private collaborations”.
The 15th Five-Year Plan should also “define carbon emission targets and realign the decarbonization strategy”, and the country “is changing the main decarbonization strategy”, moving “from the focus on reducing total energy consumption to concentrating on reducing total carbon emissions”.
It is worth highlighting the fact that the final version of the 15th Five-Year Plan will only be presented during the so-called Two Sessions of March next year, of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, when it will be adopted and implemented by the authorities in Beijing.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:32:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Evolution | African genomes point to the origins of the human species</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/evolucao-genomas-africanos-apontam-origens-da-especie-humana/</link><description>Homo sapiens has existed for at least 300,000 years, but its exact origin remains unknown and a new study has ruled out the hypothesis that it evolved in East Africa and expanded south. The study, based on the analysis of ancient genomes of people who lived from the Stone Age – 10,200 years ago – to 150 years ago in southern Africa, argues that a group of individuals lived in partial isolation for several hundred thousand years.
By analyzing their genomes, researchers found genetic adaptations that likely shaped H. sapiens as a species. Details of the study – the most comprehensive to date on ancient African DNA – conducted by researchers from Uppsala University (Sweden) and the University of Johannesburg, were published on Wednesday in the magazine “Nature”, reported the agency Efe.
“We have long known that Southern Africa was inhabited (…). We can now demonstrate that Homo sapiens existed and evolved in Southern Africa over a long period and that this region played a significant role in human evolution, perhaps the most important of all”, highlighted Mattias Jakobsson, geneticist at Uppsala University and main author of the study.
The team analyzed the ancient genomes of 28 individuals from southern Africa and compared them with those of their contemporaries from other parts of the world. They discovered that the Stone Age inhabitants of southern Africa lived in isolation for a long period.
“This group appears to have remained genetically isolated for at least 200,000 years, and it was only around 1,400 years ago that clear traces of genetic flow within this group began to emerge, when DNA from individuals from East and West Africa began to appear in individuals from Southern Africa,” explained Jakobsson.
Although no new groups migrated to southern Africa until about 1,400 years ago, genetic data suggests that members of the southern population migrated north during certain climatic periods. In fact, genetic material — dating back to around 8,000 years ago — from this southern population has been found in individuals from present-day Malawi, making it possible that southern migrations also occurred earlier.
Techniques and variations
A large part of the human remains analyzed were found in the Matjes River Rock Shelter (South Africa), an archaeological site with remains dating back approximately 10,000 to 1,500 years. This site also revealed different tools from each historical period, made with different techniques.
However, the individuals are genetically practically identical throughout the entire period, that is, there is no evidence of immigration or population exchange, “exactly the opposite of what happened in Europe, where cultural changes tend to coincide with population migrations”, analyzed Jakobsson.
In the study, researchers identified 79 DNA variants unique to Homo sapiens, distinct from those found in Neanderthals, Denisovans, chimpanzees and gorillas. Seven of these variants, related to kidney function, were “clearly overrepresented”.
The authors believe that these variants are linked to the unique human ability to cool the body through sweat, which requires a good ability to regulate the body's water balance. They also found variants involved in the immune system and neuronal growth. More than 40 percent of these variants are associated with neurons and brain growth, suggesting a role in cognitive evolution.
Additionally, several genes have been linked to attention, a mental ability that may have evolved differently in Homo sapiens compared to Neanderthals and Denisovans.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:56:30</pubDate></item><item><title>What is known about the fire that killed 151 people in Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/29/o-que-se-sabe-sobre-o-incendio-que-matou-128-pessoas-em-hong-kong/</link><description>Hong Kong continued today to count the victims of the fire that devastated a residential complex on Wednesday, the most serious in decades, with at least 151 dead. Authorities in the neighboring Chinese special administrative region of Macau detained 11 people on suspicion of negligence, but the cause of the fire has not yet been determined.
Here is what is known about the tragedy, according to the France-Presse (AFP) news agency:
What happened?
The fire alarm was raised at 2:50 pm on Wednesday. The fire hit a real estate complex with 1,984 homes and eight towers of 31 floors each, called Wang Fuk Court, located in Tai Po, in the New Territories, in the north of Hong Kong. The complex, opened in 1983, was undergoing renovation work, but continued to be occupied by around four thousand people who lived there.
Immense flames spread extremely quickly between the buildings, which were surrounded by bamboo scaffolding and protective nets. Hundreds of firefighters were mobilized to provide assistance and extinguish the fire. Firefighters only declared the end of operations against the fire this morning (Friday).
How many victims?
The most recent provisional balance this afternoon was 128 dead [151 is the most recent number], of which 89 had not yet been identified, according to Hong Kong's security chief, Chris Tang. More than a hundred people were still missing at the same time. There were also 79 injured, 11 of which were in critical condition. Family members toured hospitals and morgues looking for victims.
It is the deadliest building fire worldwide since 1980, excluding fires in nightclubs, prisons or shopping centers, according to research in the disaster database at the University of Leuven (Belgium). It is also the most serious in Hong Kong since 1948.
It is still unknown to what extent the balance could increase due to the number of people about whom there is still no news. Among the missing people, there are 19 Filipino and 11 Indonesian domestic workers, according to data from the Mission for Migrant Workers organization cited by the local newspaper South China Morning Post (SCMP). Firefighters finished their inspection of all homes today, Friday.
What caused the tragedy?
The initial causes of the fire have not been rigorously established. The security chief admitted that the investigation could take three or four weeks. Based on preliminary findings, Tang said that the fire started in the lower parts of the shipyard's nets that protected against dust and falling objects.
The spread of the flames, according to Tang, was favored by the use of bamboo for scaffolding, common in Hong Kong, and flammable materials such as foam panels that protected the windows. Hong Kong fire chief Andy Yeung also corroborated what many witnesses interviewed by AFP said. “We found that the alarm systems in the eight buildings were not working properly,” he said.
Who is responsible?
The anti-corruption commission announced today the arrest of seven men and one woman, aged between 40 and 63. These are two people responsible for the project office that prepared the renovation, two construction managers, three scaffolding subcontractors and an intermediary.
The police had already announced the arrest of three suspects for “gross negligence” after the discovery of flammable materials abandoned during work, which allowed the fire to “spread quickly” due to the strong wind. The exact level of involvement of the suspects in starting the fire is unclear. Authorities ordered the inspection of all public housing complexes undergoing major renovations, according to the SCMP newspaper.
What is the fire risk in Hong Kong?
Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China with 7.5 million inhabitants, is one of the most densely populated places in the world, which increases the risk of urban disasters. The average population density is more than 7,100 inhabitants per square kilometer, with vast steep and unbuildable areas.
In urbanized areas, population density is up to three times higher, a world record. This financial center, where space is limited and real estate prices are among the highest in the world, is famous for the skyscrapers surrounding the bay. The last few decades have been marked by the construction of a profusion of residential towers that can have more than 50 floors.
Most of the new construction projects have taken place in the mainland of the green New Territories region, where the Tai Po neighborhood is located. Hong Kong has 569 buildings over 150 meters tall, the highest number in the world, according to data from the specialized international NGO CTBUH (Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat).</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Deadliest fire since 1918 leads to investigation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/28/hong-kong-fogo-mais-mortifero-desde-1918-origina-investigacao/</link><description>There have been 128 deaths and 200 people missing in what was the biggest fire in the history of Hong Kong, in the New Territories. Authorities have, however, moved towards an anti-corruption investigation given the scale of the incident in Tai Po. The Lusa agency reports the despair of many families
The tragedy is far from abating in Hong Kong. The fire that occurred this Wednesday in the Tai Po area, in the New Territories, in a complex of buildings under construction, is already considered one of the largest in the history of the territory and the victims are still being counted – at the time of writing this edition there were 55 dead and 250 people missing. Today, Friday, the numbers rose to 128 dead and 200 missing. Yesterday, at the end of the day, the fire was gradually coming under control, with another 55 survivors being rescued.
According to a report from the Lusa agency, the families of those missing remained in a feeling of despair yesterday, given the lack of answers. “Did you see this girl?” a mother asks the Lusa journalist in Cantonese, before switching to English. “Did you see my daughter or the ‘helper’?” he says, using the expression used in Hong Kong for domestic workers.
The woman, surnamed Cheng, waves a piece of paper on which she has printed a photograph of her five-year-old daughter, Hannah Cheng, and a copy of the work permit of her maid, Indonesian Maryan. The family lived in Wang Tai House, part of the Wang Fuk Court residential complex that burned down.
A spokeswoman for the Indonesian consulate in Hong Kong confirmed to the South China Morning Post that the dead included two Indonesian maids.
"I haven't seen them since the fire started. Please, have you seen them?", Cheng begs everyone he meets at the entrance to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole, the hospital located closest to the social housing complex, in Tai Po.
The fire department said it had already managed to contact several of the 279 people who were initially listed as missing. The temperature “is very high and there are floors where we cannot contact the people who called for help, but we will continue to try”, assured the deputy director of the fire department, Derek Armstrong Chan.
A post was circulating on social media from another mother, desperate for not being able to contact her in-laws, who were taking care of her six-month-old daughter, in Wang Fuk Court.
"Almost 24 hours have passed [since the last contact] (…) My daughter needs to be breastfed otherwise she will die. Can anyone tell me if she was saved or not?", wrote Winnie Hui.
This is already the deadliest fire since 1918, when Hong Kong was still a British colony. That year, a fire caused the collapse of the main grandstand at the Happy Valley racecourse, causing more than 600 deaths. More than 700 firefighters are involved in fighting the flames, in addition to rescue teams and police.
Population helps
As the hours passed, support from the population began to arrive, both in terms of physical and financial presence, at various shelters for the homeless. Serena, 16, was carrying a box of bottled water to deliver to a secondary school in Tai Po, converted into one of the temporary shelters for those affected by the fire.
In addition to the 900 residents of the Wang Fuk Court residential complex, authorities ordered residents of the nearby Kwong Fuk Estate to evacuate their homes as a precaution.
“This is my school, but we don't have classes today because of the fire”, explains the young woman to Lusa, who joined several colleagues to buy and donate supplies, including cookies and instant pasta. The school is just over two kilometers from the residential complex that burned down.
On the second day, columns of smoke continued to rise into the sky, with the smell of burning in the air. “Everyone knows someone who lived in Wang Fuk”, highlights Serena. “We never thought this could happen here”, he adds.
But it is not only in Tai Po, located closer to the border with the metropolis of Shenzhen than to the center of Hong Kong, that the population has mobilized to help. An elderly woman came from Tuen Mun, 30 kilometers away, with blankets and clothes. “It’s not enough for someone who lost everything they had”, laments the resident, surnamed Fong.
The social neighborhood, built in the 1980s, is made up of eight towers with nearly 30 floors and a total of 1,984 apartments, where around four thousand people lived. According to the local press, the fire also led many people to try to donate blood, running out of appointments in the center of Causeway Bay yesterday.
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Government created a fund this Thursday with 300 million Hong Kong dollars for the victims. At a press conference, postponed twice, the Chief Executive, John Lee Ka-chiu, said that the fund, created at the state-owned Bank of China, began accepting donations from 7pm.
John Lee also announced that the Government would distribute, throughout the day, 10 thousand Hong Kong dollars to each family affected by the fire in the Wang Fuk Court social housing complex.
Ongoing investigations
The scale of the tragedy has already led Hong Kong authorities to move forward with an anti-corruption investigation. Hong Kong's Independent Anti-Corruption Commission has set up “a working group to launch a full investigation into possible corruption in the major Wang Fuk Court renovation project in Tai Po.”
In a statement, the commission justified the decision with “the immense public interest involved”. There are now three working groups: one to investigate the fire, another to deal with emergency donation resources and one for the relocation of affected families.
Meanwhile, police arrested three men on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter after discovering flammable materials left during maintenance work that led to the fire spreading quickly through the bamboo floors.
John Lee, Chief Executive of the HKSAR, said the Department of Home Affairs and Youth has reserved 1,000 apartments in youth hostels and hotels for affected residents to stay for a maximum period of two weeks. They will then be moved to 1,800 subsidized apartments reserved for them to settle in temporarily, he added.
The official also indicated that the Government is preparing a list of goods that Hong Kong will request from China's central government, including unmanned aircraft ('drones') for inspections and materials for laboratory tests.
Meanwhile, inspections are also being carried out at all real estate complexes that are undergoing major works. “The Government ordered the inspection of all real estate complexes in the city that are undergoing major renovations, to check the safety of scaffolding and construction materials,” said John Lee Ka-chiu in a message published on the social network Facebook. The complex of eight 31-storey buildings was undergoing facade renovations.
Campaign suspended
The leader of the Hong Kong Government admitted yesterday that the elections for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, scheduled for December 7, could be postponed. “We will carry out a thorough analysis and make a decision within a few days, based on the overall interests of Hong Kong,” said John Lee Ka-chiu, after an emergency meeting with heads of various government departments. The Chief Executive added that the debates between candidates for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong that were scheduled for Thursday and today have been postponed, with no new date set. The remaining election campaign activities were also suspended, John Lee told journalists. "The Government is committed to dealing with this major disaster. Our priority now is to fight the fire", highlighted the leader. "The top priority is to extinguish the fire and rescue the trapped residents. The second task is to treat the injured, the third is to deal with the consequences, and then we will carry out a thorough investigation," Lee added. "As for other matters, we will decide what to do in a few days, after we coordinate our work," said the government leader.
Leaders react
Xi Jinping, Chinese President, yesterday expressed condolences for the victims of the fire, calling for “intense rescue efforts to minimize losses”, reported the Xinhua agency. The President also declared that he gave great importance to the accident, having immediately requested permanent updates on the work of the rescue team. Xi Jinping instructed the director of the Central Government Liaison Office in Hong Kong to convey condolences. Another political leader who also spoke out about the tragedy was the Prime Minister of Timor-Leste, Xanana Gusmão. He referred to the death of the 128 people as “tragic” and “deeply painful”. “Our hearts are with the families and friends of all those who lost their lives, as well as with those who remain missing”, he highlighted, in a press release. Xanana Gusmão also paid tribute to the “extraordinary courage of firefighters, first responders and all those who work tirelessly in rescue and recovery operations”.</description><pubDate>2025-11-28 20:29:00</pubDate></item><item><title>East Timor | April Revolution left “difficult memories”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/27/timor-leste-revolucao-de-abril-deixou-memorias-dificeis/</link><description>Marisa Ramos Gonçalves, researcher at the University of Coimbra, addresses, in a study, the experiences of the Timorese during the period of the 25th of April
Marisa Ramos Gonçalves, a researcher at the Center for Social Sciences at the University of Coimbra, considered that the April revolution in Timor-Leste left “difficult memories” and that reconciliation is fundamental for “national cohesion”.
“When we talk about the 25th of April in Timor, we know that we are talking about difficult memories that have left marks to this day due to the internal conflict and the violation of human rights during the occupation”, Marisa Ramos Gonçalves, who is currently carrying out a study on that period in the country, told Lusa.
Marisa Ramos Gonçalves is also a member of the International Advisory Board of the National Chega Center (in Timor-Leste), which, among other activities, documents the history of the conflict in Timor-Leste between 1974 and 1999.
The researcher explained to Lusa that the objective is to understand the other side of the story “based on the experiences of the Timorese of the 25th of April and this period of transition, which gives rise to a proclamation of independence, but which is very short compared to the occupation”.
“This collective memory of the Timorese is inseparable, both from the internal conflict and from the human tragedy that is the Indonesian invasion and occupation”, highlighted Marisa Ramos Gonçalves.
The unilateral proclamation of Timor-Leste's independence, on November 28, 1975, came after a period marked by clashes between the East Timorese and already under the shadow of the possibility of occupation of the territory by Indonesia, which came to fruition on December 7, 1975. Asked about reconciliation between East Timorese, the researcher said that the “issue has been on the table”.
"It is necessary to achieve reconciliation between Timorese who were on opposite sides during the civil conflict with different options for the future of Timor. At the time, UDT wanted an association with Portugal for a few more years before independence, Fretilin wanted immediate independence, and Apodeti, which wanted integration into Indonesia and they are all Timorese", he stated.
According to Marisa Gonçalves, the National Chega Center wants “this to start being on the table, because it has not been easy until now for Timorese who suffered torture or were persecuted during the period of internal conflict to speak openly”.
"But we are already beginning to see this possibility when talking about violence and torture, which existed for a very short period in 1975, but which left strong marks. There is also a reconciliation at the level of political leadership that is yet to be achieved and I think this is also complicated. It is a reconciliation of the entire society", stated Marisa Ramos Gonçalves.
Larger opening
Considering reconciliation between Timorese people as fundamental for social cohesion, the researcher highlights, on the other hand, that the new generations formed in the Indonesian period and the younger ones “are completely prepared for this reconciliation”.
“They are not so tied to previous conflicts and they really want to reconcile and, therefore, I think they are already looking at that future, they already think that all people are part of the Timorese Nation, including the Timorese who are in West Timor”, where there is a community of around 80,000 people, he highlighted.
"It is also important that the older generation reconciles, especially because it is still a generation, the so-called generation of 75, that continues in power. It would also be interesting for them to take the initiative to get closer", he added.
Regarding the study she is carrying out, Marisa Ramos Gonçalves said that there is a lack of historical research in Timor-Leste and that it is good to understand the expectations that people had not only in relation to the 25th of April, but also in relation to the political transition.
“It means knowing the narratives, the experiences, the memories of Timorese people of various geographic origins, professional occupations and party affiliations about the same historical moment”, he explained, highlighting that reconciliation is also achieved through the writing of history.</description><pubDate>2025-11-27 02:00:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Taxis | Request more services per application</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/taxis-pedidos-mais-servicos-por-aplicacao/</link><description>The Association of Automobile Traders and Workers of Macau considers that Macau should have mobile phone applications to hail taxis similar to Didi or Uber, calling on the Government to bring this service to the territory when launching the public consultation to review the regulations on passenger transport in Taxis.
Speaking to the newspaper Ou Mun, the president of the association, Leng Sai Vai, praised the importance of this type of service, stressing that currently taxi drivers can only have customers in nearby areas, such as casinos or border posts, with customers in areas further away from stopping points having difficulty calling a vehicle. The person in charge believes that creating these applications in Macau can bring more customers, increasing the effectiveness of the service and providing greater convenience to passengers.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:18:21</pubDate></item><item><title>APAVT | Macau is international “Preferred Destination” in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/apavt-macau-e-destino-preferido-internacional-em-2026/</link><description>The Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies once again chose Macau as the association's Preferred Destination in 2026, which will allow for reinforced cooperation. Helena de Senna Fernandes praised the continuation of the good work resulting from the partnership with the Portuguese association
"Macau and the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT) decided that they should not stop. That is why I convey to you with great joy that we have decided, Macau and APAVT, that Macau will be APAVT's preferred international destination throughout 2026", stated the president of APAVT, Pedro Costa Ferreira in the territory.
The 50th APAVT National Congress, which has been taking place since Tuesday in Macau, ended yesterday, and was attended by more than a thousand professionals, a record number, to debate the future of the tourism sector. Macau hosted for the sixth time what is considered the largest congress in the Portuguese tourism sector.
"I can't be happier. You know my status in my last term. I'm fulfilling a dream, which is to return to Macau and work with Macau again. (…) The Congress has been, in my opinion, memorable from the point of view of the themes, but it has also been memorable from the point of view of the number, it is the biggest ever, and it has been memorable from the point of view of reception capacity", reinforced Pedro Costa Ferreira.
APAVT's Preferred Destination is a “very broad” program, which has two fundamental parts, communication and marketing, and which, in this way, helps the chosen destination to promote itself. “It means that in all our presences, we will have Macau with us and, therefore, we have this communication”, added the president of the association, remembering that in this way a relationship that has existed for many years is reinforced.
Old friends
“The return of Congress to our city this year and the designation of Macau, along with China, as a Preferred Destination for 2026, paves the way for us to continue working well”, said the director of Tourism Services, Helena de Senna Fernandes.
The main new feature of Destino Preferido in 2026 will be the launch of an 'e-learning' program about Macau for travel agents from Germany, Finland and the Netherlands, just like the program that was launched in Portugal in 2024. The 'e-learning' will be developed by APAVT and Macau Tourism, in collaboration with the European Confederation of Associations of Travel Agencies and Tour Operators (European Confederation of Travel Agents’ and Tour Operators’ Associations [ECTAA]).
Pedro Costa Ferreira also recalled that this congress has several “special meanings”, firstly “because it is the sixth” in Macau and because it was chosen “to conclude the celebration of the 75th anniversary” of the association. APAVT says it has accredited 1,039 congressmen from 172 different flights, congressmen who “will now visit several provinces in China in collaboration with Macau Tourism”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:17:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Airport | Secretary speaks of “strategic asset”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/aeroporto-secretario-fala-em-activo-estrategico/</link><description>Raymond Tam, Secretary for Transport and Public Works, said yesterday, in connection with the 30th anniversary of Macau International Airport (AIM), that this infrastructure has become “an engine of socio-economic development” for the territory, as well as “an essential gateway for Macau's integration into regional development and international cooperation”.

The official also highlighted that the pieces on display build a clear line of patriotic education, revealing the struggles that took place in China's modern history.  Ieng Weng Fat, historian, stated that the Cultural Institute improved the general's presentation, allowing the public to learn about the contributions that Ye Ting made during the Second World War, in the fight against the Japanese invasion, to learn more about patriotic education and to foster, among young people, a love for Macau.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:13:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Work | Two-thirds rest only 1 or 1.5 days a week</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/trabalho-dois-tercos-descansam-apenas-1-ou-15-dias-por-semana/</link><description>A FAOM survey revealed that around 60 percent of workers did not receive a salary update this year and two thirds did not have a two-day weekly rest. Leong Sun Iok wants the Government to give clear guidance to companies to prioritize hiring residents and set a minimum quota for locals
Frozen wages, work overload, financial insecurity and unfair competition with very low wages from non-residents were the main concerns revealed by around 2,000 workers who responded to a survey on working conditions in 2025. The work, presented yesterday, was carried out by the Macau Workers' Associations (FAOM).
For 60 percent of those interviewed, there were no salary increases this year, while 10 percent even had salary cuts. Furthermore, close to two-thirds of workers complained of an excessive workload, with their weekly rest period reduced to one day or one and a half days.
Another situation that disrupts the balance between life and work is technological access that allows work tasks to be transferred to free time and home. This situation once again became the target of complaints from workers, leading FAOM officials to ask the Government to clearly define the parameters of the “right to be offline”. To achieve this, workers must be entitled to overtime compensation, or shift work wages.
In addition to these problems, there were frequent reports of a lack of stability and financial “cushion”, causing feelings of insecurity regarding the future.
The bogeyman
Echoing one of FAOM's political slogans, interviewees consider that labor policies do not effectively prioritize local people in access to employment. As such, 63 percent of respondents revealed a lack of clarity in the protection measures for resident workers.
At this point, deputy Leong Sun Iok, stated that “although current laws already define the priority of local residents, the Government has never outlined clear requirements for companies in relation to human resources hiring practices”. The result is a lack of effectiveness in achieving the priority.
One solution, pointed out by the deputy, would be the firm application of quotas or minimum proportion of residents in the human resources of each company, as happens with management positions in gaming concessionaires. Leong Sun Iok believes that in this way, employers would be “incentivized” to train local employees.
The excessively low wages of non-resident workers, and the resulting unfair competition caused by the salary gap, was highlighted by 60 percent of respondents. Leong Sun Iok argues that the Government should refuse requests to hire non-residents when the salaries proposed by employers are too low.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:12:12</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Che Sai Wang wants faster disassembly</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/04/gp-macau-che-sai-wang-quer-desmontagens-mais-rapidas/</link><description>The deputy is concerned about the road removal works and points out that the delay disrupts the number of parking spaces, the transport of children to schools and makes life difficult for residents.
Che Sai Wang defended the need for the Government to speed up work on dismantling the Macau Grand Prix facilities. The position of the deputy linked to the Macau Public Service Workers Association (ATFPM) was taken in a written questioning.
According to the interview, Che is a supporter of the Grand Prix, which he stated is “a milestone in Macau's identity, with positive impacts on tourism, the economy and international visibility”. “It continues to be a vital component of the Government’s strategy to establish Macau as an ‘Event City’”, he highlighted.
However, unlike what happens with the assemblies, Che expects the work to remove the track and additional facilities to be faster. “Although the Government demonstrates high efficiency in pre-race construction, the removal of barriers and restoration of roads and community functions after the event often proceed at a different pace – slow, time-consuming and without clear communication”, he reported.
The deputy also indicates that this position is based on the population's complaints: “Numerous residents report that, days after the end of the event, sections of the roads remain partially blocked by barriers and temporary installations are not removed, with areas around the reservoir and close to the Greater Lisbon curve being the most affected”, he said. "Roads are not fully back to normal and designated parking spaces remain unavailable, seriously disrupting daily commutes, school transport, child pick-up and commercial deliveries. This exacerbates traffic congestion and diversions," he added.
More information
Having presented the problem, the deputy wants to know if the Government will start to better disseminate information with the calendar of dismantling work in different areas of the territory. “Will the services consider publishing a clear and publicly accessible ‘Post-Event Restoration Progress Bulletin’ in the future?” “This bulletin must detail the calendar of dismantling works by road section, being updated daily, clearly showing the progress of dismantling, reopening times, parking arrangements and explanations for any delays caused by road closures”, he indicated.
The deputy also questioned the Executive about the definition of strict deadlines for dismantling work, to combat the “phenomenon of ‘fast construction, but slow dismantling’”. Finally, Che Sai Wang questions whether the definition of strict deadlines for dismantling can be applied in contracts awarding the assembly of the runway to complementary facilities, to resolve the problem.</description><pubDate>2025-12-04 03:13:58</pubDate></item><item><title>IAM | Chao Wai Ieng with renewed mandate</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/04/iam-chao-wai-ieng-com-mandato-renovado/</link><description>The mandate of the president of the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM), Chao Wai Ieng, was renewed until May 31, according to an order from the Chief Executive published yesterday in the Official Bulletin.

It should be noted that Brazil, a country rich in oil, the eighth producer in the world, had the courage to host COP30. The first few days were not very encouraging, with several popular demonstrations taking place, some promoted by indigenous people from the Amazon.
There was even a tense moment when a group of representatives of the Munduruku people, made up of indigenous people from the Amazon basin, blocked the entrance to the Conference facilities, forcing hundreds of delegates to remain outside for some time, in torrid heat. The main motivation for this demonstration can be attributed to the fact that these people were victims of illegal gold mining, the construction of hydroelectric plants and deforestation. Despite the measures taken by the current Brazilian government to prohibit the illegal exploration of minerals, several rivers in the Amazon basin continue to be polluted due to this exploitation. Although the era of land grabbers1 is already in decline, the indigenous people of the Amazon continue to be the target of illegal practices by those who try to occupy the lands allocated to them by law.
There were other demonstrations with a significant number of participants, including a parade with more than two hundred boats with around 5,000 participants, in Guajará Bay, where the Acará, Guamá and Moju rivers converge. The protests, in addition to addressing climate change, also focused on various aspects related to the exploration of minerals, particularly with regard to projects promoted by Canada in South American countries. In addition to the demonstrations, the organization was faced with a fire in one of the Blue Zone pavilions, an area intended for official meetings between delegations and press conferences. Not since COP26 (Glasgow, 2021) have there been such expressive demonstrations against the mildness with which governments deal with the climate crisis.
There is no doubt that the current government of Brazil is committed to the fight against deforestation and other illegal practices with strong repercussions on the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), the main cause, according to the IPCC, of ​​climate change. Contrary to the previous government, headed by an avowed denialist, who refused to allow the 25th Conference of the Parties to take place in Brazil, breaking a previous commitment, the current president committed himself to hosting the 30th COP. There is, however, a certain ambiguity in the Brazilian political system: while the president pulls one way, the National Congress often pulls the other. This is what happened with the so-called “Devastation Bill”, also referred to as the General Environmental Licensing Law. While Lula da Silva was ideologically on the side of environmentalists, vetoing several aspects related to environmental protection of this bill, it returned to the National Congress, which annulled most of the vetoes, which allows offshore oil exploration to go ahead, relatively close to the mouth of the Amazon River, which could have strong environmental implications.

The Conference began on the 10th and ended on November 22nd, one day later than the scheduled date. The extension was due to the incompatibility between several participants' points of view on the final declaration. As in previous conferences, there were serious disagreements about the final text, given that, for some, it would be important to renew (and reinforce) what had already been previously agreed with regard to the abandonment of fossil fuels and, for others, it would be to camouflage this recommendation. Unfortunately, it was the latter who imposed their will, meaning that the recommendation expressed at COP 28 (Dubai, 2023) was not renewed, in which, for the first time, the need to abandon fossil fuels and accelerate the energy transition was officially recognized. The main opponents to this reference, in the final declaration, were Saudi Arabia, India and the Russian Federation. The European Union ended up giving in after ensuring that some of its red lines would be respected, namely inserting in the final text the mention of the need to not exceed the 1.5 ºC increase in global warming by the end of the 21st century (in relation to pre-industrial levels) and the objective of tripling the budget for adaptation to climate change in developing countries
António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, addressing journalists during COP30, emphasized that no country can combat the climate crisis in isolation, and that the Conference demonstrated that multilateralism remains active.
It cannot be said that the success of COP21 and COP28 was achieved, in the first of which (Paris, 2015) the Paris Agreement was adopted, a legally binding treaty that involved almost all countries in the world, which committed to making efforts to ensure that the increase in global warming did not exceed 2°C, preferably less than 1.5°C, and to proceed with the preparation of so-called Nationally Determined Contributions. NDCs2”), to be updated every five years. However, some progress has been made in recognizing that the main victims of climate change are those who have contributed least to climate degradation. The “Belém Action Mechanism for Just Transition” was therefore approved, which consists of an initiative to ensure that the energy transition is carried out in a socially equitable and inclusive manner, taking into account the rights and means of subsistence of workers, people of African descent, indigenous peoples and vulnerable communities. It is as if it was trying to compensate for the fact that the interests of the fossil fuel industry were practically not touched.
Although the need to abandon fossil fuels was not mentioned in the final text, André Corrêa do Lago (Secretary of Climate, Energy and Environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), as president of COP30, in his final address, and to appease the disappointment of many of the participants, committed to creating two roadmaps: one to “stop and reverse deforestation and the other for the transition from fossil fuels in a fair, orderly and equitable way”.
Some important steps have been taken in the fight against climate change, but the absence of the leaders of the three largest greenhouse gas emitting countries (China, USA and India) does not allow us to conclude that the COP30 recommendations will be fully fulfilled. It was not an absolute success, but we should also not be so pessimistic as to say that it was a failure.

The first effects of the crisis are visible. Emblematic is the impasse of the “Future Combat Air System (FCAS)”, a program started in 2018 to build a sixth generation jet, today on the verge of collapse. According to the newspaper Welt, the French government had demanded control of 80 percent of the project, a hypothesis considered absolutely unacceptable in Germany, to the point of leading the Ministry of Defense to consider its definitive cancellation and to show growing interest in the “Global Combat Air Programme”, developed by “BAE Systems and Leonardo” in cooperation with Mitsubishi. The fact that our Europe's original engine shows signs of failure says a lot about the true substance of European rearmament. The “ReArm Europe” plan, presented with pomp by the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, runs the risk of accentuating the inconsistencies between the continent's defense systems, as, in practice, only States with ample fiscal margin will be able to reinforce their military apparatus. European countries are rearming, but they do so unevenly and to satisfy distinctly national priorities, sometimes in conflict with each other.
The German case is exemplary. In response to Paris' requests, Berlin was very clear in excluding the hypothesis of a common European debt to finance defense industries. And last March, even before formalizing the new “Große Koalition”, the Bundestag approved a monumental plan that lifts the debt brake for all military expenditure exceeding 1 percent of GDP. An unprecedented measure, which for the first time opens up the prospect of potentially unlimited rearmament. According to the most prudent estimates, Germany will have to undertake a significant annual financial effort over the next decade, representing a relevant share of its GDP. To understand the scale of the Federal Republic's ambition, it is enough to look at the list of expenses planned by officials in Berlin, which lasts for several decades and also includes part of the special fund announced by Chancellor Scholz. Among the most relevant areas are investment in ammunition, combat vehicles, naval vessels and equipment, aircraft and missiles, as well as logistical and field resources, other types of vehicles, telecommunications systems and satellite communications. Peak spending is expected between 2029 and 2030, with more than 52 billion euros per year on military equipment alone.
Merz is right in stating that the Federal Republic is preparing to become the “most powerful conventional army” on the Old Continent. Less well-founded is the idea that this might automatically serve an undefined European cause. This is not about fueling useless alarmism as we are not facing the return of German militarism as we studied it in history textbooks, nor does the Berlin ruling class aspire to conquer a “place in the sun” inspired by Wilhelmina. In fact, if the occasion demands it, it is quite likely that Germany will use its military instrument in cooperation with other European countries. But it is worth remembering that the extent of this commitment will ultimately be determined exclusively by a calculation of German interests. German rearmament is there for all to see. Less clear is what Berlin's plans really are. Western pressures were important, but they are not sufficient, in themselves, to explain a phenomenon of this magnitude. You need to go deeper.
There is, first of all, an economic calculation. Among the Berlin ruling class, there is a widespread conviction that rearmament can breathe new life into an industrial system in deep crisis, particularly the automobile sector. The assumption is that, in recent years, all the pillars of German prosperity have crumbled. And, unlike other Western countries, the Federal Republic is an industrial power and wants to continue to be so, as it is precisely the ability to export products with high added value that supports full employment and the welfare state. This is why, in Berlin, “reconversion” is being discussed, that is, transforming a considerable part of civilian manufacturing for military purposes, a prospect that especially attracts the defense giant Rheinmetall, desperately looking for highly qualified workers.
However, it is highly unlikely that military production, even taken to the extreme, will be able to solve all of Germany's problems. There is, however, a deeper dimension. The large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine did not create German rearmament, but only accelerated it until it became irreversible. In fact, the idea that Germany should once again consider using its military instrument had been cultivated in Berlin strategic circles for more than a decade. In May 2010, Federal President Horst Köhler stated, in a radio interview, that the Germans should prepare themselves “to use force in defense of their interests”. These words caused such a scandal that they forced him to resign. But Köhler did nothing more than make public, perhaps with excessive frankness, what was being discussed behind the scenes.
It was no coincidence that, just two years later, two of Berlin's most influential think tanks the “Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik” and the “German Marshall Fund” launched the project “New Power, New Responsibility: Elements of a German foreign and security policy for a changing world” in October 2013. The final report, with more than 50 pages, was perfectly aligned with Köhler's vision that “German citizens lived in an era of unprecedented security. But traditional threats such as war, nuclear proliferation and terrorism continue to exist. Germany is existentially dependent on exchange with other societies, and the vulnerability of neighbors and allies also affects its own security. Its protection is therefore in its interests, when and where necessary.”
Participants included security experts, representatives of the arms industry, officials from the Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs, and members of the Bundestag. This is why, between 2016 and 2018, the Bundeswehr formally changed its main mission, moving from global crisis management to territorial defense. This revolution remained for years only on paper, but in practice it made possible the rearmament announced by Scholz in 2022. In a sense, the speech about the Zeitenwende (historical turning point) had been ready for a long time and was just waiting to be pronounced. The turning point concerned urgency, not the concept. In three years, a minority idea became common sense, a result that is mainly due to the initiative of the ruling class, committed to a total effort to reintroduce a military ethos into the fabric of civil society.
The real revolution is taking place in the mind of the average German, for whom war is no longer unthinkable. Voices calling for peace without weapons, once dominant, have been progressively excluded from public debate. Emblematic is the case of the book by young journalist Ole Nymoen, “Warum ich niemals für mein Land kämpfen würde (Why I would never fight for my country)” published on March 11, 2025. At the time of publication it caused controversy, but its theses were never truly taken seriously. In the Bundestag, only Die Linke remains openly pacifist, while the AfD and traditional parties find an unprecedented point of agreement.
Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, currently the most popular politician in the country, does not miss an opportunity to assert that the Bundeswehr must once again be "capable of fighting" (kriegstüchtig) and has not ruled out a war between NATO and Russia by 2029. And the population follows, as more than two thirds of Germans say they support doubling defense spending by 2032. We are at the center of a decade that, in all probability, will lead to the end of the complex of historical guilt that has weighed on Germans for the last eighty years.
The past will not be erased or forgotten, but it will gradually stop limiting Berlin's room for maneuver. Thus ends, in part, what the British historian Alec Ryrie defined as the “era of Hitler”, that is, the long post-war period in which Adolf Hitler was “the most powerful and unifying figure”, erected as an absolute negative in the moral canon of nations and individuals. A new Germany is emerging on the horizon, and its contours remain largely undefined. The only certainty is that it will transform Europe.</description><pubDate>2025-12-04 03:36:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Lessons from the Hong Kong tragedy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/02/licoes-da-tragedia-de-hong-kong/</link><description>The devastating fire at Hung Fook Court in Tai Po, Hong Kong, broke out in seven or eight buildings. Maintenance work was taking place in these buildings and the contractors used highly flammable expansive foam to seal windows and the scaffolding used was made of bamboo, which allowed the fire to spread quickly after it started in one of the buildings. Strong winds and dry weather caused the flames to intensify, which subsequently affected the entire housing block. The fire alarms did not go off, contributing to the tragedy.
Around 48 hours after the accident, the Hong Kong Government had practically extinguished the fire. With the help of the Central Government, which sent substantial resources to Hong Kong, and numerous companies that donated money and supplies, the needs were met, allowing the victims to have temporary respite.
At the time of writing this article, the Hong Kong Government has just announced that there have been 146 deaths, 79 injured and 40 missing. Among the dead is a heroic firefighter who died fighting the flames. Before we continue our analysis, let us observe a minute of silence for those who lost their lives and pray for the survivors, hoping that they can soon overcome their difficulties. We also express our highest respect to all the workers and volunteers who participated in the rescue operations, praising their courage and dedication in the face of adversity.
In addition to caring for the victims, the Hong Kong Government also quickly sought to identify those responsible for the accident. For example, the person responsible for maintaining the Hung Fook Court was arrested and is suspected of involuntary manslaughter. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) also ordered the arrest of individuals suspected of corruption. The Hong Kong Government immediately carried out surprise inspections of all protective nets used in building maintenance to ensure they met fire safety standards.
The insurers working with the building maintenance companies also publicly stated that they had activated emergency mechanisms and would provide adequate compensation in accordance with the contracts concluded. In Hong Kong, some people suggested that maintenance companies should use metal scaffolding instead of bamboo scaffolding in the future.
How will the victims deal with the consequences of this disaster? Firstly, the injured must receive immediate treatment. Secondly, they should immediately contact the families to let them know they are safe. We saw many people on television worried about their families, crying and waiting for news. Sending them a message to reassure them is essential. Thirdly, they will have to solve the accommodation problem. If they have another place to live or if they can stay with family or friends, they will need to continue these steps. It is not known when they will be able to return home. If they have no solution, they will have to join the Hong Kong Government's temporary accommodation program. Fourth, assuming the government inspection finds the house is still habitable, should the owners renovate it? Hung Fook Court opened in 1983, more than 40 years ago, and repair work had already begun. This devastating fire accelerated the devaluation of the property. Homeowners should consider whether it is worth making large investments in renovation, given the future value of the homes and the likelihood of them being sold successfully.
In addition to the different reactions of the Hong Kong Government, the public and the victims, this devastating accident has, in fact, raised other issues that concern society.
First, Hong Kong is by nature a city with a high cost of living. A worker who manages to buy a house with the salary he earns during his working life achieves a significant feat. After two or three decades of paying the mortgage, the building has become worn out and needs major work. At that point, owners need to make large investments in maintenance, making the house and the problems it raises seem like a bottomless pit, a black hole impossible to fill. The relationship between homeowners and their homes is reminiscent of the title of a television series – “property slaves.”
Second, following this rare accident, contractors will be more careful about the materials they use. Insurers will also be more careful when entering into contracts with maintenance companies and will impose more stringent requirements. This means that insurance premiums may increase. Homeowners who purchased home and fire insurance may also see their premiums change. All of these factors will fall on home owners, meaning they will bear more expenses. For owners who are still working, this situation is compounded by additional charges. What about retired owners? They may have set up a fund for maintenance before retirement, but with their financial situation after retirement, they may no longer be able to cover these expenses.
This should be an issue for all homeowners who were not directly affected by the fire and potential homebuyers to consider. Although properties in Hong Kong are valuable, they also give rise to many problems. This devastating accident brought new perspectives to the Hong Kong Government, society, victims and potential homebuyers. Let us hope that these new ideas benefit Hong Kong society and prevent similar tragedies.

A military coup had ended a political dictatorship of more than 40 years. The military of the Armed Forces Movement (MFA) had managed to overthrow an oppressive regime that spent years arresting and deporting those who defended freedom, democracy, socialism and communism. The times following the military coup were turbulent because we soon realized that these soldiers also had their political options and were also beginning to play into the hands of this or that political party. Mário Soares and Álvaro Cunhal returned from exile and on the first May 1st the party was thunderous and with a popular union never seen before. As time went by, we saw that the divergences between the MFA military, supported by certain parties, bordered on radicalism.
On September 28, 1974, we witnessed an attempted coup d'état carried out by conservative sectors, led by the President of the Republic, General António de Spínola and where the so-called “silent majority” prevailed at the time, which aimed to halt the democratic process, but, essentially, control decisions on decolonization. The left-wing sector of the MFA managed to ban a demonstration in support of Spínola and we remember that barricades were placed at the entrances to Lisbon in order to prevent the entry of Spínola's supporters. As a result, several organizers of the demonstration were arrested, General Spínola resigned as President of the Republic and the event marked the defeat of the attempt to turn to the right and the strengthening of the MFA's control over the revolutionary process. First important note: never in more than 50 years of democracy have left-wing democrats celebrated the victory of September 28, 1974.
On March 11, 1975, we personally witnessed another attempted coup d'état, this time, commanded by General António de Spínola against the government of the time supported by the left-wing MFA military. The attempt began with the bombing of the Light Artillery Regiment No. 1 (RAL 1) and a soldier who was lying in one of the barracks was killed. The RTP archives must contain images of the piercing of the roof and the blood on the bed and floor of the barracks. RAL 1 was surrounded by paratroopers, assigned to Spínola, and negotiations lasted almost the entire day. The attempt would fail due to the lack of popular support for Spínola and due to the resistance that was registered by the RAL 1 military and many people. The failure of the coup attempt would lead to Spínola's flight to Spain and then to Brazil. Second important note: left-wing democrats in more than 50 years of democracy have never celebrated victory over the attempt to interrupt the revolutionary process.
The summer that followed was very “hot” with several disputes within the MFA and with right-wing parties intensifying their confrontation with the Communist Party and other radical left parties. Everything would end on November 25, 1975.
On that day, the left-wing MFA military occupied RTP and Captain Duran Clemente, while speaking directly at the public television studios, was interrupted from one moment to the next and the broadcast began to be directed from the studios in Porto. Simultaneously at the Military Police barracks, the soldiers on duty there commanded by Major Tomé found themselves confronted by military commandos from the right wing of the MFA, commanded by Captain Jaime Neves and Major Ramalho Eanes. The shooting was a reality. Two military commandos and others from the Military Police died. At the Belém Palace, where the President of the Republic, General Costa Gomes, resided, calls were made for the arrest of the 25th of April strategist, Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, and the illegalization of the Communist Party. At the end of the afternoon, with the Commando troops controlling all operations in their favor, an MFA meeting was held where the moderate wing, led by Major Melo Antunes, managed to ensure that Otelo was not arrested and that the Communist Party remained a legal party at the service of democracy. The 25th of November, a political dispute, but essentially between military personnel, was immediately announced as a “heroic” restoration of the democratic state. Third important note: never in more than 50 years of democracy have right-wing political forces remembered to officially celebrate November 25, 1975.
Last week, we found that the 25th of November was officially celebrated with pomp and circumstance and, obviously, with the support of right-wing and extreme-right political forces, with the disagreement of the Socialist Party and other left-wing political parties and, aggravatingly, the date was celebrated in the Assembly of the Republic with the presence of President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.
The truth is that we witnessed the positions of individuals defending fascist and neo-Nazi policies, stating that the celebrations of November 25th “were much more important than those of April 25th”. We no longer have any doubts that the political system in Portugal is changing. A dangerous change. A change in which racists, xenophobes and neo-Nazis advance proposals in Parliament that receive the support of the elected Montenegro Government, which announces itself as democratic. No, my friends. We must realize that the political change we are witnessing could end in a dictatorship disguised as democracy, where prisons and a lack of press freedom will be a reality.</description><pubDate>2025-12-01 02:06:59</pubDate></item><item><title>AMAGAO | “Meet You There” features works by Alexandre Marreiros and Nyoman Suarnata</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/amagao-meet-you-there-apresenta-obras-de-alexandre-marreiros-e-nyoman-suarnata/</link><description>Architect and artist Alexandre Marreiros is back at exhibitions, but this time he is not alone. In “Meet You There”, opened today at the AMAGAO gallery, Marreiros joins his friend Nyoman Suarnata for an exhibition that reflects “territories of adjustable perception”, with concepts shaped by “collaboration, dialogue and imagination”
The AMAGAO gallery, a project by Lina Ramadas and Vítor Hugo Marreiros, hosts a new exhibition today. “Meet You There” begins to receive its first visitors at 6:30 pm, featuring works by two artists who decided to join forces: Alexandre Marreiros, who usually wanders between arts and architecture, and Nyoman Suarnata.
In the curatorial text about this exhibition, it is stated that “Meet You There” is not just “a point on the map”, but rather “a conceptual territory shaped by collaboration, dialogue and imagination”, where the two artists “transform canvas and paper into a shared space where perception is fluid and the narrative pulses like a living organism”.
This “creative encounter” brings a new “place where visual language becomes an instrument of investigation”, with works with “overlapping compositions, fragmented symbols and constantly shifting perspectives”, where “artists build a territory that resists fixed meaning”.
And what elements live in this new territory full of concepts and conceptions? “Social, personal and environmental concerns”, which then “metamorphose into characters, symbols and even superheroes”. "These are not figures that save, but that reveal. They are incarnations of urgency, empathy and resistance, challenging the viewer to reflect: what does it mean to care? Imagine? Act?", the same text asks.
This exhibition invites you “to participate in a space where art is not static, but generative; where dialogue is not linear, but stratified; and where imagination is a form of engagement and participation”.
Studio work
Speaking to HM about the exhibition, Alexandre Marreiros talks about an exhibition created by two friends, with much of the work carried out in Macau, together, in a permanent collaboration. This was due to “several trips that Nyoman made to Macau, namely to my studio, where he was free to choose any of my works”.
"There was always an interesting construction, a long process, first for Nyoman to free himself and choose a work of mine without limitations. After a day of work I responded to his interventions. At first it was a curious thing, because he had great respect and almost didn't touch the parts he had already painted and I didn't touch his things either, but we felt that there was a kind of limit, something we didn't want. There was a very interesting exercise in liberation, in which I opened the doors of my studio, I gave him the works that He had to be able to choose and intervene in them, and then I would respond.”
Thus, 34 works emerged in around two years of joint work, in which the artistic skills of both came into contact. "If we look back, we see that I always have a graphic resource and also the word in my works. Nyoman also has that register, something perhaps more handwritten, and I had other techniques, be it screen printing, lithography or drawing, I used them a lot to transport the word to my works."
Alexandre Marreiros assumes that “in some way, there is always a character” in his works, namely “poets and philosophers”, more specifically “there is always a predominant character in my work, which is Luís de Camões”; while Nyoman “has a universe of characters that can be assimilated, or not, in a critical way, or that can be considered superheroes or a human being with supernatural powers”.
“Meet You There” is, therefore, the result of a permanent collaboration, in which one artist worked on the other’s works in their absence, in which there were “few opportunities, perhaps 10 or 20 percent, in which we could both participate directly in the work”.
“It's something you feel in the work, which is honest, in the sense that there is a universe of communion, universality and trust, of two very different people who meet, respect and admire each other”, said Marreiros.
Contemporary themes
In these works there is satire “of the times in which we live”, namely “in a series of works, the first, and which are very much the representation of what Nyoman sees in Macau”. There is then another series “with his superheroes and mine, which are always the writers, philosophers and human beings who, in some way, left their mark on this passage that is life”.
There are also other works “a little more linked to Macau, namely to the world of casinos”. “I actively and directly participate in this Macau identity and industry and, therefore, it is natural that this universe appears in my work and there are interventions and reinterpretations by Nyoman.”
Macau has always been, for the two artists, “a meeting and work point”, with this project being “a liberation” for Alexandre Marreiros, in the sense that he opened the door of his studio to Nyoman's interventions.
It is “an exhibition that talks about globalization, relationships of trust, cultural, artistic and intellectual differences that can coexist in the same territory”. There are satirical messages “that reveal some concerns of the two artists in the context in which they live and in the context in which they operate globally”. “Meet You There” is, for Alexandre Marreiros, “an exposure of our time and context, and revealing that differences can coexist and create beautiful dialogues and narratives, which are also different”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:45:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Festival of short films and animations to see in the Capitol</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/04/festival-de-curtas-e-animacoes-para-ver-no-capitolio/</link><description>Another edition of the Macau International Short Film Festival has been taking place since Tuesday, promoted by Creative Macau. The sessions take place daily at the Capitol Theater, in the center of Macau, and the awards for the best films, in different categories, will be awarded on the 12th of this month.

This is “No Limiar da Memória”, by Mariana Maia Rocha, a project with ingredients from Macau’s memory and architecture, including bamboo construction, in which the artist presents herself as a “diasporic observer”.
It is called “On the Threshold of Memory” and presents itself as an “exhibition that confronts the architecture of transience in the material and spiritual landscape of Macau”. This new exhibition, which will open next Monday, the 8th, at Albergue da Santa Casa da Misericórdia (SCM), starting at 6:30 pm, is the result of a resident project by Mariana Maia Rocha, a Portuguese artist.
According to a note from Albergue SCM, Mariana uses here “her position as a diasporic observer and the experience of an immersive residence in Asian territory to investigate the paradoxical status of bamboo”, as a “pillar of local vernacular construction”. This is in the sense that bamboo “transitions from the utilitarian and profane to the domain of cultural heritage and the sacred, given its imminent replacement by iron and concrete”.
Also according to the same note, this exhibition is relevant for “its critical analysis of accelerated urban transformations and the impact of globalization on local identity, a scenario of particular resonance in Macau”. Thus, it becomes a “juxtaposition of symbolic materialities that underline the Portuguese-Chinese duality”, in which dust, transfigured into coal, graphite and ash of local origin, “functions as the ‘index’ of mortality, the fundamental substance of the universal ‘memento mori’”.
In turn, “votive wax, common to Taoist and Catholic rituals, is used to mold ex-votos from the artist's shoes, configuring a procedural line that metaphorizes the personal journey and the vulnerability of the body”. Mariana Maia Rocha also presents, in this project, an “ephemeral urban intervention with latex recording the texture of the Portuguese sidewalk”.
“This tactile “second skin” “works as a memory device, alluding to the scaffolding protection networks and the disappearing Portuguese legacy, creating a physical record of the cultural border and the negotiation of urban space”, he explains.
Dialogues and contexts
Taking into account the artist's readings on these elements so linked to Macau's identity, “No Limiar da Memória” can be described as an attempt to create “a powerful dialogue about memory, mortality and the ephemeral structures that we build”.
Here, “the artist’s practice navigates the tension between the permanent and the fleeting, cultural identity and the inevitability of disintegration in a territory of convergence and loss, echoing the complexities of a rapidly changing place.”
Mariana Maia Rocha is a visual artist and researcher whose interdisciplinary practice is part of the intersection between the body, memory and territory. His work, which predominantly integrates drawing, photoperformance and installation, addresses the conceptual and material boundaries of presence and erasure in the contemporary archive.
The artist graduated from the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Porto, where she completed her master's degree in Fine Arts, receiving a scholarship from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, namely in 2023/2024, when she won the “Gulbenkian New Talents” scholarship. Still in the academic area, this year he won a doctoral scholarship to continue studies abroad.
In 2023, the artist participated in the “Mirror Identity Drawings” (MIDD) project, signed by the UNESCO Charter. The international dimension of his practice has materialized, this year, through a program of artistic residencies, in São Tomé and Príncipe, in the context of the XI Bienal de São Tomé; and now in Macau, within the scope of the international program “Territories without Borders” (2025–2026), promoted by the Fundação Bienal de Arte de Cerveira.
Since 2018, his work has been presented in solo and collective exhibitions at leading institutions, including the Museu Nacional de Arte Contemporânea do Chiado (MNAC) (Lisbon), Fundação Júlio Resende (Porto), Palácio Vila Flor (Guimarães) and Galeria Kubik (Porto), among others. He has already received dozens of distinctions for his work.</description><pubDate>2025-12-04 03:24:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Book | “Receita di Casa” by Antonieta Manhão awarded in Saudi Arabia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/livro-receita-di-casa-de-antonieta-manhao-premiado-na-arabia-saudita/</link><description>Macanese chef Antonieta Manhão, better known as “Chef Neta”, has just seen her work honored with two awards in Saudi Arabia.

The second most used means of movement in the city is once again the public bus, despite a drop of one percentage point to 20.9 percent last year.
Regarding the use of private passenger cars, DSAT reported a slight increase of 0.8 percent between 2024 and 2019, for a total of 15.5 percent. The percentage varies greatly depending on the area of ​​residence, with Coloane, naturally, being the most suitable area for traveling by car or motorcycle.

The IAM says that autopsies revealed systemic hemorrhagic lesions and that death from poisoning is “extremely low”. The case was referred to the police
It happened again. On Wednesday, photographs of dead dogs were published on Facebook. The author, who suspected death by poisoning, says he saw employees from the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) and a company hired by the public entity spreading rat poison in an area, in Coloane, where a dead dog was found.
According to the publication, the internet user approached IAM and cleaning company employees criticizing the method of applying the poison in violation of established guidelines, which would be exposed on the side of the road, within reach of people and domestic animals. In response, the complainant states that he was told that everything was fine, and they continued to deposit the poison despite the citizen's protests.
On Wednesday night, the IAM issued a statement addressing the issue, stating that it had received “successive reports from citizens about the discovery of three dog corpses in three adjacent locations in Coloane”, starting last Saturday. Stating that it is “highly attentive to the incident”, the IAM indicates that it immediately deployed personnel to monitor the cases in the locations in question. "After the autopsy of the corpses and respective analysis, it was found that the three dogs in question had systemic hemorrhagic lesions. The Institute has already reported the case to the police, awaiting further investigation."
Carbon paper
Regarding the suspicion of poison ingestion by dogs, the IAM highlighted that the product currently used “contains a bitter agent, specifically designed for rats due to their lack of vomiting reflex”. "For animals with a vomiting system, including cats and dogs, accidental ingestion causes a vomiting reaction, making swallowing difficult. Therefore, the probability of poisoning through accidental ingestion is extremely low. Furthermore, the dose of bait placed by IAM workers each time is specifically calculated for the small size of rats," added the public entity.
In the Facebook post, the internet user published a photograph where you can see a pile of reddish colored sprinkles.
The institute led by Chao Wai Ieng also indicated that the poison is placed in fixed and locked boxes, or in rat holes, remaining hidden and without easy contact by people or animals. A statement completely contradictory to the report of the internet user who reported the situation.
At the beginning of May, a similar case also occurred in Taipa with three dead dogs and similar suspicions. At the time, the IAM issued a statement similar to the one released on Wednesday night.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:22:16</pubDate></item><item><title>HIV | Association warns of increasing trends</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/vih-associacao-alerta-para-tendencias-de-aumento/</link><description>Kelvin Lei, project supervisor at the Macao AIDS Care Association, warns of the complexity of the greater number of HIV cases in the non-resident population and regrets that the stigma surrounding the virus and the disease is still a reality in the territory
The Macao AIDS Care Association speaks of a scenario of complexity given the growing number of new HIV cases among non-residents. In an interview with HM, Kelvin Lei, the association's project supervisor, describes that “the trend observed among non-residents is complex and reflects structural factors, and not just individual behavior”.
These factors are “Macau’s status as an international hub, which means a constant flow of people, including visitors, immigrant workers and students from around the world”, who “may have different attitudes towards high-risk sexual behavior due to their cultural diversity and academic background”.
For Kelvin Lei, “greater attention to testing and detecting cases among non-residents can lead to more diagnoses”, and “barriers [in access] to services” persist, particularly due to “linguistic differences, limited knowledge of local health rights, concerns about confidentiality or work schedules that conflict with opening hours”.
“The fear of stigma or job loss” still remains, scenarios that can be “a significant impediment to seeking tests or health care”. There are also “socio-economic factors” that explain the growth in cases. Data from the Health Services in November speak of a growing trend in cases: between January and September this year, 28 new cases of HIV infection were registered, 14 of which were among residents and 14 among non-residents. Last year, there was no reference to non-residents being infected.
In comparison, between January and September last year, nine cases had been confirmed among residents, meaning that throughout this year there has been a 55.6 percent increase in new cases detected.
Important role
The conversation with Kelvin Lei arose regarding the holding, this weekend, of the 8th Forum on AIDS in Beijing, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, taking place in Lisbon Macau, in Cotai. In 2016, Macau had organized another edition of this event.
For Kelvin Lei, the repetition of Macau as a host location “has a profound meaning” for the association, as it “reaffirms the active and committed role” of the territory “as a vital bridge in the regional partnership between Beijing, Hong Kong and Taiwan in the fight against HIV/AIDS”.
“Although Macau’s prevalence [of new cases] remains relatively low, we face distinct challenges, including a mobile population and the need for sustained and targeted prevention,” he said.
“The misconception that HIV only affects specific groups, such as men who have sex with men, as is the case globally” also persists in the territory. This is a “harmful idea, because it creates a false sense of security in other populations and worsens stigma”.
Focus on the individual
Regarding stigma, Kelvin Lei draws attention to the fact that, “in compact communities like Macau and Hong Kong”, there is “a fear of social disclosure within close-knit networks”. It is up to the Executive to incorporate another type of discourse into its policies, he suggested.
"We recognize and appreciate the SAR Government's commitment and resource allocation to prevention and treatment, with the clinical infrastructure providing essential antiretroviral therapy. The doctor-patient ratio in this specific area is managed. The discourse has progressively shifted towards a scientific and public health framework. However, the next frontier is to truly integrate the fight against stigma into official discourse and systemic practice."
The supervisor speaks of the need for public defense of the “U=U” concept, that is, “undetectable – non-transmissible”, in addition to the need to “promote person-centered care that looks at the individual, and not just the virus”. Kelvin Lei also advises “promoting the standardization of tests for everyone and guaranteeing non-discriminatory policies in all contexts”.
Therefore, holding the Forum this weekend brings a dialogue “with representatives from all regions, including the Government, which is a positive step towards aligning our scientific capabilities, with the necessary social support, to end the epidemic”.
It is also intended to analyze “innovative strategies, such as long-term prevention and artificial intelligence applications that we are discussing, and a spirit of solidarity”.
The AIDS Care Association in Macau sees itself as “one of the main associations in HIV prevention in Macau”, facing “non-medical challenges”, such as “internalized and social stigma”, which “can lead to profound loneliness and mental health problems”. It is also necessary to “guarantee continuity of care”, with “holistic needs” on the part of patients, such as medication, “psychological counseling, support to reveal the condition to family or employers and, sometimes, nutritional or financial assistance”. This association therefore provides a series of support in this regard.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:20:56</pubDate></item><item><title>Law | Macau lawyers with strengthened powers in the interior</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/04/direito-advogados-de-macau-com-poderes-reforcados-no-interior/</link><description>Since yesterday, lawyers from Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan have been able to represent clients in more types of civil litigation in the Interior, according to an announcement from the Ministry of Justice, cited by the newspaper Ou Mun. The measure only applies to local lawyers recognized by Interior.
With the changes, local lawyers have access to 299 types of civil rights cases, in areas such as trade, maritime disputes, personality rights or industrial rights protection cases. However, the intervention of local lawyers is only authorized if it is done on behalf of parties from Macau, Hong Kong or Taiwan involved in these processes.
The data cited by the publication indicates that there are currently around 760 lawyers from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan who have been granted authorization to work in the Interior. More than 630 lawyers from Hong Kong and Macau also received the certificate to practice in the Greater Bay Area.
Macau lawyers can practice on the other side of the border if they speak the language, have obtained a degree in law in the Interior or if they have a certification recognizing their qualifications.</description><pubDate>2025-12-04 03:22:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Satellite casinos | Initiative promoted to mitigate impact of closure</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/04/casinos-satelite-promovida-iniciativa-para-mitigar-impacto-do-fecho/</link><description>The ZAPE Industrial and Commercial Association of Macau and around 250 businesses invested 3 million patacas in online training to promote this area of ​​the city on social media
Around 250 NAPE and ZAPE businesses joined together in an initiative led by the ZAPE Industrial and Commercial Association of Macau to mitigate the economic impact in the areas of the closure of several satellite casinos. According to Macau Business magazine, the initiative involves an investment of 3 million patacas.
The objective is to transform the area into an attractive place to take photos and post on social media, to bring a new type of tourist to the area and create a more consumer-oriented model. The plan is seen as an alternative path for the economy in that area, after the forced closure of several satellite casinos that thrived in those parts of the city for years.
Also to make commerce in the area more competitive, support was distributed for the development of advertising activities for online and on-site commercial spaces.
Regarding the initiative, Wu Tat Chong, president of the ZAPE Industrial and Commercial Association of Macau, explained that it is motivated “by changes in the market and in people's consumption habits that have caused businesses in ZAPE and NAPE to face new challenges, such as a fluctuating number of customers”. The official also indicated that due to the new reality, “competition has become more intense” which has meant that many businesses in those locations “are fighting for their survival”.
Support from outside
The campaign promoted by the ZAPE Industrial and Commercial Association of Macau also seeks to draw attention to the areas, with online campaigns, then encouraging physical experiences.
In a first phase, participating stores now receive training on how to explore online promotion platforms. Additionally, the campaign allows for subsidy-based promotions and specific marketing schemes to increase companies' visibility.
In addition to participants from the territory, the initiative also involves the involvement of takeaway delivery platforms in Hong Kong. In view of the expected loss of business in those areas, imposed by deputies following a proposal from the Government, the Executive has tried to present actions to take people to those locations.
One of the anticipated events is the organization of a Christmas Festival, organized as a complement to the Iluminar Macau Festival, between December and the beginning of next year.</description><pubDate>2025-12-04 03:21:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Social housing | Man loses apartment for having property in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/04/habitacao-social-homem-perde-apartamento-por-ter-imovel-na-china/</link><description>A candidate for social housing, with two daughters, lost his right to the apartment because he had a property in the interior of China that was not declared, initially, to the Housing Institute (IH). This situation arises in a ruling by the Court of Second Instance (TSI), released yesterday, regarding an appeal presented by the man, when he lost the right to this Government housing.
The case dates back to 2011, when the lease contract with IH was signed, but in 2022, during its review, the man added to the declaration, for the first time, that he owned a property in the country valued at more than 350 thousand renminbi.
The IH therefore understood that the candidate no longer had the conditions to live in a social house, and the refund of the residence allowance received between May and July 2011, in the total value of 4,800 patacas, was also required. The man appealed the decision to the Administrative Court and then to the TSI, but this court understood that “the decision to terminate the contract in order to balance the distribution of resources and avoid harm to private interests is not manifestly unreasonable”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-04 03:19:24</pubDate></item><item><title>ZELENSKY VS ZELENSKY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.

At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke at length and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. He says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no such thing as chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is usually used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in others. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this mistake. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who didn't love anyone./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria stayed with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely outside our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J. Pinto Fernandes emerges at the exact moment when we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but this only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows everyone else and the joy of recognizing that the yardstick of the world is not measured with my short measure and that, on the contrary, it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican for writers from the north, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thought about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché “all different, all equal”, a return to “diplomacy”, given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that “we are unified because we share the same nature” but simply highlights that we “still do not share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that quenches your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and impressive, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unresponsive to reins and containment.
Let men refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish, because of it the tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the pride of the countries will be destroyed.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert”.
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that muzzle, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relationships were restricted, or if it merely lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Obviously, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as a hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the position of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, in a different way, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE
(…)
Helahoho! helahoho!
The poor widow's sewing machine who was bayoneted...
She sewed indefinitely in the afternoon…
The table where the old people played,
Everything mixed, everything mixed with bodies, with blood,
All one river, one wave, one dragging horror.

And I cried like all the mothers in the world about the horror of life.
My pantheistic feet tripped over the sewing machine
[widow who was killed with a bayonet
And that poor instrument of peace stuck a spear in my heart.
Yes, I was the one to blame for everything, I was the soldier for them all
Who killed, raped, burned and broke,
It was me and my shame and my remorse like a shadow
[misshapen
They travel around the world like Ashavero,
But behind my steps there are footsteps the size of infinity
And a physical fear of being accountable to God makes me close my eyes.
[eyes suddenly.

I ordered, captain, to shoot the trembling peasants,
I let the daughters of all fathers tied to trees be raped,
Now I saw that it was inside my heart that all this happened,
And everything scalds and suffocates and I can't move without it
[everything be the same.
God have mercy on me, I didn't have it from anyone!

According to information released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC, central bank) on its official website, the official exchange rate for yesterday was set at 7.0733 yuan per dollar, 164 'pips' (one hundredth of 1 percent, a measure used in exchange rate analyses) below the most widespread forecasts among investors and analysts.
The decision, highlights the Bloomberg agency, represents the biggest difference between market expectations and the rate finally fixed by the BPC since February 2022. The exchange rate fixed by the BPC is fundamental for the quotation of the “onshore” rate — negotiated in national markets — of the yuan, since it can only deviate within a maximum daily range of 2 percent, both when it appreciates and when it depreciates.
Given the optimism that followed the trade truce between China and the United States, followed by the announcement of the possible visit of US President Donald Trump to the Asian country next year, the yuan has been approaching the psychological barrier of 7 units per dollar, and its value in the markets is on track to reach the highest levels since 2020.
Part of the appreciation of the yuan in relation to the dollar is also due to fears, reflected in the US currency, regarding the budgetary policy of the United States, as well as forecasts of a reduction in interest rates by the Federal Reserve (Fed).
"The PBOC has been prioritizing exchange rate stability, so it is not surprising (…) that they are slowing down the pace of increases. We do not expect the level of 7 units [per dollar] to be put to the test for the rest of the year, but it will probably be surpassed at some point next year", said Lynn Song, ING's chief economist for China, cited by Bloomberg.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:57:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan bond yields rise to highest level since 2007</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/rendimento-dos-titulos-da-divida-do-japao-sobe-para-nivel-mais-alto-desde-2007/</link><description>The yield on Japanese 10-year debt reached 1.91 percent yesterday, the highest level since July 2007, due to expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will raise interest rates.
Japan's central bank governor, Kazuo Ueda, sparked speculation on Monday about a possible rate hike, when he suggested in a speech before business leaders that economic conditions are ripe for continuing with the normalization of monetary policy, which the organization suspended in January to assess the impact of new United States tariffs.
Without anticipating the outcome of the BoJ's next monetary policy meeting in the middle of this month, Ueda said that “appropriately adjusting the level of monetary easing, neither too late nor too early, is necessary to smoothly achieve the objective of price stability, while ensuring the stability of financial and capital markets.”
The words caused sharp falls on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and debt securities, which had already reached highs since the 2008 financial crisis due to concerns about the archipelago's fiscal health, soared.
They also happened after the announcement by the new Japanese Executive of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, last Thursday, of the project for the expected supplementary budget for 2025, valued at 18.3 billion yen (more than 100 billion euros), which will be financed largely with the issuance of State bonds, and intended above all for an ambitious stimulus package.
Central precautions
The BoJ is, by far, the largest investor in bonds of the most indebted country among the most advanced economies, whose yield is the barometer par excellence of long-term rates.
The central bank has kept benchmark interest rates at 0.5 percent for the past six monetary policy meetings, since a 25 basis point increase in January.
The last meeting of the year generated great expectations, after the change of government in Japan, in October, but the BoJ maintained a cautious stance, before knowing the financial position of the new prime minister – who was critical in relation to the rise in interest rates – and also taking a stabilized view on tariff negotiations with the United States, Japan's second largest trading partner, after China.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:51:19</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korea | Seoul tries to repatriate six citizens detained in the North</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/coreia-do-sul-seul-tenta-repatriar-seis-cidadaos-detidos-no-norte/</link><description>South Korean authorities are trying to return to dialogue with Kim-jong Un's regime in an attempt to rescue six citizens accused of espionage
The South Korean government yesterday committed to seeking the repatriation of six citizens detained on espionage and other charges in North Korea between 2013 and 2016, even though Pyongyang refuses dialogue with Seoul.
“We will resolve the problem by striving to quickly resume inter-Korean dialogue based on national consensus,” stated the presidential office, in a response that was pending on Wednesday at a press conference by South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, in which the head of state acknowledged that he was not aware of the matter.
The six citizens include three North Koreans who defected to South Korea. The other three are missionaries detained by North Korean authorities between 2013 and 2014, namely Kim Jung-wook, Kim Kook-kie and Choi Chun-gil. The presidential office did not reveal the identity of the three North Korean defectors to protect the safety of their families in the North and prevent them from suffering sanctions by association, normally applied by Pyongyang.
“As inter-Korean talks and exchanges have been suspended for a long time, the suffering of our people continues and the issue needs to be resolved urgently,” adds the statement, cited by The Korea Herald. Seoul requested the release of the missionaries in March, still under the rule of the previous South Korean Government, at the request of the Ministry of Unification, after a United Nations working group classified the detentions as illegal.
Old conversations
The last time the issue of detained South Koreans was openly discussed between the two parties was during the 2018 inter-Korean summit between then-South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and in the high-level talks held in the same year.
“As a result, a point was very close to the release [of the detainees]. Kim Jong-un even promised the then President Moon: “I will do everything in my power to [the release of the detainees]”, recalled yesterday deputy Yoon Geon-young, who at the time was director of the South Korean presidential Situation Room.
Kim explained that, after the failed Hanoi summit between Pyongyang and Washington in 2019, and the Covid-19 pandemic, inter-Korean relations deteriorated, “so it was not possible to obtain a result”.
“The reason why we could not publicly inform citizens about this situation at that time was simple: in matters such as the release of detainees, if the process is made public, it could negatively affect the outcome, depending on the case,” he added.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:50:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Middle East | Beijing calls for effective ceasefire in Gaza after new Israeli attack</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/medio-oriente-pequim-pede-cessar-fogo-efectivo-em-gaza-apos-novo-ataque-israelita/</link><description>The Chinese government yesterday called for the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip to come into effect “effectively”, after a new attack by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) left five dead, including two children and two women.
The spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lin Jian, lamented what happened in a refugee camp in Khan Yunis (south of the Palestinian enclave), commenting that “the situation in Gaza remains fragile”. Lin stressed the importance of the ceasefire “to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and restore peace and regional stability as quickly as possible”.
The IDF announced that it carried out the bombing in question in retaliation for the attack against its troops in the Rafah region, in which five Israeli soldiers were injured. For the Palestinian radical Islamist group Hamas, the attack “constitutes a clear war crime” and a “violation of the ceasefire agreement”.
Chinese President Xi Jinping declared yesterday, after meeting in Beijing with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, that both countries will work together towards “a comprehensive, fair and lasting solution” in the Middle East, adding support of 100 million dollars for the reconstruction of Gaza.
Yesterday's Israeli bombing, which took place near the Kuwaiti field hospital, also injured 30 Palestinians, with many of those living in the tents being hospital employees and their families, although it is not yet known whether they are among the victims, the same sources informed the Spanish news agency EFE.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:47:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Visit | Ukraine and trade dominate meeting between Macron and Xi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/visita-ucrania-e-comercio-dominam-encontro-entre-macron-e-xi/</link><description>On his fourth visit to China, Macron once again calls for Beijing's interference in the war in Ukraine, while seeking greater balance in the trade balance between the two countries
French President Emmanuel Macron yesterday appealed to the efforts of his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to end the war in Ukraine and correct trade imbalances, at the start of a state visit to China.
"We must continue to mobilize for peace and stability in the world. And from Ukraine to the different regions of the world affected by war, our ability to work together is decisive", said Macron after a restricted meeting with the Chinese head of state and before discussions in an extended format.
“We know that we have many points in common, sometimes we have disagreements, but we have a responsibility to know how to overcome them, to find mechanisms for cooperation and dispute resolution for an effective multilateralism in which we believe,” added the French leader.
Xi assured, for his part, that China intends to cooperate with France to “eliminate any interference” and “make the overall strategic partnership between China and France more stable”. Macron also called for the growth of “cross-investments” between the two countries, to rebalance the commercial relationship, and defended cooperation within the G7 towards economic governance based on “rules”.
The Chinese President, accompanied by his wife, Peng Liyuan, received Macron and his wife, Brigitte, at the People's Palace, where the two leaders listened to the national anthems and reviewed the troops, before being greeted by children.
The French head of state, who arrived in Beijing on Wednesday night, accompanied by 35 leaders of large business groups (including Airbus, EDF and Danone) and family companies, from the luxury to the agri-food sector, is expected to attend the signing of a series of contracts.
The relationship between China and the European Union is characterized by a huge trade deficit ($357.1 billion) to the detriment of the EU. Paris is also committed to pressuring China to invest more in France, and accept a sharing of technologies comparable to that practiced by Europeans, which has contributed to Beijing's economic growth.
Metals and bears
Another sensitive issue is access to rare metals, whose global production and transformation is dominated by China, a lever that Beijing used in 2025, in the midst of a trade war with the United States, shaking up the planet's supply chains.
This is Emmanuel Macron's fourth state visit to China since being elected President in 2017. Xi Jinping was welcomed to France in 2024 and the Elysee presents the time Xi will spend with Macron until Friday, including private meetings, as a sign of the importance of the Sino-French relationship.
“We have a constant expectation regarding China: It is that it will use its influence with Russia to get it to stop the war” in Ukraine, at the gates of the European Union, says Eliseu.
China has reiterated that it wants peace, but has never condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A fundamental economic and political partner of Russia, the Asian giant is the world's largest buyer of Russian fossil fuels, including petroleum products, thus fueling the war machine. Europeans also accuse Beijing of supplying military components to Moscow.
During his previous trip to Beijing, in 2023, Macron called on Xi to “call Russia to reason”. As in France in 2024, the two presidential couples will meet on Friday in a more informal setting in Chengdu, in the province of Sichuan (southwest), birthplace of the giant pandas that have become China's ambassadors around the world.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:46:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Malaysia | Search resumes for plane missing 11 years ago</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/04/malasia-retomadas-buscas-por-aviao-desaparecido-ha-11-anos/</link><description>Malaysia yesterday announced the resumption of the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared with 239 people on board in March 2014, shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing.
“[Company] Ocean Infinity and the Government of Malaysia confirm that they will begin [on December 30] search operations for a total of 55 days, intermittently”, announced the Malaysian Ministry of Transport, through a statement dated yesterday.
Ocean Infinity is a robotics and deep-sea exploration company based in the United States and the United Kingdom, which has been collaborating for years in the search for the plane, which disappeared on March 8, 2014, around 40 minutes after taking off from Kuala Lumpur en route to the Chinese capital.
The aircraft disappeared from radars after leaving Malaysian airspace and entering Vietnam, when, in principle, it deviated from the route to the south of the Indian Ocean, without the causes yet being known.
Aboard the Boeing 777 were 153 Chinese, 50 Malaysians (12 were part of the crew), seven Indonesians, six Australians, five Indians, four French, three North Americans, two New Zealanders, two Ukrainians, two Canadians, two Iranians, one Russian, one Dutchman and one Taiwanese.
Initially, Malaysia, China and Australia carried out a joint search of around 120,000 square kilometers in the Indian Ocean, but ended operations in January 2017, without finding the plane's wreckage.
Ocean Infinity also tried to locate the device in an area of ​​around 100,000 square kilometers between January and June 2018, without success. Last April, the Malaysian Government stated that the search operation for the aircraft had been interrupted because it was “not the ideal time” for that purpose, but said that it would be resumed at the end of this year. Yesterday's statement states that the search will be carried out in a “specific area with the highest probability of locating the aircraft”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-04 03:41:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Indonesia | Death toll from floods exceeds 800</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/04/indonesia-numero-de-mortos-nas-cheias-ultrapassa-800/</link><description>The death toll caused by the floods that hit the large island of Sumatra, in Indonesia, exceeded 800, the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) announced yesterday.
Authorities previously indicated that 631 people had died. According to BNPB, the latest toll is 804 dead, more than 650 people missing and hundreds of thousands of residents evacuated from their homes on the island of Sumatra, in western Indonesia.
Despite more than 800 deaths, thousands of injuries and massive destruction in Sumatra, the Indonesian government is resisting growing pressure to declare a state of emergency following the floods. The country only took this measure three times, according to available records: during the 1992 earthquake and tsunami, the 2004 tsunami that killed tens of thousands of people and during the covid-19 pandemic.
Calls are growing for the Government to declare a state of emergency, with supporters arguing that such a measure would free up resources and improve the coordination of humanitarian aid. The government of Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has so far insisted that the country has the necessary resources to deal with the situation.
This situation contrasts with that in Sri Lanka where a state of emergency was declared and help was requested from the international community to deal with the effects of the floods.  Amnesty International (AI) Indonesia believes the decision to declare a state of emergency is urgently needed “so that national and international forces can be mobilized to help the victims”.
Authorities warned that the destruction caused by the rains was due to the large amount of water that fell over a prolonged period, causing rivers to overflow.</description><pubDate>2025-12-04 03:40:04</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korea | Seoul considers it “extremely difficult” to manufacture nuclear submarines in the US</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/04/coreia-do-sul-seul-considera-extremamente-dificil-fabricar-submarinos-nucleares-nos-eua/</link><description>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung declared yesterday that it will be “extremely difficult” to manufacture nuclear-powered submarines in the United States.
“From our point of view, producing them there is extremely difficult, to be realistic,” said the head of state, at a press conference. Seoul and Washington finalized an agreement in November on the construction of this type of submarine for the South Korean navy, but the construction site has not been determined.
A joint note detailed that the two countries committed to “continuing collaboration in the field of shipbuilding through a specific working group”.
In October, after having given “yes” to an agreement in principle for the manufacture of a nuclear-powered submarine for the South Korean ally, North American President Donald Trump wrote on the social network X and on Truth Social, which he owns, that it would be built in Philadelphia, in the United States. Yesterday, the South Korean President indicated that the issue “still requires discussion”. Lee Jae-myung stressed that Seoul's position has always been to produce the submarines domestically.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Thailand lifts afternoon alcohol sales ban in place since 1972</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/04/tailandia-levanta-proibicao-de-venda-de-alcool-a-tarde-em-vigor-desde-1972/</link><description>Thailand yesterday lifted a ban on the sale of alcoholic beverages during the afternoon, which was enacted in 1972 to prevent public servants from consuming alcohol during work hours.
The measure now revoked by a royal decree prevented the sale of alcohol between 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm in commercial establishments, such as supermarkets. Sales will be allowed at that time for an initial test period of 180 days, authorities announced yesterday, according to Spanish news agency EFE.
The new regulations extend the previously permitted hours for the sale of alcohol, from 11am to 2pm and from 5pm to midnight, removing the three-hour afternoon ban. The midnight end period remains in effect, but customers in licensed establishments now have a one-hour extension to finish their drinks, according to the Bangkok Post.
Reviewed and confirmed
In February, the Government instructed the Ministries of Health, Internal Administration and Tourism to review the regulations, which also include bans on sales during five special days of the Buddhist calendar per year. The then Minister of Internal Affairs and current Prime Minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, said the policy would be reviewed to stimulate the economy and create jobs.
The authorities confirmed in May their intention to ease restrictions, since then allowing sales during Buddhist festivities in airports, hotels and tourist attraction areas, among other places. The Government already considered the ban to be outdated during Buddhist days, the majority religion in the country, whose fifth precept consists of abstaining from the consumption of toxic products, such as liquors.
Thailand, the most visited country in Southeast Asia, is also taking the measure to boost tourism, with the aim of surpassing the pre-pandemic record of 2019, when it received 39.8 million foreigners. The country has been trying to recover the market, with a special focus on Chinese tourism, the main source of visitors.</description><pubDate>2025-12-04 03:33:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Luís Bernardino, academic: “We need to define a defense cooperation strategy” for the CPLP</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/25/luis-bernardino-academico-precisamos-definir-uma-estrategia-de-cooperacao-defesa-para-a-cplp/</link><description>The book “25 Years of Defense Cooperation at CPLP” was released in 2023 in digital format and, two years later, reached the printed version. Luís Bernardino, co-author linked to the Universidade Autónoma de Lisboa, highlights positive developments since the creation of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, despite inaction and controversies with Equatorial Guinea
“25 Years of Defense Cooperation in the CPLP [Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries]” was released as an e-book and is now available in print. Why edit this book?
This book talks about the 25 years of cooperation in the CPLP defense area and is written by me, together with a colleague from Brazil, Camila Rizzi. It results from a research project developed at the CPLP Strategic Analysis Center, based in Mozambique. It has the CPLP defense component and makes strategic reflection on this topic. Due to the fact that 25 years of cooperation have passed in this area, we wanted to carry out an evaluation and the book so that it would remain in the history of the organization. In 2023, there were no financial conditions to publish the book on paper as we wanted, and it was now launched on November 18th, in Maputo.
There is criticism regarding the effective action of the CPLP. Do you consider that this organism has grown sustainably?
The assessment I make is in the area of ​​defense. When the CPLP was created, cooperation in the area of ​​defense was not included in the initial six areas. This area only emerged in 1998. The CPLP was born with six main areas – culture, language, political-diplomatic concentration – and currently has 26 areas of cooperation, which is proof that it has grown in a sustained manner. Obviously, with ups and downs, situations have become easier over these almost 30 years. But what stands out in this book, in the area of ​​defense, is that there was a very consolidated and participated growth. In these 25 years, a lot of interesting things have been done and the evaluation is positive.
And the future?
We need to define a defense cooperation strategy and what we want for the CPLP in this area over the next 25 years. This is the challenge we face, of greater activity and initiative, so that cooperation and defense can be strategic in what is cooperation within States. So that it can be more visible and effectively allow for growth, participation and development, or even greater commitment, in regional contexts.
But looking at the past, present and future, what has the dynamic been like in the defense area?
The book shows a certain dynamic of substantial constitutional growth in the first phase. Then there were very interesting developments, with some protocols and cooperation at the level of the Armed Forces, but there is still a lot to do, namely looking at the area of ​​defense cooperation as a strategic area.
The global geopolitical system appears to be changing very quickly, following a multipolar path. Should the CPLP have another role in this context, with actors such as China, Russia or the United States?
The CPLP is not a multilateral instrument, it is not an organization of that level. We have to place the CPLP at the level of the Commonwealth, for example, of organizations at a cultural, linguistic level, of partnership between countries, of concern for development. What I usually say is that the CPLP is a good diplomatic communication instrument, a soft power in areas related to conflict management and prevention. Let us not expect there to be armed forces, or an army, from the CPLP. This body is one of dialogue and cooperation. What we do, in terms of defense, is exactly that, create partnerships so that there are mechanisms for responding to disasters, to provide training capacity for the armed forces. There are even those who ask the question: why did the CPLP not intervene in Cabo Delgado, in Mozambique, on the issue of terrorism?
And why?
Because the CPLP is not a hard power mechanism, it has no capacity, doctrine, logistics, mandate or viability to be used in combat operations. And CPLP Member States are very aware that we are a very good mechanism for cooperation, partnership and development, with contributions to culture and language. Therefore, the CPLP will not intervene in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, because that is not its area, nor does it have mechanisms for this dynamic.
Is the existence of the CPLP justified?
I think so, obviously, because, as I said, the CPLP is a very good instrument in terms of cooperation, the dissemination of the Portuguese language, of history. The fact is that we have around 350 million people who speak Portuguese. We have 30 countries that are associated observers, such as Ukraine, Chile, and Portuguese culture is represented in this organization. Each country has what it wants from the CPLP and gives it the importance it thinks it should give, and this depends on the foreign policy of each State. But I think the CPLP makes a lot of sense in the world we live in, and does so as a multilateral representative of language, culture, cooperation between Portuguese-speaking states, and those that ultimately have some affinity [with the Portuguese-speaking world]. The Macau issue is very specific to this organization.
Macau has the role of a commercial platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, and China has an agenda for Lusophony.
Before 1999 Macau had its own status within the CPLP, as it was administered by Portuguese. There was a Joint Declaration that allowed Macau, not being a Member State, to have, in a certain way, a protocol [with the CPLP]. When it became a Macao SAR, things changed and it lost that connection status, and Macau is not a member of the CPLP, and obviously cannot be. Neither does China, and it cannot be. Therefore, there is an associated observer status here that arises for countries, international and regional organizations, and even territorial entities with their own administration, which is also not quite the case in Macau. The territory is in limbo, between having a very strong history linked to Lusofonia, and having an administration very linked to China, which gives it, in my perspective, two dynamics.
In what sense?
Macau is a fundamental element in the connection between the CPLP countries and China. For all reasons, but due to the issue of language, history, and its representation, it is a fundamental actor in this cooperation. Macau must effectively be seen as a partner and as a gateway for China to Portuguese-speaking countries. This is what, in a way, is already happening, and this is what the CPLP will be paying attention to, in this relationship in which Macau has a special status. Whether we like it or not, it has an impact. Macau is an attractive factor in facilitating relations between China and Angola, Portugal or Brazil.
Does Equatorial Guinea's stay in the CPLP raise questions of credibility?
I agree with you. In these 30 years, it has been one of the main difficult moments in creating consensus. I remember that Equatorial Guinea was admitted in 2014, but there was already a process in the previous analysis phase. There was always an extension, year after year, and it was difficult to reach a consensus within the CPLP countries. In 2014, there was a summit in Timor-Leste and, through the action of Brazil and Angola, there was, in a way, a lot of pressure for Equatorial Guinea to join. But there are two principles, for better and for worse, that justify Equatorial Guinea's presence in the CPLP.
What are…
The first argument is that, in fact, Equatorial Guinea has Portuguese as its official language in its Constitution, despite us knowing that the Portuguese language, for example, covers four or five percent of society as a whole, and I am already being quite generous. But there is a commitment from the Equatorial Guinea authorities to develop Portuguese as a working language and there is a historical connection to Portuguese culture and Lusophony. Another criterion is the promise that, in the next constitutional review, a commitment will be made to abolish the death penalty. As for Portuguese, it's something that takes generations, it's not done from one year to the next. Not even in the next 10 or 15 years will we have Portuguese perfectly implemented. There is some shyness, a commitment, in a way. As for the death penalty, the fact is that, it seems, some change has been achieved. There has never been a death penalty action again [since accession]. And there is hope that, in the next constitutional review, this fact will be abolished from the Constitution and that it may, effectively, cease to exist. As a member of the CPLP, these changes will be easier and more visible and, in the future, Equatorial Guinea can effectively assume CPLP status taking these premises into account. I don't know if it will happen, I leave here a reluctance, and this is a challenging moment for the CPLP itself. Work needs to be done from within, so that Equatorial Guinea can be at the same level as other countries, especially in these two areas.
What is certain is that there remains a certain lack of transparency regarding what is happening in the country.
We are aware that Equatorial Guinea has major problems with issues of democratic legitimacy and elections. There are a series of situations that we recognize are not perfectly adequate given the status of CPLP countries. I think there is hope that things can change, an attempt to create space for Portuguese to grow within Equatorial Guinea, and also a commitment to greater openness and participation. What is a fact is that Equatorial Guinea has participated in CPLP meetings, and I have participated in some. In international situations we have to be pragmatic, and we hope that, just because Equatorial Guinea is in the CPLP, this can help Guinea itself to develop some mechanical gestures.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Timor-Leste / Independence – Mari Alkatiri: Proclamation was anticipated by the Indonesian military presence</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/24/timor-leste-independencia-mari-alkatiri-proclamacao-foi-antecipada-pela-presenca-militar-indonesia/</link><description>Interview by Isabel Marisa Serafim, from the Lusa agency
The leader of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin), Mari Alkatiri, said that the unilateral proclamation of independence was scheduled for December 1, 1975, but was brought forward because Indonesian troops were already in the territory.
“It was initially scheduled for December 1st,” said Mari Alkatiri, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which is marked on Friday, and of the Indonesian occupation, nine days later, on December 7th.
In November, Mari Alkatiri went on a “safari” through several African countries, mainly the Portuguese-speaking African Countries (PALOP), which involved participating in the declaration of Angola’s independence on November 11, 1975.
"After this 'tour', this African 'safari', I returned to the country. At the time I was in Maputo to prepare my return and I received a call from Nicolau Lobato not to return, because we needed to have someone outside the country", he recalled, highlighting that he did not follow the order from the then vice-president of Fretilin.
“So I returned to Dili on the 22nd or 23rd of November and the central committee and military political committee were meeting at the current headquarters of the National Police of Timor-Leste, which was the provisional headquarters of Fretilin, and the proclamation for December 1st was being discussed”, he explained. On November 28, Mari Alkatiri, then 25 years old, recalled that Nicolau Lobato came to her house and said that it was necessary to proclaim independence that day.
"We both left in his car for Lahane where Xavier do Amaral [former president of Fretilin] was and we conveyed this to Xavier Amaral, who clearly said to wait another three or four days. We said there was no time to wait and we decided to make the proclamation that day in the afternoon", he said.
"Fortunately, not only was the Constitution ready, but also the flag was ready. It was my mother who sewed the flag. There were minimum conditions for the proclamation of independence", stated the current secretary general of Fretilin, who also wrote the text of the proclamation.
“When I start talking about these days it’s not just memory, I actively participated in the unilateral proclamation of independence, although people try to cut out my photo, politics, but the truth is that there is only one person still alive who actively participated in the proclamation 50 years ago, that’s me”, he highlighted.
In the first Timorese Government, led by Nicolau Lobato and which only lasted nine days, Mari Alkatiri was appointed Minister of State for Political Affairs. Nocolau Lobato led the fight against the Indonesian occupation and was assassinated in December 1978. The restoration of independence took place on May 20, 2002, after a referendum for self-determination on August 30, 1999 and 24 years of resistance against Indonesia.
A question of egos
Mari Alkatiri also stated, in the same interview, that “egos” are preventing Timor-Leste from overcoming the challenges and that a more democratic, inclusive and comprehensive leadership culture is needed.
"If we managed it at the time, with all the difficulties, with all the challenges to overcome, at almost the speed of light, why can't we today? That's the question, the question of the cause. When the cause unites, the journey can go on, with many setbacks here and there, but we will succeed and we will win", said Mari Alkatiri in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which marks this Friday.
Asked about the reason for no union, the leader of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin) ​​said it was “egos”.
“I am following the budget debate, when we continue to think about State matters in a 'cantin' way, we are not going anywhere”, criticized the former East Timorese Prime Minister, whose party chose to abstain in the final global vote on the State Budget.
Regarding criticism of the current government's options, Mari Alkatiri said she did not know if there was ever an option. "I don't see a strategy. There are some successes here and there, tries here and there, but there is no strategy, but there is a lot of support for strategic planning, strategic investment, but I don't see it", he stated.
“There is a need for a much more democratic, much more inclusive, very comprehensive leadership culture, with a sense of mission and vision for the future”, highlighted the secretary general of Fretilin. The party leader also warned not to wait for the “bomb to explode”.
“The delay bomb is there, the time bomb is there, I hope we don’t have to, after that, apologize for the truth, after the bomb goes off”, he highlighted. Asked if the “bomb” is dissatisfaction, the former prime minister said: “complete”.
"A country that after 24 years of restoring independence, with the means it had to work, why did it fail? Lack of sense of inclusion. We are building a State, we talk about the Democratic Rule of Law, is that true? Or oligarchic", he asked.
The new generations
Still in relation to young people, who represent the majority of the approximately 1.4 million inhabitants of Timor-Leste, Mari Alkatiri said that they feel lost. "Young people are naturally more generous when they are more considered, or more rebellious, when they are revolted. There are two facets here in youth, one of generosity when they embrace a cause, the other is a much more violent reaction of confrontation", he said.
Pointing out that more than 70% of the population is under 35 years old, Mari Alkatiri warned that those “two generations have already been sacrificed” due to “poor quality” education and “increasingly worse health” and “no prospects”. “Now, we all say that oil money will run out, I see that for the Government, the alternative to oil is oil”, he said.
In September, the capital of the Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund was US$18.95 billion (€16.4 billion). “We kept dreaming about Sunrise and as I usually say while we dream about Sunrise, we will have the ‘sunset’, because there is no politics, there are no plans, there are no programs”, he added.
Mari Alkatiri was referring to the Greater Sunrise gas field, located 150 kilometers from Timor-Leste and 450 kilometers from Darwin, whose project has been mired in an impasse, with Dili defending the construction of a gas pipeline to the south of the country, and Woodside, the consortium's second largest partner, leaning towards a connection to the existing unit in Darwin.
The consortium is made up of the Timorese company Timor Gap (56.56%), the operator Woodside Energy (33.44%) and Osaca Gás (10.00%). The Government of Timor-Leste announced on Saturday the signing of a cooperation agreement with the Australian Woodside Energy for studies to process and export gas to the country.
Missing discussions
The secretary general of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin), Mari Alkatiri, defended the need for “all together” to discuss what failed in the last 24 years, after the restoration of independence in May 2002.
"There is a lot of talk about new paradigms and the old paradigm, we are ready to sit down together to discuss the old paradigm, why did it fail? No", said the former Timorese prime minister, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which marks this Friday.
For Mari Alkatiri, everyone contributed with “their positive part, with their negative part”, but it is necessary to understand the failures in “individual terms”, in “collective terms” and there be “responsibility”. Asked by Lusa about the reasons why there is no such discussion, the leader of the Timorese opposition replied that a “leader who cannot sit at the table is not a leader”.
"The leader must know that there is a time to sit at the table. I made proposals. When I returned in 2018, I said 'my vote is so that the people can win', I didn't say for Fretilin to win. The message was clear, it was time for us all to think together. I ran the campaign saying Fretilin wins, Xanana wins", stated Mari Alkatiri.
The Fretilin leader said the response has been “revenge, hate”. "In such a way that to take revenge on me, it affects hundreds of people, families. If it's me, come and talk to me, you don't have to harm others, but this is a specific issue", he stated, referring to the Timorese Prime Minister, XAnana Gusmão. The fundamental issue, continued Maria Alkatiri, is “to have a sense of mission, a vision of the future and to have a common cause”.
"What is crucial is knowing all the money that was spent, what was done. A balance of collective and individual performance. When we were waging war, we knew what we wanted, to restore independence, 24 years after the restoration of independence we don't know where we are going", lamented the leader.
Mari Alkatiri also said he was “very concerned” about the report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which warned on September 11 of the proliferation of criminal networks in Oecussi, a Timorese enclave on the Indonesian side of the island of Timor, highlighting that recent investigations show contamination of the region.
"It is already being absorbed by the mafia cartel, who are coming here in all their strength. We have closed kiosks and we think we are fighting the mafia. I am very worried," he said. For the future, Mari Alkatiri stated that she will continue to fight, but to “create critical mass”.
"My fight now is not the concern with electoral cycles, but how I can actually create a true critical mass in Timor-Leste. Let's end blindness, many of our academic intellectuals get pregnant through their ears, but they don't get pregnant", he highlighted.
The Fretilin leader also told everyone in his generation that it is time to put “egos” aside and start “thinking together”, highlighting that they have another five years to do so. “The next term of governance must be the product of understanding if we really want this country to move forward”, stated Mari Alkatiri, highlighting that the Timorese people deserve “much more and much better” than what has been given to date.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 17:33:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Independence | Ramos-Horta: It is “thanks to Xanana” that Timor-Leste is here</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/23/independencia-ramos-horta-e-gracas-ao-xanana-que-timor-leste-esta-aqui/</link><description>The Timorese President, José Ramos-Horta, highlighted, in an interview with Lusa, the journey of the current prime minister and former leader of the residence, highlighting that it is “thanks to Xanana [Gusmão]” that Timor-Leste is here today.
“Xanana survived and with an impressive willpower, which few human beings can have, reorganizes the resistance, new attacks against the Indonesians”, said Ramos-Horta, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the declaration of independence, on November 28, 1975, remembering the attacks that the prime minister was the target of.
The Timorese leader lost men and suffered setbacks, but organized the clandestine network and resistance in the occupied cities. Xanana Gusmão was elected leader of the resistance and commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces for the National Liberation of Timor-Leste (FALINTL) in 1981, having launched the National Unity Policy, developed the Clandestine Front and established the National Council of Maubere Resistance, later named the National Council of Timorese Resistance.
"We reached the referendum in 1999 thanks to Xanana, not thanks to anyone else, obviously, the church got involved, because Xanana had the lucidity to talk to D. Martinho da Costa Lopes, abandon Marxism-Leninism. Thanks to Xanana that we are here today", stated the head of state.
Martinho da Costa Lopes was one of the most important figures in the Catholic Church in East Timor during the Indonesian occupation and played a central role in defending the human rights of the Timorese.
José Ramos-Horta also regretted that they now say that Xanana Gusmão is no longer the great man he was during the fight. "I say: gentlemen, now he was also the one who won the maritime border for us. I don't know who would win", he said, referring to the negotiation of maritime borders with Australia, concluded in 2018 and led by the current Prime Minister.
The President also highlighted that Xanana Gusmão was the one who took the historic decision to diversify from the Petroleum Fund in 2009, which “brought 11 billion dollars in return to Timor” and carried out the reconciliation, without persecution or judgment from anyone.
José Ramos-Horta also highlighted that it is Xanana Gusmão who “continues to have the technical competence” to discuss maritime borders with Indonesia, whose negotiation process began this year, as well as to resolve the Greater Sunrise issue, with the agreement expected to be signed at the beginning of next year.
"He wants to resolve all these issues before leaving power. He does not want to leave these very complex dossiers to the new generation", added the President.
Ideas and defenses
José Ramos-Horta stated that he was not in favor of the unilateral declaration of independence, on November 28, 1975, considering that it was made “hastily” given the imminent occupation by Indonesia.
"I was not in favor of the unilateral declaration of independence, I was, but it wasn't on November 28th. More preparation time was needed, because when you make a unilateral declaration of independence without any preparations, the result was what it was. There was no one. No one reacted", said Ramos-Horta, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary.
On November 28, 1975, the current head of state recalls a ceremony without the presence of a “single global personality” and a dark night. "The unilateral declaration of independence was made hastily for reasons determined by the circumstances of the time. The fall of Atabae [municipio de Bobonaro]", said Ramos-Horta.
"The base fell with a large onslaught of regular Indonesian forces, already deep inside Timor-Leste. First Batugadé fell, that was in October, Balibó and Maliana fell, in October and Atabai, fell in the early twenties of November. Soon after, Fretilin declared unilateral independence", explained the President.
The occupation by Indonesia took place on December 7, 1975. “Indonesian forces were already in the national territory before December 7 and the decision in Jakarta had been made in 1974 either Timor-Leste integrates into Indonesia peacefully through some pseudo-democratic act, or Timor-Leste would pass to Indonesian domination by force”, said the Timorese head of state.
The invasion is supported by the United States, Australia and some countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
"Obviously, in that context of 1975, the United States would not support Portugal on the issue of Timor-Leste. On the issue of Timor-Leste, Indonesia weighed more, especially in the post-Vietnam war context, in which the United States was discredited and fled. For the United States and for the countries in the region, the communist threat was real and Timor-Leste was isolated, abandoned", highlighted the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
The liberation of Timor-Leste took place on August 30, 1999, when the referendum for self-determination took place, which gave victory to independence, which would eventually take place on May 20, 2002, after a transitional administration by the United Nations.
“Twenty-four years later the country is freed against all the prophets of defeat, all those who preached realism to us, to me, some said atrocious unrealism, others said a lost cause, we heard a lot, including in Portugal”, added Ramos-Horta, highlighting that Timor-Leste managed to prevail.
Defense of the constitutional amendment
José Ramos-Horta defended, in the same interview, a constitutional amendment to adopt the presidential system in the country, because there is a need for “clear authority” and “without duality” and ruled out a re-candidacy for the position.
"I believe that we should make a constitutional amendment and move to the presidential system. The President is the executive, the so-called semi-presidentialism is over", said José Ramos-Horta, in an interview with Lusa as part of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, on November 28, 1975.
Currently, Timor-Leste has a semi-presidential system with a parliamentary bias, with the Government emanating from parliament. According to the head of state, the system chosen in the Constitution, drawn up in 2001 and 2002, “has not been bad at all”, but it has been seen that instead of “instead of being a balancing factor”, it can be a “factor of instability”.
Ramos-Horta exemplified what happened in the eighth Government, after the coalition led by Xanana Gusmão won the legislative elections with an absolute majority. “Xanana is invited to form a Government, they presented the list of rulers and President Lu Olo decides to veto, he did not want to inaugurate nine members”, said the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
"It is necessary to have a clear authority and without this duality, to share power with the President. It doesn't work. It works well in Portugal", highlighted Ramos-Horta. For the Timorese President, “there is no reason” for Timor-Leste to have adopted that model, because “balance is the parliament, the judiciary”.
"These three bodies are the constitution of the State. I think everyone will agree", he said. José Ramos-Horta considered that “it is time”, after around 25 years of the current Constitution, to make “some amendments” and move to the presidential system.
"For me, Xanana Gusmão should continue. We reach 2027, my term ends, new elections in 2028. Between the period of 2027, in which I leave, and 2028, we actively work on a constitutional amendment so that the 2028 election is already based on the new Constitution, that is what I defend", he explained.
When asked by Lusa whether he did not intend to run for a new term, the President stated that he was not “at least motivated”. “I, in 2027, will go to the ceremony of transition of the portfolio to the new President at midnight on May 19, 2027 and I won't even attend the ceremony on the 20th. I'm already in AeroDili on my way to Singapore”, he stated.
Problems of the new generation
In the same conversation, José Ramos-Horta also highlighted some of the country's current problems, namely the fact that the generation after 1975 has not yet found a leader with national affirmation. He highlighted that since 2002, members of this generation have held seats in the Government and parliament.
"The new generation has been there since 2002. The problem is that the new generation has not yet found a single person to assert themselves as a national leader. They have not yet appeared. That is the problem. They are in the Government, in the courts, in parliament, all new generations", said the President in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence.
José Ramos-Horta also questioned who is the leader of the new generation that “has a national dimension”. “There is none, not one, because in a democracy you have to win the electorate”, he said, highlighting that a party is created and that party competes in the elections.
The head of state highlighted, however, that today Timor-Leste already has 210 doctorates and 1,700 masters, graduated from “good universities” and “there are people who know”. Timorese civil society has accused the current Timorese leadership, which continues to focus on figures from the resistance era, of creating obstacles to the emergence of new leaders with the capacity to respond to contemporary challenges.
Asked whether, after 50 years of the unilateral declaration of independence, the Timorese are reconciled, Ramos-Horta stated that among the “factions of [19]75 more than reconciled”. "Some have even died, the majority have died. There is no problem at all. When I see some brilliant being saying 'they are still the divisions of 75', you don't know that the majority have already died, only if they are the souls in the cemetery", said José Ramos-Horta.
According to the President, the divisions result from the democratic struggle. “I find it ridiculous, interesting, sometimes frustrating when I hear that the Timorese are divided,” said the President.
"Very well, let's all unite like it is done in North Korea, or rather, single party, single candidate, it is already known who wins the elections in North Korea, so there is not much headache, everything is simple, 97% votes for Kim Jong-un, then they do the recount and after all it was not 97%, but it was 101%. It's an option, then we are all united", joked Ramos-Horta.
But, he added, the Timorese chose democracy. "A democracy that is praised today and survives the wave of setbacks against democracy in Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe. We are doing very well with democracy", he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-11-23 18:59:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Cuca Roseta, fado singer: “Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/cuca-roseta-fadista-o-fado-e-um-samba-poesia-cantado-vindo-do-coracao/</link><description>During the pandemic, she sang for the Macau public through a video concert, but now, the fado singer gives her heart and soul to a concert with the Macau Chinese Orchestra, part of the lineup for the Macau International Music Festival, next Saturday, 11th. In an interview with HM, Cuca Roseta talks about the show's lineup, her 15-year career and the truth found in her compositions.
Performs in Macau on October 11th with the Macau Chinese Orchestra (OCM). Tell me a little about what we can expect from this show.
Yes, we are finally going to Macau. It will be the first time because we previously did a video concert for Macau during the pandemic, and we were unable to be there physically. We now work with OCM, which is very good, and I am happy with this partnership, for being able to unite, in some way, two cultures. We are a little anxious about that fact.
The concert will have songs such as “Meu”, “Preto e Branco”, “Canção do Mar”, “Não Sei de Onde” and “Finalmente”. What does this alignment bring us?
We already had arrangements made for orchestra by Marinho de Freitas, which are extraordinary arrangements, and which will be adapted to the traditional OCM instruments. These songs are practically all written by me, lyrics and music, and tell different stories, some that I have lived myself or stories that, in some way, I have experienced someone living very closely. They are original fados. “Canção do Mar” is very old and became known in the voices of Dulce Pontes and Amália Rodrigues, and has a new arrangement. We thought it would look beautiful with OCM. Of course, there are songs that we always sing and that never leave the repertoire, linked to traditional phases of my career. There are some songs that people like and request, but we bring a completely different repertoire to what we presented at the time [in Macau, with the video concert], which was very well received. It was a concert that went very well, even though it was via video, and we received wonderful messages.
This year he released the album “Até a Fé Se Esqueceu”, which has an exclusively Brazilian repertoire, with several names in Brazilian music, such as Seu Jorge or Zeca Pagodinho. Why explore this universe, mixing it with the language of Fado?
Yes, but this year I will also release a French album with Amália Rodrigues' agent, who invited me. But “Até a Fé Se Esqueceu” came from an invitation from a great Brazilian producer to record old sambas, which have a lot to do with Fado. Even though it's a Brazilian album, all sambas, it's my saddest album of all, the most melancholic. That's why we went looking for this root of samba to find great poets and great composers that Brazil has, and who have this weight that Fado also has.
As?
Fado has a lot to do with words and composition, in fact, Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart, because there has to be this truth in the interpretation, the idea of ​​truth coming from life's experiences, in transforming the story it tells. This melancholy is in the veins of Portuguese blood and is mixed with art and music. This invitation wanted to put a fado singer to sing seriously and with the weight that Fado brings, and be able to interpret the great poets and sambas. The album [Até a Fé Se Esqueceu] has very old sambas, one of them from 1937. It is, therefore, a very strong and even very beautiful album, with great poems and composers, such as Tom Jobim, Vinicius de Morais, and wonderful partnerships with Seu Jorge and Zeca Pagodinho, who came to Fado. It's an album that made me really proud.

Therefore, it is possible to marry Fado with the joy of samba, which also has a melancholic side, right? Like the melancholy of our Fado.
In fact, when we hear the word samba we think of joy, but in fact the basis of samba is not joy. There is that phrase by Vinicius de Morais, “To make a samba beautifully you need a bit of sadness, otherwise you won’t make a samba”. So that's where the beauty of this work lies, which goes to the roots of samba and shows that there aren't that many differences between the melancholy at the root of samba and the melancholy of Fado. It's a nostalgic and melancholic album, it doesn't bring that joy. It can bring hope, and we can say that some themes bring with them this hope, which we find in Brazilian culture and drums. Because they literally put their sadness on the skirt wheel and on the drums, right? They transform sadness into dance and music, but in this work we don't see that type of samba.
Cuca also has a previous album, “Cabo Verde Nha Cretcheu”, so it can be said that she has explored, in her career, the different Portuguese-speaking sounds, going beyond Fado, mixing sounds?
This album didn't come from my will, and I think [it's a sign] that life takes me, deep down. This album was born from a tour I took across the nine islands of Cape Verde with a live recording of the mornas I sang on each island, as I sang the traditional mornas of each island. Between one island and another there are very different moraines. What I did was, after my Fado concerts, I sang two mornas and then we compiled all the songs in Creole in celebration of the fact that I was the first international artist to do the nine islands in a row. But I was also in Goa and did my concert in Concanim. I find it easy and enjoy learning the traditional songs of the countries where I am going to sing. I already sang in Moscow and learned a Russian song; I learned the songs of Goa, and in Georgia, in Tblisi, I also learned a song. It's a treat I make when I travel around the world taking Fado. But morna is wonderful and there really are similarities between this musical genre, and I wanted to bring this encounter between Fado and morna to Cape Verdeans, and this album came about, which is beautiful.
Once it goes to Macau, can we expect a song in Cantonese, or Mandarin?
Yes. By chance, I had already spoken to my manager to contact someone in this regard, so that we could discover a traditional song that I could learn.
Last year, he celebrated 15 years of career. How do you review your career, which began with the albums “Cuca Roseta” and “Raiz”?
In fact, it was great to celebrate 15 years at MEO Arena [the concert hall in Lisbon], and be able to revisit all the albums since the first. “Raiz” opened something that is rarer, which is the fado singer composing and writing her lyrics. This was a record that went wonderfully well and, from then on, it was good, because in this search for the truth that Fado has, being able to compose and write your own lyrics always means giving a little more of yourself. Each person composes and writes in their own way, and when they can do it, it is always a bit like the lines on the palm of their hand, that is, it is something unique. In this search that people make to follow standards to achieve success, I believe that success exists when we are not afraid to follow our voice and our instinct, what comes from our heart, tell our stories and sing our melodies without fear. In this way we end up becoming unique. Although it is not usual in Fado for a fado singer to compose and write, it was nice to see that my songs became important to many fans. Sometimes I have great composers and poets [to collaborate with me], but I think [writing and composing] brings out this side of the person being more truthful. My poems can never be compared to those of the great poets I have sung, but I think people feel that I am more in my own skin. In a way, this touches and moves them. Celebrating 15 years of career was the closing of a cycle and the beginning of another, and it was great to return to the “roots”, and realize that that was where the “gunpowder” lay, in the sense of not being afraid of ourselves.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:24:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist activist, 34 years old, physical engineer, Romani national. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied the right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on staying, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
The gentlemen we are talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Motorsport | GP will continue on the TCR World Tour in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/19/automobilismo-gp-continuara-no-tcr-world-tour-em-2026/</link><description>The Macau Grand Prix will once again form part of the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour calendar next season and, once again, as the season-ending event of a competition that will increase its presence in Asia in 2026
Marcelo Lotti, president of the WSC Group, confirmed to the press, during the weekend of the 72nd Macau Grand Prix, that next year's calendar should include a race in South Korea – home country of the tire brand and championship sponsor, Kumho, as well as Hyundai, the brand with the most cars on the starting grids of the world competition -, a second race in the People's Republic of China and the traditional end-of-season round at the Guia Circuit.
To increase the presence on the Asian continent, without affecting the teams' budgets, Australia will be left out of the calendar. The championship promoter will also not move forward with the possibility of organizing a second race on the American continent, with a visit to Mexico being a certainty. Already on the “old continent”, the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour will maintain its three events, with the Portuguese city circuit of Vila Real hosting one of these events in July.
For Marcello Lotti, “the Macau Grand Prix is ​​our equivalent to Monaco”, and for the Italian businessman, “all championships need an event like this”. Despite the smaller number of entrants that this year's event gathered in the territory, “leaving Macau is obviously out of the question”.
The 2026 Kumho FIA TCR World Tour season calendar is expected to be revealed to the public on December 13, when the FIA ​​World Council meets in Tashkent, Republic of Uzbekistan, at the same time as the FIA's annual awards ceremony.
Number questions
The list of participants for the Guia Race Macau – Kumho FIA TCR World Tour Event of Macau had only seventeen of the twenty-four cars initially registered. This would have been one of the smallest starting grids ever for the highly popular Guia Race, whose first edition took place in 1972. In part, this number below expectations was due to the absence, for unknown reasons, of teams and drivers from TCR China, one of the strongest national tourism championships in the world.
Meanwhile, Marcello Lotti said during the Grand Prix weekend that TCR is preparing to welcome a new brand to the championship. However, this announcement, scheduled for next Friday, is not expected to have an impact on the starting grids of the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour, as it will be a car group that already has a presence in the championship and will replace one of its brands with another. The Italian businessman also said he was in negotiations with a second brand.
Asia's influence on today's biggest Touring Car championship is not just limited to the Koreans from Kumho and Hyundai, as the competition also features the Chinese brand Link &amp; Co, at an official level, and the Japanese counterpart Honda. At a time when electric cars, SUVs and city cars are the focus of big brands, Asian manufacturers are still among the few that invest in cars, with fuel engines, with dimensions suitable for Touring events.</description><pubDate>2025-11-19 01:34:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Roadsport | Badaraco took the podium on his birthday, but ended up penalized</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/17/roadsport-badaraco-subiu-ao-podio-em-dia-de-aniversario-mas-acabou-penalizado/</link><description>On his birthday, Badaraco recovered from 17th to reach second place on the podium. Hours after the party, the bad news arrived, with a penalty relegating him to 15th. Rui Valente was placed off the track, after recovering several positions
On his birthday, Jerónimo Badaraco climbed to second place on the podium of the Roadsport Challenge race, after starting from 17th. However, the worst came later, when the top three, all local drivers, were penalized and relegated in the general classification, for overtaking other cars that had lost their way before the starting line, after the safety car had left.
The Macanese driver had a setback when he was relegated to 15th, after an almost perfect race: “It was very unfair and I think the stewards don't know what they are doing”, said Jerónimo. "I think the decision was not transparent. After the safety car came out, several drivers hit the barriers... of course we thought they weren't going to continue in the race after those crashes and we had to overtake them", he explained. “And even if we had stopped or slowed down in the face of these drivers' missteps, we would have created a much more dangerous situation for everyone, because the cars behind us would have been surprised by our braking, meaning there would have been more accidents”, he explained.
Even so, the Macanese assured HM that the penalty would not ruin his day: “I will continue to enjoy the day, I went up to the podium, drank the champagne, took the photos… More cup, less cup, I will continue to celebrate”, he guaranteed with a laugh.
Hours earlier, Badaraco had already explained that reaching the podium in Guia “is a different feeling” that justifies “80 percent” his choice to drive 26 years ago.
The driver was also satisfied with the race, considering that no one can take away the merit of what he achieved on the track, as he rose from 17th to 2nd: "Before the race I thought a lot about how I was going to approach the start, to recover positions, and I was confident of a good result. The most important thing was not to have given up, after qualifying, and not to have stopped believing that it was possible to reach the podium", explained the Macanese driver. “I know that the Guia Circuit always has a lot of changes throughout the race, there are a lot of safety cars and yellow flags, and I knew I had the experience, and also the calm, to be able to take advantage of the opportunities”, he highlighted.
“They ruined my race”
In turn, Rui Valente gave up and appeared disappointed, due to what he considered to be an excess on the part of the driver who tried to overtake him on the inside, on the curve leading to the São Francisco road. "I don't know what was going through the driver's head who tried to overtake me. I can't understand how he saw a space that simply didn't exist!", said Valente. "I was put out of the race. When I tried to make the turn, he touched me and that was it, my rear end was damaged and I had to go back to the pits to retire", he reported.
When the crash occurred that ended the race, Valente was circulating in the top 10, even after a less successful start, following the exit of the first Safety Car. Despite this aspect, the Macanese came to believe that it was possible to achieve a result in the top five: “I had a good pace, I was confident and I think I would achieve a result in the top five... It's the races...”, he lamented.
The Macanese also took stock of a “complicated” weekend in which he was also involved in another accident during the free practice session. "To be honest, it wasn't one of the weekends I had the most fun in Macau. I had that first touch, which conditioned my qualifying. In the race I actually did well, gaining positions, but they put me off the track...", he highlighted.
At 64 years old, Rui Valente now admits that he may be left out of the next edition of the Grand Prix: “With such a difficult qualifying model for Macau and then with races with so many accidents, I will consider what to do in the future”, he confessed. “I don't want to sit still, I want to stay active and involved in different activities, so if I find an activity that occupies me and makes me feel good, maybe I'll stay out of racing next year”, he said.

The safety car was on the track for too many laps, which greatly reduced the race time</description><pubDate>2025-11-17 05:00:35</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Unanimity regarding “Super Pole” in GT</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/gp-unanimidade-quanto-a-super-pole-nos-gt/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) should continue to focus on the “Super Pole” system for the ninth FIA GT World Cup, if this race is once again included in the program of the 73rd Macau Grand Prix next year
For the first time, in last November's edition, the ten fastest in Qualifying 1 had 20 minutes to prepare for the first “Super Pole” in the history of the FIA ​​GT World Cup, in which, in reverse order of times, each driver entered the track alone for one out lap, two timed laps and one return lap, with one-minute intervals between competitors and the possibility of using a new set of tires. The best time obtained between the two timed laps determined Qualification 2 “Super Pole”, which defined the starting grid for the Classified Race.
Following the success of this initiative, the international federation intends to continue applying it in the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup, having even produced a promotional video to confirm this. Lutz Leif Linden, President of the GT Commission and the FIA ​​Constructors' Commission, admits that this is something “very exciting for the spectators as well as the drivers”.
Present in Macau during the Grand Prix, the influential Stéphane Ratel, CEO of SRO Motorsports Group, co-organizer of the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup, also agrees with the measure, highlighting that it represents "an additional challenge and one that works. At SRO we do this on a global level. In the biggest events, like the 24 Hours of Spa, we have a 'Super Pole', and it is something we like."
Riders and brands agree
Drivers and brands were equally impressed with this first experience on the territory's streets. “Macau is already special and I think that, with this format, we had something even more special”, recalled Antonio Fuoco, the driver who gave Ferrari its first in Macau since 1995.
Ferdinando Cannizzo, head of Ferrari's Competizioni GT, reinforces the idea, highlighting the technical advantage when the challenge comes down to the driver and the circuit, without external interference. “Without cars, without traffic, you can really focus on your strengths and try to maximize the car’s performance”, said the Cavallino Rampante brand representative.
This qualification system, an important moment of the weekend given the difficulty of overtaking on the Guia Circuit, also adds an element of uncertainty and elevates the spectacle. Stefan Gugger, responsible for the development of Lamborghini's competition cars, said that, in his opinion, "it's an improvement for our fans. We can really see the performance of the driver and the car, which also represents a good challenge for the team."
Porsche, one of the brands that most advocated the mandatory introduction of expensive torque sensors in this race, was also one of the main drivers of the “Super Pole”. “I believe the new format is a real step forward,” said Thomas Laudenbach, Vice President of Porsche Motorsport. "It allows the drivers to have clean laps. It's a great step in the right direction, maybe with some tuning, but overall for me it's positive. I hope they maintain this format because it's fantastic."
Meanwhile, the date of the 2026 edition of the Macau Grand Prix is ​​expected to be confirmed next week, during the FIA ​​World Council, which will take place before the FIA ​​awards ceremony for 2025, in the city of Tashkent, Uzbekistan.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:52:45</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA will continue to invest in Formula Regional in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/24/gp-fia-vai-continuar-a-apostar-na-formula-regional-em-macau/</link><description>The fact that the FIA ​​switched from Formula 3 to Formula Regional (FR) continues to be a recurring theme when the topic is the Macau Grand Prix. Although the show's premier race did not disappoint in this year's edition, somewhat erasing the bad image left last year, there is still a widespread feeling that the international federation deprived the Grand Prix of its favorite race.
At the end of the 72nd edition, the Coordinator of the Organizing Committee of the Macau Grand Prix, Lei Si Leng, when questioned again by the local press about a possible return of Formula 3, stated that the organization will continue to cooperate with the FIA ​​to choose the races that best suit Macau. At the same time, the director of the Macau Sports Institute left the guarantee that the plan involves continuing to receive drivers of training age and who assert themselves as the future of motorsport.
“We have been communicating closely with the FIA ​​to find out which races can be held in Macau and the FIA ​​has selected the best drivers to come and compete here”, he said, adding that he hopes “that the best drivers can come to Macau and that we continue to collaborate with the FIA ​​to organize the most suitable races for Macau”.
On the FIA ​​side, there is the conviction that FR is the discipline that best adapts to the characteristics of the Guia Circuit, a layout that remains practically unchanged after seven decades of existence. The discontent that still exists is considered natural. “Motor sport is traditional, and I don't remember any change that was well received at the beginning, even good changes” admitted Emanuele Pirro, the current president of the FIA ​​Single Seater Commission, in conversation with journalists in Macau.
The former Italian driver, a connoisseur of the Guia Circuit and winner of the Guia Race with BMW, took advantage of his time in the Macao SAR to remember that “if we look at the history of Macau, it started with Formula 2, or Formula Pacific, and then moved on to Formula 3. In 1984, a journalist could have asked: 'why don't we race in Formula 2 anymore?' I think it's inevitable. Everything has a price. For us to have the privilege of having a circuit that has remained unchanged since Throughout its history, the price to pay is to use cars that continue to be reasonably safe. And I think Formula Regional offers a good balance in terms of speed.”
In a rare interview with the specialized magazine INSIDE, the former coordinator of the Grand Prix, José Manuel Costa Antunes, warned against letting the level of the race drop. "Today, with the transition to Formula Regional and Formula 4, which is not a problem, they are just different cars, we see more inexperienced drivers", said the man who was at the helm of the event for the longest time, touching on a sensitive topic: "Some people can simply buy a seat. That is worrying. As fans, we want real races, not red flags. We owe it to the history of the Grand Prix to recover that selection process, to ensure that only the best compete here."
Numbers support the decision
Looking at the time sheets, it can be concluded that the records for the main FR race were around 2m16s, around ten seconds slower than the times recorded in the last year of the FIA F3 single-seaters, in 2023. In historical terms, these times place the FR cars on a level similar to that of the Formula 3 cars of the late 1990s. However, from a safety point of view, the speeds reached in the “Sprint” for Curva Lisboa continues to be the main concern since Sophia Flörsch’s accident in 2018. With the suction cone, speeds above 290 km/h were common in 2023 with the Dallara F3, but the change to FR cars reduced these values to around 260 km/h.
In 2026, the new Formula Regional car, the Tatuus T-326, is expected to arrive in Macau, which is equipped with a three-cylinder, 1.6-liter Toyota ATM163T engine, prepared by Autotecnica Motori, which is more powerful and efficient. The chassis was designed according to the latest FIA specifications, in order to provide improvements in terms of performance, safety and aerodynamics, facilitating overtaking and promoting more lively racing. However, although lap times are expected to drop again, top speeds will probably not be dramatically higher.
It should be noted that the change to FR was not motivated solely by security concerns. When the FIA ​​granted Formula One Management (FOM) the commercial and promotional rights for Formula 3, the territory's race became a non-championship race of an international competition, limited to the participation of the same teams that competed in the championship. This change was received unfavorably by the promoter himself, as he never played a truly intervening role within the Grand Prix. Furthermore, holding the race in Macau, in November, involved particularly demanding logistics, with a negative impact on the planning and execution of pre-season tests.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 05:37:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Grand Prix Shorts</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/17/curtas-do-grande-premio/</link><description>Espectadores | More than 110 thousand passed through the stands
Over the four days of the Macau Grand Prix, more than 110 thousand people passed through the stands of the Guia Circuit, an increase compared to last year, which was marked by the passage of a typhoon. According to official figures, the good weather helped and on Thursday there were more than 15 thousand spectators, on Friday around 28 thousand and on Saturday 35 thousand. Yesterday, on the day of the main races, the number of spectators was over 32 thousand.
Tobacco | Harmony Racing fined
Driver Ye Yifei's Harmony Racing team was fined 500 euros after one of its members was caught smoking in the garage. According to the stewards' sanction, the team member was smoking when he was approached by those responsible. When he was caught, he immediately put out his cigarette, inside a glass, containing five other butts.
Great Bay | Lu Wenlong has become superior
Lu Wenlong (Lotus Emira) was the winner of the GT Cup-Greater Bay Race, finishing ahead of Han Lichao (Toyota GR Supra GT4 Evo2) and Liu Kai Shun (Lotus Emira). The experienced Leong Ian Veng (BMW M4 GT4) was the best driver in Macau, finishing in fourth place, very close to the podium. In what he admitted was a farewell to Guia, Darryl O’Young (Mercedes AMG GT4 EVO), who competed in the GT Cup for several years, did nothing more than withdraw. The Hong Kong driver crashed the Mercedes when he went head-on at the entrance to the San Francisco climb.
Organization | Satisfactory event
The coordinator of the Organizing Committee considered that the event ran satisfactorily and that it contributed, together with the National Games, to creating a festive atmosphere in Macau. Lei Si Leng highlighted the value of the seven races in the program for the Grand Prix, which he said was wonderful.
When asked about a possible return of Formula 3, the official stated that the organization will continue to cooperate with the FIA ​​to choose the races that best suit Macau. At the same time, he left the guarantee that the plan involves continuing to receive drivers of training age and that they are expected to establish themselves as the future of motorsport.</description><pubDate>2025-11-17 04:56:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau GT Cup | Fuoco avenges the 2024 disaster and wins without a hitch</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/17/taca-gt-macau-fuoco-vinga-desastre-de-2024-e-vence-sem-espinhas/</link><description>The Italian driver finally managed to take the Ferrari to the highest place on the podium, and overtook Raffaele Marciello, the driver he collided with last year at Curva do Lisboa, when he was leading, and which earned him a retirement.
Antonio Fuoco (Ferrari 296 GT3) was the winner of the Macau GT Cup, a race that he dominated from the beginning to the end. The Italian thus avenged last year's retirement, after being forced to retire, when he was leading, after a contact with Raffaele Marciello (BMW M4 GT3), at Curva do Lisboa.
"I think it's very special to win in Macau, especially after what happened last year. But this is part of racing, and the main thing was to come back this year, and manage to do everything well", said Fuoco. "The team did everything for us to come back and win (…) I tried to make a strong start, and push hard in the last corner to open up an advantage over the rest. I pushed a lot and at a certain point I was losing control of the car in the Mandarin Curve, but everything went well", he said.
Fuoco also praised the new qualifying format, with a second session only for the best qualified: “it was a lot of fun, I think it was a good change”, he considered.
In second place was Raffaele Marciello, who had won last year, but who in this edition never showed the pace to threaten Ferrari's dominance. However, the Swiss was once again involved in collisions, this time with Alessio Picariello (Porsche 911 GT3 R), who ended up in the barriers.
“I tried to recover at the beginning and I almost managed (…) but the Ferraris had a good start and it was a difficult race”, said the driver. “The car was very difficult to drive, so at a certain point I had to realize that the important thing was to reach the end”, he added.
Porsche with different fortunes
Porsche also secured a presence on the podium, through German Laurin Heinrich (Porsche 911 GT3 R). “I knew that starting from eighth place on the grid it would be very difficult to recover, but I think I benefited when I lost a position in the qualifying race, because that way I was on the most favorable side of the starting grid”, he reported.
Heinrich also acknowledged that he did not have the pace to achieve more than the lowest place on the podium. "I tried to put pressure on Raffaele Marciello, but I felt there was no progress for him, so I knew I could only do better if he made a big mistake, which he didn't. The race went like this also to make sure there was no pressure from behind", he pointed out.
Heinrich also regretted the touch on teammate Ayhancan Guven, which caused the Turk to be left out of the race: "On the one hand I'm happy with the podium, but I'm also sad about what happened. I think my colleague had a good pace and deserved more", he lamented.

Ye Yifei popularity phenomenon
Ye Yifei (Ferrari 296 GT3) returned to Macau, in the year in which he became the first Chinese driver to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the greatest achievement so far in motorsport in the Middle Kingdom. Despite racing in Macau with an Italian license, the Chinese driver was welcomed as a national hero and was one of the most sought after drivers in the paddock to take photographs and sign autographs. The driver even dreamed of victory, after starting from second place on the starting grid, but a less successful start meant he did not go beyond fifth place in the end. Nothing that would affect his popularity, given that after the race he continued to be the most sought after among fans.</description><pubDate>2025-11-17 04:54:41</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
