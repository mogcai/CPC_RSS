"US measures are absolutely inconsistent with the relevant WTO rules and ignore our separate customs status," Hong Kong government spokesman said in a statement. The territory executive "will formally initiate procedures in accordance with the WTO litigation resolution mechanism against US irrational measures to defend our legitimate rights," he added.
Last Thursday, Hong Kong's Secretary for Economic Trade and Development, Algernon Yau Ying-Wah, had already said the city was considering resorting to the WTO. Algrenon Yau condemned in a radio program the imposition of an additional 10 percent tariff on imports from the territory, classifying the irrational measure.
"It is a disrespect for the region status as a member of the WTO and Autonomous Customs Territory," he said. "Washington made a significant mistake by imposing these tariffs," he warned, installing the White House to "approach the decision with prudence." The secretary said that over the past decade, the United States have registered a commercial surplus of more than $ 270 billion with Hong Kong, underlining the benefits of bilateral trade.
In addition, he said that exports from the former British colony to the country represent only 0.1 percent of the total, suggesting a limited impact of new customs rights. Yau noted that in recent years, Hong Kong has diversified its markets, such as Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central Europe, to mitigate “the repercussions of geopolitics”, allowing local companies to adjust export strategies.</description><pubDate>2025-02-10 01:25:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Sport | Sam Hou Fai visited ice hockey selection</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/10/desporto-sam-hou-fai-visitou-seleccao-de-hoquei-no-gelo/</link><description>Executive Chief Sam Hou Fai was in Harbin in Heilongjiang province, where the Winter Asian Games take place, and met the ice hockey team, the only participants in Macao at the event.

The sixth edition of the Macau Somos Association Photographic Contest! - Portuguese Language Communication Association (ACLP) wants to contribute to a “greater understanding of the different ideologies and creeds” between the regions where Portuguese is spoken, the organization told Lusa.
“The question of understanding is closely related to ignorance that persists between the various ideologies and creeds in the countries and regions of Lusophony. Through photography, we intend to explore this cultural and religious diversity, ”said Somos's president! - ACLP, Marta Pereira. Under the theme “Man and the Divine”, the contest, which starts today and takes place until March 10, wants to “promote coexisting dialogue between religions or traditional local beliefs,” he noticed.
"The images must capture the essence of devotion, contemplation and the profound connection between humanity and the divine or the transcendent," said the person in charge, adding that "it is fundamental" that the works "allow a historical contextualization, reflecting the various influences cultural and religious that shape spiritual experiences in different regions ”.
Marta Pereira recalled that, in Macao, "the most practiced 'religion' is Buddhism, often associated with elements of other traditional Chinese beliefs and philosophies, such as Confucianism and Taoism." There is also a strong presence of "Christianity, brought to Macao by Catholic and Protestant missionaries."
“If we look at Brazil, candomblé, a religion of African origin, is based on the worship of nature and its soul, and is therefore considered soul. In Timor-Leste, the population still remains rooted in the cult of ancestors and belief in spirits, ”he exemplified.

Environmentalist Joe Chan Chon Meng told Lusa that it is “absolutely impossible” Macau to reach the goal for electric vehicles in mainland China, from 45 percent of new sales by 2027. In early January, the Chinese government released a list of objectives Environmental, which includes a rise review of the previous goal for electric vehicles, which was 20 percent by 2025.
In the second half of last year, the tramful ones represented more than half of the sales of new vehicles, according to data from the China passenger automobiles association. In Macao, 31.4 percent of the new vehicles recorded in 2024 were electric, according to official data. But the president of Macau Green Student Union stressed that fossil -powered vehicles “continue to represent a great proportion” of the territory park.
At the end of December, Macau had a total of 253,182 vehicles, of which 12,302 vehicles (4.8 percent) were existing electric, according to the direction of services for traffic issues (DSAT). Still, Joe Chan stressed that in recent years, the government has implemented several measures to promote less polluting transportation, including the creation of more loading spaces for electric vehicles.
Farther
At the end of 2023, Macao had 2,100 electric charging places for light cars and 500 for motorcycles, indicated the direction of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) on his portal.
Authorities launched in 2023 a financial support plan for the slaughter of obsolete motorcycles and new electrical motorcycle replacement of a maximum of eight thousand patacas. According to DSAT, in 2024 Macao had 128,542 motorcycles, and only 3.5 percent were electrical, an increase of 1.4 percentage points over the previous year.
Joe Chan suggested that authorities start by restricting heavy goods from goods, namely those used in construction, and public transport, "since Zhuhai [the city neighboring Macau] and border zones use natural gas and electricity." On Wednesday, DSAT officials told Radio Macau's Chinese channel that there are 929 new energy buses in operation, representing more than 92 percent of the total, while the proportion of more polluting buses descended to about 3 percent.
As for taxis, there are only only electrical in circulation, representing about 11.9 percent of the total number, while the hybrid taxis represent about 86.2 percent of the total. "However, when it comes to highly polluting vehicles, such as trucks and heavy motorcycles, authorities have not yet defined a very clear calendar and deadline for their progressive elimination, so pollution [they cause] is high." , lamented the environmentalist.</description><pubDate>2025-02-10 01:10:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Coloane | Old prison will be returned to the government</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/10/coloane-antiga-prisao-vai-ser-devolvida-ao-governo/</link><description>The facilities and parking park of the old Coloane prison are being cleaned and will be returned to the Government of MSAR.

The change in the facilities of the Coloane Prison from Vila to Ká Hó will add new spaces in a territory zone that authorities nickname as “the garden of mashes”.

The authors warn of the “long way to go regarding the promotion of sustainable tourism”
 
The Macao Tourism sector has changed in recent years and the visions of the tourists themselves as well, facing the territory as a place where one can walk and enjoy leisure zones, not as much as a game land. This is one of the conclusions of the “Tourism as A Driver of China's Cultural Soft Power: The Role of Macau and the Convergences Between The New Silk Road and the Greater Bay Area” [Tourism as the engine of China's Soft Power: The Role From Macao and the convergences between the new silk route and the Great Bay area], by Pedro Steenhagen, Fudan University, and Sofia Xiaoying Hou, linked to the Xi'an University of International Studies. Analysis of the tourism industry at MSAR is one of the chapters of the book “The Palgrave Handbook on China-Europe-Africa Relations”, recently edited.
Thus, it is concluded that “the perception of the image of Macau by tourists has been changing in the last 10 years, being the more and more seen as a place of leisure and vacation in general, and not specifically or purely as a game center. ” It is also added that “the image of masters as a tourist destination is in transition, and people visiting Macao have greatly valued their unique cultural attractions, including their architecture and gastronomy, the result of the mixture of Chinese and Portuguese cultures and inheritances” .
However, the authors consider that "Macau still has a long way to go regarding the promotion of effective sustainable tourism." It is understood that sustainable tourism “must fully take into account its economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, sector, environment and related communities”.
In this field, the authors highlight, quoting another author, that "Macau has made efforts to achieve good grades in these and other stories, as the tourism industry of MSA has been undergoing a" silent revolution "since the beginning of the pandemic."
It is also noteworthy that, worldwide, the International Tourism Organization has created some guidelines on sustainability, creating “an important framework of sustainable tourism”. For this, “five fundamental pillars were proposed to evaluate the sustainability of the tourism sector of a state”, such as “tourism policy and governance; trade, investment, data and competitiveness; Employment, decent work and training; Reduction of poverty and social inclusion; and sustainability of natural and cultural environments ”.
The Silk Route
The academics also analyze the role of the Macao tourist sector in the strategy of “a track, a route”, noting that the territory “has been gaining a prominent role in local, regional and external policies, being an actor capable of improving the Tourism Silk Route and streamline tourism in the Great Bay region ”.
Macau is understood to make new contributions to the way China presents its culture, because “due to existing heritage and tourist products, it presents the Chinese culture to foreign visitors through a new, more diverse lens that goes beyond traditional” . Thus, tourists are allowed, “especially in the Lusophone world, [create] a better connection and understanding of the country through common historical and cultural bonds”.
With regard to the Great Bay project, it is also considered that both this region and the territory of Macao have “actively integrated the tourism development strategies in the BRI frame”, ie “Belt and Road Initiative”, English designation for “a track, a route”.
Macao has “a diverse and distinct range of tourist resources, such as the arts, history, constructions and religious traditions, gastronomy, sport, museums, among others”, and local authorities have sought, according to the authors, “Mark its tourist industry, promoting 'Tourism+' with transfronic cooperation in the scope of bri”. The idea is to “create an image of Macau as a city with diverse cultures, integrating the sectors of tourism, entertainment, culture, sports, business, conventions and exhibitions, health care, recreation, technology and big events”.
IMPROVEMENTS ON COURSE
Pedro Steenhagen and Sofia Xiaoying Hou understand that the Macao government “has been trying to improve cultural soft power and increasing tourist attractiveness through product development, facilities improvement and advertising”, and “projects to improve Facilities such as hotels, restaurants, transport and digital tours. ”
The example of two digital pathways created by the Cultural Institute, namely, in 2021, “The House of the Family of Zheng Guanying” and also “Fortaleza da Guia”. Moreover, authorities have created several interactive platforms using increased virtual reality.
Despite all the efforts pointed out to the local authorities, it is understood that "masters still have an unexplored potential to reinforce cultural ties between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, and this decade may present great opportunities in this regard."
The tourist bet
In this chapter, the authors also look at the positioning of tourism in the initiative “a track, a route” by Beijing, given that “China has been increasingly paying attention to the need to expand its cultural soft power , both regional and global. ” Thus, the country "has formulated several cultural development plans associated with" a track, a route "and the area of ​​the great bay, and tourism has constantly appeared as an essential element of its global strategy.”
In the country "tourism has gained relevance, either as a means of improving international image and as a source of revenue." Only in 2018 “about 159 million visitors traveled to the country, which invested $ 155 billion in tourist infrastructure-a value behind the United States, but should become the first by 2028- once you saw the sector represents 11 percent of your total gross domestic product. ”
The authors argue that “by connecting and increasing the dynamics between BRI [Belt and Road Initiative] and the Great Bay area, with an interesting effort on the diversification of Macao's economy and strengthening its tourist sector, as well as among the objectives. National and regional, China seems to be finding a way to boost tourism and reap the fruits in terms of cultural soft power. ”
Thus, and in the long run, it is considered that the country “may not only grow the power of its narratives and culture, but also improve normative power and institutional positioning in the world scene, especially with regard to issues of governance ”.
It should be noted that the book “The Palgrave Handbook on China-Europe-Africa Relations” is edited by Yichao Li, Jorge Tavares da Silva, Carlos Rodrigues and Francisco José Leandro, from the University of Macau. The edition is in charge of Palgrave Macmillan.</description><pubDate>2025-02-10 00:56:28</pubDate></item><item><title>WTO | Hong Kong complains against US tariffs</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/10/omc-hong-kong-apresenta-queixa-contra-tarifas-dos-eua/</link><description>Hong Kong will file a complaint in the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the face of the imposition of new tariffs by the United States to the products and services of that Chinese semi -autonomous region.

Marta Pereira recalled that, in Macao, "the most practiced 'religion' is Buddhism, often associated with elements of other traditional Chinese beliefs and philosophies, such as Confucianism and Taoism." There is also a strong presence of "Christianity, brought to Macao by Catholic and Protestant missionaries."
“If we look at Brazil, candomblé, a religion of African origin, is based on the worship of nature and its soul, and is therefore considered soul. In Timor-Leste, the population still remains rooted in the cult of ancestors and belief in spirits, ”he exemplified.
To whom it is intended
The competition, defines the regulation, is intended “to all citizens of the countries and regions of Lusophony or residents of Macau” with work done in Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Macao, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome and Prince, Timor-Leste and Goa, Damão and Diu.
The assessment of the candidate works is up to a jury chaired by Portuguese photojournalist in Macau Gonçalo Lobo Pinheiro and also featuring António Leong (Macau), Samba M. Baldé (Guinea-Bissau) and José Sena Goulão, Reinaldo Rodrigues and Alexandre Coelho Lima (Portugal).
The three winning images will be awarded prizes worth ten thousand patacas, seven thousand patacas and five thousand patacas, and honorable mentions can be conferred. In addition to the pecuniary prize, the first place will be contemplated with the trip and stay in Macao -if not reside in the territory -to participate in the opening ceremony of the usual exhibition of Somos -ACLP, to be organized later this year, and in ' Locally organized workshops.
In addition to the winning images, the exhibition completes other photographs selected by the jury “for its relevance or value” for the theme of the contest and “the purpose of the association of projecting the cultural dimension of Lusophony, as well as the role of Macao as a platform that unites China and the countries/regions of Portuguese Language ”, read in a statement from the Association.</description><pubDate>2025-02-09 17:24:44</pubDate></item><item><title>“I'm still here” highlighted in the Goya awards</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/09/ainda-estou-aqui-destacado-nos-premios-goya/</link><description>Walter Salles's “I'm still here” won the category of best Ibero-American movie in the Goya awards in a ceremony that attributed “Emilia Perez”, a work of Jacques Audiard involved in controversy, the title of best European film.
This is the first time that a Brazilian feature film has been recognized in Goya, and director Walter Salles, through a message read by Uruguayan musician Jorge Drexler, expressed gratitude for this “very special” award. He remembered, moreover, that the work is about the memory of a family “during the long night of the military dictatorship in Brazil”.
The film recalls the story of former deputy Rubens Paiva, who was arrested, tortured and killed by the Brazilian dictatorship in 1971, and his wife, activist and lawyer Eunice Paiva, who had to resume family life with her children, and who tried to complain justice for the death of her husband, whose body was never found. The lead roles are played by Fernanda Torres and Selton Mello.
Audiard
Also this Saturday, "Emilia Perez", by French director Jacques Audiard, won the award for best European film. The music film tells the story of a leader of a drug cartel who fulfilled the desire to make the transition to women.
The victory of “Emilia Perez” was announced during the ceremony in Granada, but the vote ended on January 24, a few days before the beginning of the contagonist's polemics generated by the protagonist, Karla Sofa Gastón, published for years, some with Racist content.
In these publications, released in late January by an American journalist, Gascon described Islam as a “focus of infection for humanity” and mocked the anti-racist movement after the death of George Floyd, African-American killed by police in 2020 .
The Spanish press had been speculating for some time about the possibility of Gascon, who had to cancel his presence at various events in the United States, attend the Goya ceremony. But the actress, who lives near Madrid, eventually did not move to Granada.
“Emilia Pérez” hit the record for the non -English language movie more appointed to the Oscars, with 13 nominations, among which for better film, international film, realization, photography direction, main actress and secondary actress. The feature film, which has been a success since the presentation in the Cannes Film Festival, has been the target of another controversy in recent weeks, this time in Mexico, where it was criticized for lightly appropriating tragedies linked to drug trafficking .
Still in Granada, Spaniard Marcel Barrena's “El 47” was the film that raised the largest number of awards, in a total of five goyas (film, secondary actor, secondary actress, production direction and special effects). He shared the best film award with “La Infiltrada”, by Aragentxa Echevarría, which was also worth Carolina Yuste the title of best actress.
Eduard Fernández, protagonist of ‘Marco’, held by actor Arregi and Jon Garaño, took home the best actor award.
“La Stralla Azul”, Spanish and Argentina co -production, directed by Javier Macipe, won the best newcomer and revelation actor categories. Already the dramatic comedy “Casa en llamas”, by Dani de la Ordin, won the best original argument. “According to Award” by Isaki Lacesta and Pol Rodríguez, he won three Goyas (achievement, sound and editing).</description><pubDate>2025-02-09 17:20:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Hamas | Five released Thai hostages return home</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/10/hamas-cinco-refens-tailandeses-libertados-regressam-a-casa/</link><description>Five Thai hosts released by Hamas arrived in Bangkok yesterday, 16 months after they were kidnapped by the Palestinian Islamite group in Israel, international agencies reported.

Last Thursday, Hong Kong's Secretary for Economic Trade and Development, Algernon Yau Ying-Wah, had already said the city was considering resorting to the WTO. Algrenon Yau condemned in a radio program the imposition of an additional 10 percent tariff on imports from the territory, classifying the irrational measure.
"It is a disrespect for the region status as a member of the WTO and Autonomous Customs Territory," he said. "Washington made a significant mistake by imposing these tariffs," he warned, installing the White House to "approach the decision with prudence." The secretary said that over the past decade, the United States have registered a commercial surplus of more than $ 270 billion with Hong Kong, underlining the benefits of bilateral trade.
In addition, he said that exports from the former British colony to the country represent only 0.1 percent of the total, suggesting a limited impact of new customs rights.

Fernão Lopes de Castanheda, History of the Conquest of India, Book IV, Chapter XLI.
“We arrived at the port of Chinchéu, we found three ships from Portuguese that had been a month ago that were arrived (from Liampó) of which we were very well received and wrapped with a lot of party and contentment and then gave us new land, and the merchant , and the peace and quiet of the port. ”
Fernão Mendes Pinto, pilgrimage, chap.57
"When the Portuguese, in the 16th Century, Recovered China to European Knowledge, Zayton Was in the longing the great haven of forreign trade."
Henry Yule, The Book of Marco Polo The Venetian, London, John Murray, 1874, Chapter LXXXII, II Vol., Pag 221, Note 2.
Among the reports of our 16th century chroniclers and adventurers there is some confusion as to the exact location of the place we called Chincheo. The toponym appears associated with two different but close spaces, the cities of Quangzhou 泉州 and Zhangzhou 漳州 or, by extension, the Chincheos will be the inhabitants of the current province of Fujian, and Chincheo may still be the name of the province itself. Now to Quangzhou, the two characters - who sound like "chuanchou" in Mandarin - have the approximate reading of "Chinchew" in the local pronunciation, in the Hokkien or Fulaohua 福佬话 福佬话, (the old language of Fujian), a subgroup of the great min of the South South spoken in the province of Fujian. From "Chinchew" to the chincheo of the Portuguese in China goes a very short step. Moreover, it is curious that, in addition to the Mandarin, the most spoken dialect in Taiwan, Formosa, is exactly the Hokkien since part of the island's population is originally from the Quangzhou region, emigrated to Taiwan in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Not wanting to enter any other discussion, I believe the city of Quangzhou, such as Liampó or Ningbo 宁波, in the neighboring province of Zhejiang, [1] will be the major ports of commerce and shelter of the Portuguese of the first half of the 16th century, still still Prior to the foundation and fixation in Macau, which will only happen from 1553/55, after our sailors, merchants and adventurers were expelled from these two cities by the Chinese because they are foreigners and have assumed behaviors of true haitao 海偷, the "pirates of the sea" as the Chinese called us. Just read the saga of António de Faria in the pilgrimage of Fernão Mendes Pinto to understand how to trade but also loot, steal, live extremely part of the Portuguese hundredists of the Portuguese by lands of China. Just as they entered the daily lives of other peoples, including Chinese.
Quangzhou or Chincheo, or if we want to Zaiton of Marco Polo that in his book he considers her “a of the two best and Mayors that sound in the world” was one of the first places on China's back to navigation, point of scale and often at the beginning of what is conventionally called the “sea silk route”. From here he left Marco Polo on his long return trip to Italy. It is believed that Zaiton, the Arab name in Quangzhou,-also associated with “olive”-gave rise to the words “satin” in English and “satin” in Portuguese, all related to the many tons of silk that exported by Porto from Quangzhou. [1]
In the dynasties Song and Yuan (from 960 to 1368), the city has reached the zénite of its development as the great warehouse of the seas of Asia. They were Muslim merchants, especially Persians - who since the ninth century they gave body to the expansion of Islam to the vast Southeast Asia - which settled in Quangzhou where they calculate they had reached 150 thousand souls. It was so strong its economic power in the city that between 1345 and 1365 were the subject of a brutal persecution by the Chinese powers, and there were thousands and thousands of dead. In the fourteenth century, Zaiton was also inhabited by Jews, Hindu and Catholics, and the Italian Franciscan Andrea of ​​Perugia was the first bishop in the city in 1332. Then dozens of mosques and three churches, all devastated in the persecution in those years.
In the summer of 2013, I am in search of the city of Zaiton, Quangzhou, Chinchew or Chincheo.
Seventy kilometers of bus since Xiamen and I arrive in the city that seems to me harmonious, well distributed by the valley and the hills that surround it. Where is the river, where is the port? I ask and are saying that Quangzhou has no sea port, only at the mouth of the river, in front of the islands, there is a small port for fishing boats. Path miles along the Jinhera River towards the sea. The river is hardly navigable, everything is blown away, the sand and mud have once deposited in the bed of deep water, the current city lives almost its back facing the Jinhera River and the ocean. The great port of Zaiton, the most likely Chincheo of the Portuguese in China, was swallowed by the mud, the sands deposited in the river, and, before its mouth, the waters almost disappeared with the centuries.
I get a taxi and tell the driver's wife, an affable and friendly lady, I want to go, always on the bank of the river, to the mouth. It's four or five more kilometers, but the driver asserts me that there is no large port, just a village of fishermen and fishing boats. We advanced on the road. I guess a hundred trainers, all blue, made in China, moved down there. There is even a port at the mouth of the river, also with benches and restingas, with a lot of sand and mud, but a port against the sea.
I leave the taxi and advance to the pier, for fishing boats aligned next to the jetty, I enter the confusion of those who arrive with fish to discharge and to sell. Women carry heavy buckets of fish suspended at the end of bamboo sticks, others sitting in stools clean crabs and oysters, others, still, with an entredious hair that turns on the head in a safe pulling by a kind of chopsticks, packing fish Loose and seafood that sell in small lots. There are men playing Weiqi, Chinese chess, and players loudly hitting the top of makeshift tables. Some fishermen, certainly tired of the sea, are quietly watching the bullied mixed with the calm of these seaside people.
Attraven the street, the way to the village next to the side that seems to keep the past centuries. Low wooden houses, some of one townhouse, decrepit and poor. Narrow streets, quite filth, small shops, one or another house of food, almost only fish and seafood, old planted in the threshold of houses, boys jumping happy by alleys and alleys. I'm in Quangzhou, in the chincheo of five hundred. Porto and the city should be so in the sixteenth century and, when returning, I prove, that I am not in a village but in the extension of the old Quangzhou urban fabric itself. Almost guessed Fernão Mendes paint with the conversation with António de Faria, perhaps his alter ego, in a reed, anchored at the mouth of the Jinhera River, here, Chincheo, the year 1545.
The next day, visit the Quangzhou Maritime Museum, meeting the history and the many navigations for these seas of Fujian, southern China.
In the fundamental Chinese sources there is almost no reference to Portugal and the Portuguese. If we were the first to terrify these stops, in the sea connection between Europe and the Empire of the middle realized in 1513 with the arrival of Jorge Álvares to Toumen, at the current Hong Kong, Guangdong province, we were not the pioneers in the navigations along of the back and in the stay in China. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Marco Polo, the Franciscan Muslims and missionaries, all journeying for the old Zaiton, deserve the honors of museum exposure, with the exposure of stones and headds recently discovered with extensive texts in Arabic and tumular stones with Christian crosses.
It is interesting to show the different types of boats that in the past have ventured into these seas, from the high-sea junctions of Admiral Zheng He (1377-1433) that with these ships navigated to Mombasa in 1433, to the stems and ships, these yes linked to a Portuguese presence. Also noteworthy is the patriotic figure of Zheng Chenggong (1624-1662) or Koxinga, who from pirate spent the national hero after expelled in 1661 the Dutch seated 38 years ago at Forte Zeelhand, Taiwan, where they controlled Formosa Island.
Even next to the Maritime Museum is another three-story building, which also works as a kind of museum, the Islamic Cultural Center where the Muslim community once resident in Zaiton/Quangzhou is honored. At the entrance we came across a statue of IBN Battuta (1304-1377), Tânger's great natural Arab traveler, just below our Algarve, who in the fourteenth century undertook a very long journey to China and left us a fabulous account of their travels, something similar to the “book of Marco Polo”. Battuta lived for a year in Zaiton, exactly 1346. In the Garden of the Cultural Center we found a cemetery for the deceased illustrious Muslims in the city and it is also worth visiting the great Qingjing mosque, originally built in 1009 by the first proselytes of Islam and that remain restored ruins, and a portico. Taking advantage of the space adjacent to Qingjing, a new mosque has just been built with money from Saudi Arabia, not too large, but witnessing a long past and relationship, not always affectionate and peaceful, between Islam and China.
Returning to our five hundred sailors will be to remember that the Portuguese of then were not much given to visit mosques, pagodas, Buddhist temples or Taoists. But in Quangzhou/Chincheo, since the year 686, a magnificent set of pavilions and pagodas dedicated to Buddha veneration, the Kaiyuan temple. Around the year 1100, in the Song Dynasty (960-1279) was inhabited by more than a thousand monks. Today, in the temple of Kaiyuan, stand out the two beautiful stone pagodas, equal, not too high, just five floors with the walls covered by low-relevous original, all dated from the thirteenth century when Zaiton or Quangzhou was one of the big cities From China.
Few people visit Kaiyuan. The unfolding of the gaze, a little reverence for the Buddhas, remember Portugal and the Portuguese of Anthony, and dilute me in the serenity of the day.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Ba Juyi (772-846), the preclarious poet of the Tang who has known the separation of his family since he was ten years old, sent north to escape a war, and then in his unstable life as an employee ziguly in the empire occupying government posts In distant cities, he celebrated in many of his most singular poems, meetings he had.

January 29, 2025
To know more deeply the nature of wooden serpent Yin (乙巳蛇 yǐ sì shé), it will be convenient to analyze the stories related to this reptile of the sixth terrestrial field in close association with the female principle.
It comes closely associated with the matriarchal divinity nϋwa (女娲 nǚwā) in the following myths “nϋwa creates humans” (女娲造人 nǚwā zào fench) and “nϋwa to the sky” (女娲补天 nǚwā bǔ tiān). In myths divinity arises alone, complete in itself, as a creative force, in the first myth, and as a regenerating and constructive force in the second, when mending the sky.
As a mother of humanity, he did not remember being the following one of a visit to Earth, having first created the animals, but as he still felt deep loneliness, he decided to generate human beings: he could do so for containing powerful energy Soul, manifested in his quality of being heavenly, whose physical appearance was distinguished, because although he had a human head, he had a serpent body. It spontaneously generated with the help of the clay, that is, the Earth, an element to which it is indissolibly linked, either in the underground world, in wells, or in its agile climbing by the mountains and trees in an instinctive search for heavenly ascension.
It is still this same figure with a serpent body that will replace order on Earth, when it plunges into chaos, following dignifying titanic forces, as in some versions it is affirmed that he has not wounded the sky after the god of northern Água do Norte, gonggong Founded his head against Buzhoushan (共工怒触不周山 Gònggōng Nù Chù Bùzhōushān), in an attack of fury against Northern Heavenly Emperor, Zhuanxu (颛顼 Zhuānxū), following the defeat inflicted by this.
The way it has not taken the sky, the care it has put in raising its pillars, establishing them with the aid of stones, whose colors (green, yellow, white, dark and red) indicate the presence of the five elements, essential to Life, as well as the foundation of them erected on the paws of a black turtle, in order to ensure their longevity but even eternity; The precious aid he granted to humanity in the fight against beasts that in the bastard of collapse pulled, the works of drainage he then made, transformed this deity with the body of serpent into one of the foundations of Chinese religious culture and civilization.
Note is the powerful ambivalence of this reptile, since it was not booming the body of serpent, Gonggong, the Folunum God of Water, is described with the same body of serpent, otherwise see how portrayed in “Gonggong throws the head against Buzhoushan: “Gonggong was a descendant of Yandi. It had a body of serpent, face and human limbs, as well as red hair, which indicated its fiery, energetic and adamant character ”(WANG, ALVES, 2009: 54).
Serpents have poison, which heals as much as it kills, and can become, by their immense mutation capacity, into excellent humans as in the case of Banga Serpent (白娘子 Bai Niángzi), even in small dragons (小龙 xiǎolóng), when developing The generous and meditative facet, when connecting and advocating superior values, such as love, in the famous legend that came to us, for example, through Zhao Qingge (赵清阁) in 《白蛇传》 (Bai shé zhuàn).
However, by their strength, capacity and intelligence can conflict as in the history of popular literature “discussion between serpent and the sun”, which might be able to find cultural equivalent in the Aesop's fable competition “wind and the sun”.  In “The Serpent argues with the sun” (蛇与太阳的争吵) There is an obvious rivalry between the sun, representative of the yang male element, beautiful, bright, hot and powerful and the equally portentous serpent, considers themselves as much power from the earth.
It challenges the sun, beginning a conflict between the power of the lunar mysterious and hidden forces, represented by the serpent, and the splendid irradiative brightness of solar energy. Finally the fable ends not with the victory of the sun, in the manner of Aesop, but with the need for recognition of complementarity, because without the alternation of night and day, sun and shadow, heat and cold the world, As the Chinese understand it (based on this tension harmony) would not be complete. Moral of History: If there was no sun, it would be the death of the earth, for it would plunge into an infinite night, if there were no snakes, it would be equally the end of the world, because there would be no agility, no ability to transform, plunging “everything that exists under heaven ”(天下 tiānxià) in immense rigidity and monotony.
The serpent, as a sixth terrestrial field of the Chinese zodiac (十二生肖蛇 shí´èr shēngxiào) also symbolizes the ingenious animal, which, due to its powerful intelligence, is able to architect and carry out a well -calculated plan. This is proved by his biography upon entering the heavenly race promoted by the Emperor of Jade (玉皇大帝 Yù Hung dàdì).
The serpent and the dragon used to be good companions and share the same aquatic spaces, when he learned of the emperor's intention to organize a competition so that twelve animals could command the stars and destinations of humans. Given the powerful intelligence of the reptile, he realized that he had no hypothesis or quickness to overcome the dragon, but as he knew how to make good calculations and better plans, he shared discreetly to the horse's back, without the one he was carrying a rival nearby From the goal it jumped to position herself in front of the equity, and so it was, both good friends to our day, since the always generous horse never charged her the ride.  For the Chinese, the serpent symbolizes “a powerful and victorious mill” (以巧胜力 yǐ qiǎo shènglì).
Another story draws attention to the importance of forgiveness in the ascetic process of the serpent towards transformation into a small dragon: “the serpent and the farmer” (蛇与农夫 shé yǔ knomfū). In a harsh winter, a certain farmer went with a stuffed snake. Studying her, he took him home, putting her in a warm place. When he recovered his strength instead of thanking him for being saved, he attacked the poor unprepared man with the aim of injuring him. This, avoiding in time being bitten and repressing the fury, called the reptile to reason with calmly, asking him if that was how he treated a friend who had saved his life. The serpent, played by the proven goodness of the farmer, never attacked him again. Moral of the story that the Chinese tell their children: goodness pays off and can save not only bodies as souls.
The serpent symbolizes the divinity “guardian of the treasures of the earth” in 蛇守护宝藏 (shé shŏuhù bǎozàng), finding himself at the entrance of caves to watch over the infinite riches. The guardians are gigantic, endowed with a prodigious force, but also with deep and mysterious wisdom.  Anyone who tries to penetrate these caves will not achieve it as much as they have. Only someone very special, of heroic spirit and armed with virtuous wisdom will pass the proof, providing access to the treasures of the earth, not for its own enjoyment, but for the benefit of the community and/or humanity.
I end with my translation of another popular story, entitled “White Serpent, Black Serpent” (白蛇与黑蛇 Bái shi yǔi shé), which presents and summarizes and the need for both principles, Yin and Yang, always operate In equilibrium, being the black serpent, representative yin of mysterious and lunar force and the white, symbolizing the radiant force Yang energy, its counterpoint.
很久以前 ， 在一座隐秘的山中 ， 有两条神蛇 有两条神蛇 有两条神蛇 白蛇与黑蛇。白蛇象征纯洁与善良 生活在阳光明媚的山顶 生活在阳光明媚的山顶 守护着清澈的溪流与花草；黑蛇则代表力量与神秘 ， ，栖息在幽暗的山谷 ， 掌控着风暴与黑夜。
一天 ， 一场大旱袭击了山谷 ， 水源枯竭。白蛇认为 ， 只有靠善行和祈愿才能带来水 ， 而黑蛇则主张用力量召唤风暴来解决问题。两蛇因此争执不休 ， 各自施展法力 ， ，山中风暴与烈阳交替 ， 导致自然失衡 ， 生灵涂炭。在看到生灵的痛苦后 ， 白蛇与黑蛇意识到 ， 单靠善良或力量都无法真正拯救山林。它们最终联手 ， 白蛇用其善念唤来生命的春雨 ， 黑蛇用其力量引导水流重回山谷 ， 山林恢复生机 ， 两蛇也化作山中的守护灵。 (https://www.lingoace.com/zh/blog/story-for-the- Year-of-Snake/)
Once a large drought on the valley was slaughtered, exhausting all the sources and water reserves that existed there. The white serpent believed the power of its good deed and prayers to return, while the black serpent argued that only by invoking the strength of storms would the question be resolved.  The two snakes argued nonstop, each displaying and exercising their abilities, sometimes with violent storms, sometimes with they are scorching. This situation led to the loss of balance in nature and the miserable suffering of living beings. When both saw what they were suffering, they realized that if they just depended on the Benfazeja's or the blinds, they would not have to save that mountainous region. Finally, they combined efforts. The white serpent invoked the vital energy of spring rain and the black serpent employed its strength to let the waters flow through the valleys and mountains to recover life. And this is how the two snakes became the Guardian Spirits of the Mountain.

A study recently published in Janus magazine, from the Autonomous University of Lisbon, draws attention to the fact that Brazil is not properly enjoying the advantages that Macau can offer in the promotion of the Portuguese language, integrated into the country's foreign policy. “Brazilian Foreign Policy and the Quest to Promote Portuguese: Building Bridges Through Macau” [Brazilian foreign policy and the issue of Portuguese promotion: building bridges through Macau] is authored by João Simões, assistant professor at the City of Macau (UCM ) and Daniel Veras, professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, in Brazil.
“It is time for Brazil to have a more significant presence in Macao, not only through diplomatic channels, but also encouraging the involvement of several non -state actors, such as commerce and investment chambers, professional associations, Brazilian cultural centers, media organs , artistic and cultural foundations, among others ”, read in the article.
Thus, the authors consider that this set of partners could help Brazil “leverage the role of Macau as a generator of opportunities, something that Brazil has not yet fully enjoyed”, since this “reinforced presence in Macau would allow the consolidation of Existing partnerships between Brazilian universities and mainland China ”.
In addition, at the level of students, a more robust presence in Brazil in the MSAR could “bring Chinese students closer to Portuguese from Brazilian companies, reinforcing the connection between education and the business ecosystem of the great bay”, as well as to enhance the production of "Locally adapted didactic materials to the Chinese context and, ultimately, bringing Brazil and China closer to the unique environment that Macau offers."
Based on official documents and other studies on this theme, the authors consider that, in general terms, there is “the need for Brazil effectively to take advantage of Macau's strategic position to capitalize on these opportunities”. Noteworthy among the main points of this position is the fact that, in Macao, the policy of “a country, two systems”, being “an International Porto, an autonomous customs zone” and having “a simple and reduced tax regime”, is noted among Macao. , without forgetting the role of commercial platform.
Academics also refer to the “proper economic diversification plan for MSAR (2024-2028)” which “also offers opportunities, especially the promotion of key industries development such as traditional Chinese medicine, the modern financial industry, state -of -the -art technology and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) and culture and sports.
A weak bet
Regarding China, Brazil is also not exploring every opportunity, João Simões and Daniel Veras highlight. "Brazil's foreign policy has actively promoted the Portuguese language in certain geographies, but has not given priority to China, despite the importance of the bilateral relationship between the two countries."
It is stated that “the Portuguese language is expanding in China, but Brazil's participation is not up to its magnitude as the largest Portuguese-speaking country in the world”. It is argued that this “discrepancy is even more surprising if we consider that China has been Brazil's largest commercial partner since 2009”.
The study highlights Victoria Almeida's position on the origin of Portuguese teachers in China, which “historically the teaching of Portuguese in China was referenced teachers from Portugal”. Thus, “only recently teachers in Brazil became more predominant”, and one of the explanations pointed out to this is the creation of the reader program, which sends teachers to teach Portuguese worldwide.
The situation of this program is mentioned in 2010, when "13 readers were selected, two of which placed in China: one in Bisu and one at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies."
Still, "Brazil's didactic materials are scarce, and although there are Chinese students who want to go to Brazil, these opportunities are limited and the costs are high."
It is understood that Brazil “could take advantage of what is happening with the teaching of Portuguese in mainland China”, because “after years of rapid growth in the number of Portuguese apprentices, we are now in an investment phase in the so-called area studies. or regional ”. Thus, “Brazilian higher education and research institutions can contribute to the reinforcement of China's area studies on Lusophone and Latin America countries, through the investigation and analysis of social, economic, political and cultural dynamics of the target regions ”, Especially given the initiative“ a track, a route ”, is stressed by the authors.
Portugal does better
The study denotes that, despite the various exchanges between Brazilian and Chinese higher education, the truth is that “many more Chinese students return from exchanges in Portugal, whose best universities offer exchanges with Chinese students”, considering that “it will take a long time until that Brazil builds a teaching culture in China ”.
Thus, “compared to Brazil, Portugal has a greater framing in the teaching of Portuguese abroad”, providing “Teaching Programs and Scholarships for Chinese Students”, Master's and PhD level, without forgetting “Partnership with the Camões Institute ”. “Portugal also facilitates the acquisition of titles, as well as promoting the translation of Portuguese novels in China. On the other hand, Brazil does not make such a structured effort. As a result, currently, most Chinese Portuguese-speaking students tend to use European Portuguese as a base or at least as a reference, ”he says.
Thus, João Simões and Daniel Veras consider that “Brazil can capitalize on the current context, which encompasses several favorable factors, to adopt a more collaborative approach to the promotion of Portuguese language in China”.
The study states that, currently, Portuguese is spoken by more than 264 million people on five continents, and it is expected to rise to nearly 400 million people by 2050, with “the African continent responsible for the largest increase”, reinforcing The preponderance of Portuguese as one of the most spoken languages ​​in the southern hemisphere. In addition, Portuguese is an official or work language in 32 international organizations.
With the arrival of Lula da Silva to the presidency of Brazil for the second time, the authors consider that he “has tried an approach to China”, namely in the commitment to join the initiative “a track, a route” and the appointment “of a representative permanent at the Macao Forum ”. The academics cite another author's idea regarding the existence of “distrust and reserve that Brazil has shown over the years in relation to the Macao Forum”.
Greater involvement “can help to guarantee China access to vital resources and markets in Brazil and Africa, potentially contributing to China's food and internal energy security” as well as enhancing Macau as a “cultural channel between China and the World Lusophone ”.
However, “although there is political will and a favorable environment in Macau, more concerted efforts will be needed by Brazil to materialize these opportunities,” is referred to.</description><pubDate>2025-02-07 01:48:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese New Year | Tourism and trips boosted consumption</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/06/ano-novo-chines-turismo-e-viagens-impulsionaram-consumo/</link><description>Arrived to the end of Chinese New Year's holidays, official numbers do not lie: China has crossed an intense consumption period, especially related to travel and tourism. Between January 28 and this Tuesday, some destinations in the country broke records of visitors
 
It is at the beginning of each year that the economy awaits the one who is one of the high moments for tourism and consumption in China. The Chinese New Year represents not only a moment of family life, but also the opportunity for many Chinese to travel. This year, to celebrate the year of the serpent, millions of people traveled internally and also out of the country between January 28 and Tuesday, and according to Xinhua the numbers are impressive with regard to purchases or number of visitors in some Destinations.
The Altay City Hall, in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, is referred to as one of the great ski destinations in the country, having received between January 28 and 31 191,900 visitors, a tourist flow that generated 225 million yuan in revenues.
The agency points out that "skiing has definitely became the most popular activity in Altay during the holidays", leading to "a record number of practitioners, more than 10,000, to visit Jiangjunshan's ski resort on February 2". This represented "an increase of 23 percent over the previous year."
The Altay zone is famous for registering between 170 and 180 days of snow per year, and in the mountainous areas the average snow depth reaches between one and two meters.
Another region of China that reached considerable numbers on Chinese New Year holidays was Yangshuo County in the Autonomous Guangxi Zhuang region, thanks "to unique natural landscapes and rich cultural activities." Between January 28 and 30, this area received about 410,600 tourists, generating tourist revenues of 589 million Yuan.
In turn, Lhasa (in Tibet) also registered an increase in the number of visitors. Between January 28 and Monday, the city received 1.95 million tourists, representing an increase of 20.6 percent over the previous year, and found in tourist revenues almost 1.76 billion Yuan. This is an increase of 14.75 percent compared to the previous year, according to the Lhasa Municipal Culture and Tourism Office.
Positive data from agencies
Also according to Xinhua, the Chinese New Year's numbers also revealed themselves on travel reserve platforms. In the case of Fliggy, one of the main online agencies, "an increase in reserves, especially for cities such as Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou" was recorded. On the other hand, "international travel orders have increased significantly, with international cruise reserves increasing more than six times compared to the previous year."
Regarding air traffic, Shanghai Airport Group reported that passenger traffic on Sunday has reached a new historic record of 404,000 people, with Pudong Airport in Shanghai, to record 259,000 passengers and Hongqiao Airport 145,000 passengers.
There was also a “reinforced coordination of the services of metro, buses and taxis to ensure transport without problems” with the arrival of the end of the holidays, said the group.
On Monday, China State Railway Group Co., Ltd. recorded “a historic milestone” as they were transported on all railways a total of 16.45 million people. This is the “largest passenger traffic in a single day in the history of the Spring Festival Race”.
Only this Tuesday, the last day of the holidays, will have traveled 16.9 million passengers, a number that highlights “further the peak of travel, since hundreds of millions of people returned to their destinations after family meetings” .
Comes and Babies
As far as tourism is concerned, it was found “a growing number of people who sought to know the heritage of China, motivated by the registration of the Spring Festival in the representative list of UNESCO's Immaterial Cultural Heritage, in December 2024”, indicates the state agency.
Data from the Ministry of Commerce show that sales in major retail and restoration companies throughout China, during the first four days of holidays, increased 5.4 percent compared to the same period last year.
There was an increase in consumption of imported food and drinks, such as lobsters, beer and wine. "Due to increased demand during the Spring Festival, our company's imports increased almost 50 percent last month," said Yang Xinyu, who represents a company in the Guangzhou -based international supply chain.
Since January that the customs authorities of Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport have enlarged the importation of food products such as lobsters and crabs, 31.8 percent compared to 2024, translated the total of 14.3 million Yuan.
Many online shopping
And if the Chinese New Year is synonymous with family reunion, the holidays were once again a time for online shopping. Meituan, one of the country's leading electronic service platforms, has recorded an “impressive increase” of 300 percent over the previous year in online reserves for Lunar New Year's Eve dinners.
Note that "group orders for packages with the theme" intangible cultural heritage "have increased more than 12 times since January, year after year, reflecting the growing interest of consumers in cultural experiences."
Sun Jiashan, an associate researcher at the Central Academy of Culture and Tourism Administration, said, according to Xinhua, a change in consumer behavior, especially by young people and families. "Young families are increasingly becoming the driving force of consumption, with a tendency for diverse, high quality and culturally rich experiences," he said.
Meituan Travel data corroborate the analyst's observation that young people increasingly choose to celebrate the Spring Festival in smaller cities, plunging into intangible cultural heritage and historical landmarks.
The increase in tourism and cultural consumption, from equity experiences to successful films, indicate a growing demand for traditional and contemporary cultural activities. "This trend has also led to increased demand for cultural and tourist products and services, giving rise to the introduction of new models and business formats that adapt better to contemporary cultural consumption standards," Sun said, highlighting the potential of the Chinese consumer market and the internal driving forces of the economy.
But not only shopping was made this Chinese New Year, because "the country's film industry proved to be one of the biggest winners during the spring festival's consumer wave." Between January 29 and February 3, the ticket daily revenues exceeded billion yuans for six consecutive days, raising the ticket offices of this year's Spring Festival to 8.02 billion yuans,
According to China's movie administration data, China's total box office on this year's holidays, including real-time pre-sale, exceeded ten billion Yuan.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Denmark | PM Refusal Sell Grolândia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/04/dinamarca-pm-recusa-vender-gronelandia/</link><description>Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was yesterday available to dialogue with the United States over Granelândia, stressing that the autonomous territory "is not for sale."

The head of the Copenhagen government also recalled that Danish troops fought alongside the US for many decades.

The authors warn of the “long way to go regarding the promotion of sustainable tourism”
 
The Macao Tourism sector has changed in recent years and the visions of the tourists themselves as well, facing the territory as a place where one can walk and enjoy leisure zones, not as much as a game land. This is one of the conclusions of the “Tourism as A Driver of China's Cultural Soft Power: The Role of Macau and the Convergences Between The New Silk Road and the Greater Bay Area” [Tourism as the engine of China's Soft Power: The Role From Macao and the convergences between the new silk route and the Great Bay area], by Pedro Steenhagen, Fudan University, and Sofia Xiaoying Hou, linked to the Xi'an University of International Studies. Analysis of the tourism industry at MSAR is one of the chapters of the book “The Palgrave Handbook on China-Europe-Africa Relations”, recently edited.
Thus, it is concluded that “the perception of the image of Macau by tourists has been changing in the last 10 years, being the more and more seen as a place of leisure and vacation in general, and not specifically or purely as a game center. ” It is also added that “the image of masters as a tourist destination is in transition, and people visiting Macao have greatly valued their unique cultural attractions, including their architecture and gastronomy, the result of the mixture of Chinese and Portuguese cultures and inheritances” .
However, the authors consider that "Macau still has a long way to go regarding the promotion of effective sustainable tourism." It is understood that sustainable tourism “must fully take into account its economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, sector, environment and related communities”.
In this field, the authors highlight, quoting another author, that "Macau has made efforts to achieve good grades in these and other stories, as the tourism industry of MSA has been undergoing a" silent revolution "since the beginning of the pandemic."
It is also noteworthy that, worldwide, the International Tourism Organization has created some guidelines on sustainability, creating “an important framework of sustainable tourism”. For this, “five fundamental pillars were proposed to evaluate the sustainability of the tourism sector of a state”, such as “tourism policy and governance; trade, investment, data and competitiveness; Employment, decent work and training; Reduction of poverty and social inclusion; and sustainability of natural and cultural environments ”.
The Silk Route
The academics also analyze the role of the Macao tourist sector in the strategy of “a track, a route”, noting that the territory “has been gaining a prominent role in local, regional and external policies, being an actor capable of improving the Tourism Silk Route and streamline tourism in the Great Bay region ”.
Macau is understood to make new contributions to the way China presents its culture, because “due to existing heritage and tourist products, it presents the Chinese culture to foreign visitors through a new, more diverse lens that goes beyond traditional” . Thus, tourists are allowed, “especially in the Lusophone world, [create] a better connection and understanding of the country through common historical and cultural bonds”.
With regard to the Great Bay project, it is also considered that both this region and the territory of Macao have “actively integrated the tourism development strategies in the BRI frame”, ie “Belt and Road Initiative”, English designation for “a track, a route”.
Macao has “a diverse and distinct range of tourist resources, such as the arts, history, constructions and religious traditions, gastronomy, sport, museums, among others”, and local authorities have sought, according to the authors, “Mark its tourist industry, promoting 'Tourism+' with transfronic cooperation in the scope of bri”. The idea is to “create an image of Macau as a city with diverse cultures, integrating the sectors of tourism, entertainment, culture, sports, business, conventions and exhibitions, health care, recreation, technology and big events”.
IMPROVEMENTS ON COURSE
Pedro Steenhagen and Sofia Xiaoying Hou understand that the Macao government “has been trying to improve cultural soft power and increasing tourist attractiveness through product development, facilities improvement and advertising”, and “projects to improve Facilities such as hotels, restaurants, transport and digital tours. ”
The example of two digital pathways created by the Cultural Institute, namely, in 2021, “The House of the Family of Zheng Guanying” and also “Fortaleza da Guia”. Moreover, authorities have created several interactive platforms using increased virtual reality.
Despite all the efforts pointed out to the local authorities, it is understood that "masters still have an unexplored potential to reinforce cultural ties between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, and this decade may present great opportunities in this regard."
The tourist bet
In this chapter, the authors also look at the positioning of tourism in the initiative “a track, a route” by Beijing, given that “China has been increasingly paying attention to the need to expand its cultural soft power , both regional and global. ” Thus, the country "has formulated several cultural development plans associated with" a track, a route "and the area of ​​the great bay, and tourism has constantly appeared as an essential element of its global strategy.”
In the country "tourism has gained relevance, either as a means of improving international image and as a source of revenue." Only in 2018 “about 159 million visitors traveled to the country, which invested $ 155 billion in tourist infrastructure-a value behind the United States, but should become the first by 2028- since you saw the sector represent 11 percent of your total gross domestic product. ”
The authors argue that “by connecting and increasing the dynamics between BRI [Belt and Road Initiative] and the Great Bay area, with an interesting effort on the diversification of Macao's economy and strengthening its tourist sector, as well as among the objectives. National and regional, China seems to be finding a way to boost tourism and reap the fruits in terms of cultural soft power. ”
Thus, and in the long run, it is considered that the country “may not only grow the power of its narratives and culture, but also improve normative power and institutional positioning in the world scene, especially with regard to issues of governance ”.
It should be noted that the book “The Palgrave Handbook on China-Europe-Africa Relations” is edited by Yichao Li, Jorge Tavares da Silva, Carlos Rodrigues and Francisco José Leandro, from the University of Macau. The edition is in charge of Palgrave Macmillan.</description><pubDate>2025-02-10 00:56:28</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Trump will impose rates on “very soon” European products</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/04/eua-trump-vai-impor-taxas-sobre-produtos-europeus-muito-em-breve/</link><description>United States President Donald Trump said European products will be subject to “very soon” customs rates following the imposition of tariffs on the importation of products from Canada, Mexico and China.
“They are really enjoying us, we have a $ 300 billion deficit. They do not take our cars or our agricultural products, practically nothing, and we all bought millions of cars, huge levels of agricultural products, ”he said on Sunday to the press.
The European Union lamented on the same day the increase in customs rates by the United States of America about products from Canada, Mexico and China, and said it will retaliate strongly if it is targeted by unfair tariffs.
"The EU firmly believes that low customs rights promote economic growth and stability," the European Commission in a statement said through which he considered the imposition of more US tariffs as "harmful to all parties."
If the European bloc is also the target of these measures, the community executive will “retaliate strongly”. Donald Trump signed on Saturday the executive order to apply customs rates to products from Canada, Mexico and China.
The signature, which officializes the decision that had already been announced, determines the imposition of 10 percent rates to China, 25 percent to Mexico and 25 percent to Canada, except in Canadian oil, which will have a tariff of 10 per one hundred.
Trump had threatened the imposition of tariffs to ensure greater cooperation from countries to prevent illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals such as Fentanil, an opioid that is causing important additions in the United States. The three countries promise to take action.
Sacrifice (dis) necessary
In the case of the European Union, a decision has not yet been made, but the concern is general and France defended on Sunday a "scathing response" of Europe in the face of threats of new customs tariffs by the US President.
Trump admitted that the new tariffs can cause suffering to the American people, but has ensured that "everything will be worth it" because it will "make America big again."
“Will there be suffering? Yes, maybe (and maybe not). But let's make America big again, and it will all be worth it, ”wrote Donald Trump, in capital letters, on the profile of the social network he founded, Truth Social, quoted by the France-Presse news agency.</description><pubDate>2025-02-04 01:18:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Study | Greater life satisfaction associated with relationships and money</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/04/estudo-maior-satisfacao-de-vida-associada-a-relacoes-e-dinheiro/</link><description>A study that evaluates life satisfaction in 65 countries and regions, including China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, concludes that in all countries financial security and have a love relationship are key to happiness. However, during the pandemic there was a “great variability in global satisfaction”
 
What is necessary to have a full life with happiness? The question, which can have various connotations and spiritual trends, sought to be answered and quantified by the authors of the study “Life Satisfaction Around the World: Measurement Invariation of the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) Across 65 Nations, 40 Languages, Gender Identities, and Age groups ”[Life satisfaction around the world: Invariance on Life Sounding Scale (SWLS) in 65 countries, 40 languages, gender identities and age groups].
The study, recently edited by the academic magazine “Plos One”, started from analyzes made by dozens of academics and contributors in 65 countries and regions, including China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, which makes 57,000 people analyzed.
In general terms, the authors conclude that "in all countries a greater satisfaction with life was significantly associated with financial security and the existence of a relationship of commitment or marriage." Thus, the results indicate that “greater satisfaction with life is significantly associated with greater financial security and higher educational qualifications (which may be an indicator of socioeconomic status, although the dimension of this specific relationship was insignificant)) ”.
In general terms, “these results are consistent with the evidence that indicates that the satisfaction of basic human needs and material well-being is a strong-possibly the strongest-predictor of psychological well-being and life satisfaction and life specifically".
Admittedly, the authors draw attention to the fact that the idea of ​​well-being can vary from country to country depending on the culture of populations, but the results “suggest that, when considered at the individual level, the association between satisfaction with Life and indicators of material welfare seems to be relatively robust between nations. ”
Regarding relationships, the answers hung more to the importance of not being alone. “We found that marital status was significantly associated with life satisfaction. More specifically, we found that respondents in commitment relationships were more likely to report more life satisfaction than non -married. This result is consistent with the widest literature that shows that marital status is a robust correlate of psychological well-being. ”
However, a satisfactory life is not directly linked exclusively to love relationships, and can also occur when the person has an active social life. "It has been suggested that the formation and maintenance of social relations is fundamental to the promotion of life satisfaction, particularly in cultures or communities that emphasize family values, because they satisfy a basic human need for belonging and are a source of positive affirmation." . In addition, it "reinforces healthy behaviors and protects against the impact of negative events."
Thus, the study considers it to be "likely that people living in commitment relationships can report greater emotional support and social integration, which, in turn, contributes independently to life satisfaction."
COVID-19 TIMES
If socialization is regarded as very important to a satisfactory life, as it was in times of COVID-19, which forced long periods of confinement and isolation? The study resorted to specific and statistics to evaluate the issue, concluding that there was “great variability in global satisfaction with life in the context of Covid-19 pandemic. The respondents in Canada (Francophone) and Israel had the highest SWLs and respondents in Japan and Ukraine to have the lowest averages. ”
Given the large dimension of the sample, the results allow you to conclude “that life satisfaction varied substantially among national groups at the height of the covid-19 pandemic, although the authors highlight,“ care is necessary to be careful when interpreting them Latent averages ”referred to at work so as not to advance with definitive conclusions. Still, academics understand that these data may be important to when "professionals and political decision makers try to understand differences in life satisfaction between nations," as well as being a "way to better support subjective well-being in the era Postpandmic ”.
Also noteworthy is the least life satisfaction by the minority population groups. “We found that identification as part of a racialized minority was associated with less life satisfaction. Although this is consistent with some previous works and probably reflects the deleterious effect of the experiences of racism on life satisfaction, it should be noted that the dimension of the effect of this relationship was insignificant. ”
In addition, the authors point out that “urbanity was associated with life satisfaction in a little significant way”, having been evaluated if living in a city or other urban context changed the level of satisfaction with life.
Means and purposes
To reach data from the SWLS scale described above, the “Body Image Inquiry” (Bins, English) was made by 253 scientists or academics of the 65 countries involved, who collected data between November 2020 and February 2022.
In total, 56,968 people were interviewed, 58.9 percent were women, 40.5 percent men and 0.6 percent were of another gender identity. In terms of race and ethnicity, the majority, 74.2 percent, "identified as part of a racialized majority," while 11.3 percent "identified as part of a racialized or minority ethnic group."
Regarding the site where participants live, 27 percent said living in a capital, 13.7 percent in the suburb of a capital, 25.1 percent in a province city, that is, with more than 100,000 inhabitants; While 18.7 percent said residing in a province town with more than 10,000 inhabitants. Only 15.5 percent of respondents lived in a rural area.
As for literary qualifications, 33.5 percent ended higher education, 42 percent were single and 19.5 percent were in a “commitment relationship, but were not married”. In turn, 33.5 percent were married.
Regarding financial security, 24.9 percent of participants reported feeling less safe than others of their age in their country of residence, while 49.6 percent said they felt “equally safe” and 25.5 percent They considered to be "safer".
Inquiry data allowed the study authors to “examine associations between life satisfaction and the main sociodemographic variables at the level of the individual”. Factors such as “Life Satisfaction”, “Financial Security” and “Urbanity” were evaluated, in which participants filled SWLs using a 7 -point response scale, where 1 point represented “totally disagree” and 7 points "I totally agree." Demographic data such as age, education, marital status or race were also evaluated.

However, the work, published in a magazine of the State University of Bahia, points to the greater convergence of cultural characteristics
 
Chinese New Year and New Year: How are, what do they represent for the West and the East, and what are the points of convergence? It is to these questions that the study “Comparisons of cultures between Chinese New Year and Western Christmas” by Zhen Zhao, Yin Xuelu and Qiao Jianzhen intends to answer. Academic work was recently published in the magazine “Points of Interrogation - Journal of Cultural Criticism”, from the State University of Bahia, Brazil.
The authors highlight, in general terms, that "Christmas in the West is egocentric, exalts individuality and shows greater interactivity", namely with the "participation of the crowd" and demonstration of "passionate carnival emotions of people".
On the other hand, the Chinese New Year “is a national festival, clearly representative of contemporary Chinese society”. In general terms, this kind of celebrations emerges described as “a special sociocultural meaning that intersperses the daily routines”, “a concentrated exhibition of people's colorful life” as well as “a summary and extension of politics, economics, culture and religion from various regions, ethnic groups and countries. ”
They also describe the authors that the Chinese New Year, who can also be called the Lunar New Year or Spring Festival, has roots “in a small peasant economy and is often based on Confucianism, with a mixture of Buddhist and Taoist culture”, being linked to "feudal religious rituals."
In turn, Christmas is presented as a larger religious component, being "rooted in Western Christian culture and embodies the values ​​of freedom and equality, original sin and individualism everywhere."
Inevitable interconnections
However, the study describes as inevitable the future exchange of cultural demonstrations at these times of the year: in the case of Christmas, in December; In the case of the Chinese New Year, during the months of January and February of each year, depending on the calendar.
"The future exchange of Chinese and Western cultures, including the festival's culture, is an inevitable part of social and historical development," is described, as well as "an evolutionary process of complementarity between Chinese and Western cultures."
Thus, the authors say, the contact points should be discovered by both cultures “from the differences between the Chinese New Year and Christmas, so that they can be promoted” and so that there is a greater preservation of “their national cultures. ”.
The authors say they “the acceleration of cultural exchange between the East and the West” in this field, as “Chinese celebrate Western festivals and foreigners celebrate Chinese festivals”.
"In the age of globalization, and due to the development and deepening of economy and culture, traditional Chinese and Western parties have been gradually accepted by both peoples in mutual tolerance," reads.
Differentiating points
The three authors of the study recall that in China, the most traditional festivals have a connection with agriculture, with traditional customs based on food and drink. "The main reason for this is the pursuit of the Chinese people in going to be oriented to a long and healthy life." Meanwhile, "Western traditional festivals have mainly origin in religion and related events," therefore "strong religious connotations."
It is added that, in the West, “traditional vacation customs are based mainly on the subject of fun”, the main reason for “the pursuit of western ones in life to have the objective of health and happiness”.
In comparative terms, "both Chinese New Year and Christmas is a family reunion time and a wonderful time for people to look back and also to the future," although "with different connotations in Chinese and Western cultures."
One of the differences pointed out in the study is the way the days before these dates are celebrated. “The year's passage [in the Chinese New Year] is the time when people try to go home to their loved ones, no matter where they are. New Year's dinner is the highlight, also known as the reunion dinner, being the most important meal of the year. ”
One of the rituals goes through the sunset, “families start to light the rockets”, starting to prepare meals with this environment. “Although New Year's dinner dishes range from place to place, each dish has a certain symbolic meaning. Chinese like to use harmonics to attract good luck, and for example, chicken harmonics mean 'auspicious', while "yu" yu harmonics mean "year after year".
“New Year's Eve is a custom of the Chinese people Han. After eating the New Year's meal, people gather in family to wait for the coming of the new year at midnight, ”the authors point out, also describing that“ in many parts of China on New Year's night, People prepare sumptuous offerings, light incense and candles, pour wine and burn paper money, paying tribute to family ancestors to express nostalgia for them ”, as well as waiting for blessings“ for the sons and grandchildren of the sky, inspiring the descendants to work harder and live up to the desires of their ancestors. ”
In the case of Christmas, celebrated on December 25, the day before is marked by a family dinner that also has traditional dishes and sweets, such as the king cake, cod or roast turkey. “Unlike New Year's Chinese vigil, Westerners celebrate Christmas as a unique fantasy party on Christmas Eve who extends throughout the night. At the party there is no rigorous clothing code, just being natural and informal, climbing to say 'Hello' and sending sincere wishes [of good holidays], ”is mentioned.
Another differentiating point pointed out is the offers. If the Chinese New Year is usual the offer of money in the “Lai Si” envelopes, the western Christmas are present between family and friends.
The distribution of money in the Chinese New Year has several connotations, and there is a kind of money to the elders, serving “to wish them a long life”; While there is later the money given from the elders to the youngest, representing a care transmission from the most seniors.
In turn, “the first legends about Christmas gifts refer to the birth of Jesus,” with the offerings of the wise men. “It is currently customary to give gifts between family and friends at Christmas,” is mentioned, and there is also the idea that it is Santa to distribute the gifts. “Sometimes people pretend to be Santa Claus to give gifts to children in order to add the festive spirit,” he says.
Another big difference pointed out by the study is that in the West, Christmas does not have the same connotation as ancestors. “In the West people do not worship their ancestors, and people go to church to celebrate the birth of Jesus. People are not limited to being in family meetings, but inviting [others] in a warm way to their homes, and is not considered rude partying together. During the holidays many people participate in community activities to help the poor and give gifts, reflecting the idea of ​​seeking equality. ”
Similarity
According to the study, the two celebrations have as its common point to serve to "maintain social stability." “In ancient China agricultural production was strongly influenced by the climate. Poor workers who belonged to the lower classes often had to work all year round, which inevitably led to dissatisfaction with the reality of the situation. ” In this sense, the arrival of the Chinese New Year is “a good time to release emotions”, decorating the house and lighting rockets in the creation “hope that the next year will be good, with good harvests and better days”.
With regard to Christmas, it is described that people “go to church worship [the saints], sing Christmas songs and pray to God, hoping that they will help them get out of difficulties when they are in trouble or when they are sick and face death . They expect God to forgive them for the sins so that they can ascend to heaven after death, ”there is a parallel with the“ liberation of emotions ”above.
In addition, both celebrations constitute forms of culture transmission, according to the authors of the study. “New Year's culture is an accumulation of traditional Chinese culture, being the crystallization of the work and wisdom of the Chinese people, expressing the aspirations of the hardworking people who long for good things.” In addition, these celebrations “carry and convey traditional culture in a subtle manner”, namely with paintings and other decorations of houses, or events such as Dragon and Lion dances or handwriting sessions.
“Through these activities the extremely valuable cultural heritage is transmitted to younger generations,” is referred to. In turn, at Christmas there are the decorations of the time, with the tree, the lights or cribs, in green, red colors and other bright tones.
“People who have been busy working year returns to revive the family heat. People go to the church to celebrate the birth of Jesus, which is a regular event and an inheritance of religious culture. It has become customary to send a Christmas card to friends and family, and all these customs carry profound cultural connotations that are transmitted. ”</description><pubDate>2025-02-03 01:40:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Portugal Day | Marcelo in the celebrations in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/10/dia-de-portugal-marcelo-nas-celebracoes-em-macau/</link><description>Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa's passage has no date yet, but will fall into the celebration of Portugal's Day, Camões and Portuguese communities, in a year when official celebrations will take place in Lagos, Algarve, and then in Macao
 
The President of the Republic of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, will mark in Macau the Day of Portugal, Camões and the Portuguese communities, June 10, although the dates of the visit are not yet defined. The information was advanced during the weekend by Radio Macau, and later confirmed by Alexandre Leitão, consul of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong.
“It is the confirmation of information that in the consulate many honors us and I think that honors the Portuguese community. It is a gesture of recognition by the President of the Republic of the relevance and dimension of the Portuguese community, which as we know is not restricted to the Portuguese immigrants, expatriates, Portuguese from Portugal, but all those who have Portuguese nationality and live in Macau and that are many.

These are the questions I will ask if I have the opportunity to do so, ”he admitted.
Miguel de Senna Fernandes also considered that Portugal politicians tend not to know what is happening in the territory. "The politician always says that he is aware of what is happening, but there are nothing aware of what is happening in Macao," he said.

Deputy Ella Lei argues that the government should promote a better coordination of road works, to avoid traffic embarrassment that affect residents, as well as business in the areas of the work. The subject was addressed by the legislator linked to the Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom) through written interpellation.
According to the figures presented by the deputy, the coordination group of works on the roads of Macau has received 69 proposals for construction projects related to the government or the water companies, telecommunications or electricity, which represents an annual increase of 15 by one hundred. Among these projects, 39 will take place for more than 30 days in the main arteries of the city, a proportion that Ella Law indicated a 39 percent increase in the number of projects with great impact on traffic.
"Many groups of citizens are concerned about the current situation of road projects and expect the government to continue to improve the coordination and monitoring mechanism of projects," says the deputy. “For example, information about traffic deviations should be disclosed as soon as possible, even before the start of road projects, and residents' opinions should be continually heard in order to minimize the impact on business and travel of people, ”he added.
More information
In this context of growing constraints, the deputy asks: “Will authorities take more measures in the process of coordinating large road projects, such as optimizing global planning and supervision work, to solve long -term problems caused by road projects to residents? ”He asked.
Among the suggestions made, the deputy wants to know if the government will create an online platform to receive citizens' opinions, about improvements that can be implemented as long as the projects are taking place. On the other hand, Ella Lei argues that another easily accessible platform should be created with information about regularly updated works.
Ella Lei also appealed to the government to control the quality of the materials used in the works, and indicated that the use of unfair materials, which eventually damage the roads, is often used.</description><pubDate>2025-02-07 01:54:22</pubDate></item><item><title>The (in) justice we have</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/10/a-in-justica-que-temos/</link><description>For many decades we met a judge, we had studied together, who was homosexual. A magistrate of excellence, from professional virtuosity to all the introvert evidence, has never taken any less dignified attitude towards his subordinates and even severely condemned an admittedly homosexual individual who had sexually abused a minor. At that time it was a scandal if it came to know that the judge was homosexual and would certainly be expelled from the judiciary. One day he confessed to me that he had a single and secret companion almost his age. I pretended that I did not give importance to the outburst and always had the ease of obtaining important information about legal proceedings that the judge was kind to provide me as a journalist. My comrades were surprised how I had such credible court sources and even asked the origin. Obviously they never got any response on my part.
This comes by justice that in Portugal we have judges and judges of very high degree of competence, seriousness and independence. Absolutely incorruptible. And we have others who simply fulfill their mission with the aim of obtaining the greatest possible peculio. They are corrupt, they are maneuvered by the Lobis of Powerful Lawyers' offices and, unfortunately, if they are homosexuals take positions of a deplorable degree. They reach the point of warning the defendant suspected of domestic violence or sexual abuse of minors in order to know how much possible amounts can pay if they are acquitted at the time of trial. These facts have happened over decades. Before and after the military coup of April 25, 1974. Recently, we were all aware of the shameful attitude of Judge Rangel who was to the point of handing over to an internship lawyer the writing of the judgments that were distributed to him. These judgments, which rangel or neither read or only provided the intern the indications that he was in. As it would have to happen, Rangel was expelled from the judiciary.
Justice in Portugal has always been led by absurd corporatism, where no sovereignty organ had the power to intervene in structural change. Justice in Portugal these days,-not to mention the past where a trainee judge was left to obtain his promotion was seen by a clerk to have oral sex to a senior judge in his office-it is manifestly a justice for very rich citizens. No poor man has any chance of paying a lawyer so that his defense is worthy and fair. Of course we know the existence of unofficial defenders, who most often are little interested in the processes concerned, but justice that there are exceptions. We, from our own experience, had an exceptional unofficial defender, of a peculiar competence that dedicated themselves to the process as if they were receiving a lot of money.
Last week, the country was aware of a scandal related to a judge accused of paying poor minors for sex. A jubilant magistrate from the Azores paid 25 euros to minors each time he had sex. There is no memory that a magistrate was accused and investigated by the court of a crime allegedly of such seriousness. A man reported that the judge attracted minors for sex with ice cream and pizza and that the judge resorted to the prostitution of minors paying to have oral sex after approaching the minors on the street and who lived in precarious conditions. The judge will be tried for resorting to minor prostitutes. The conclusions of a case of this gravity can lead the Portuguese to think what would have been this judge's career. Would there have been maneuvered sentences in exchange for homosexual sex? Had the magistrate received amounts of money when they appeared in the bar of the defendants accused of violation of minors? Will the magistrate misrepresented judgments that accused sexual violators of minors? Everything can be considered in the face of ignoble behavior that came to public by a jubilated judge.
We are waiting for the best Portuguese magazine that addresses all social and judicial problems, “Justice with A”, directed by a great prestigious judge, will address this theme in a next edition. It turns out that the theme that involves incompetent, corrupt and now pedophiles cannot be unpunished and should be the target of the biggest debate on the part of society. Jubilated Judge Manuel Mota Botelho is now being tried for 16 crimes of resorting to the prostitution of minors. The crimes will have occurred between 2019 and 2023 in São Miguel, in the Azores. The Jubilee Judge is renovated but ended his career as Judge Counselor of the Court of Auditors, and this institution decided to call the Permanent Commission to analyze the situation of the Azorean Councilor accused of abusing six minors over four years. The Permanent Commission has the responsibility to establish disciplinary proceedings and apply sanctions.
It has long been asking for a structural reform of justice in the political sphere and nothing has been done. Corporatism remains a reality and the country is fed up with processing processes that take more than a decade to be completed, especially when it comes to "important" citizens. The important thing in court is that the day the laws are developed by honest people, the court will be done.</description><pubDate>2025-02-10 01:21:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao in 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/07/macau-em-2025/</link><description>After taking office as a sixth chief executive of Macao, Sam Hou Fai announced that in the next five years he would strive to realize the four great visions: "Macau founded in the rule of law, dynamic, cultural and happy." Will these four views be really realized in 2025, the first year of the new Government of MSAR?
To achieve these four objectives, RAE's sixth government has to actively engage with patriotic organizations for communication and exchange purposes, and take government officials to Beijing to listen to Xia Baolong's instructions, the Director of the Work Office Hong Kong and Macao from the Communist Party Central Committee of China and the Hong Kong and Macao affairs office with the Council of State. All of this will be necessary to prepare the first report of the Governing Lines of Action to be presented by the Sixth Government of MSAR.
Based on reports from all over, and changes from members of the Management Committee and the Executive Committee of the Deepened Cooperation Zone between Guangdong and Macao in Hengqin, it seems that the “integration of Macao and Hengqin” will probably be a priority topic of the future policies of RAE. This is because this is a national policy defined by the central government for the sectoral diversification of the Macao industry and for the efficient integration of Macau in the Great Guangdong-Hong Bay Kong-Macau.
Although the path has already been opened, to prevent Macao from becoming confused with any other city in the interior of China, the proposal of the four visions is undoubtedly necessary. The question that remains is how to reach them.
Firstly, about the view of “Macao founded in the rule of law”, some scholars believe that “the law should not just be a tool for the government to control society. If we want to speak of a rule of law, the people must also be able to exercise control over government action through the law; This bilateral supervision is what constitutes the rule of law. Otherwise, the “rule of law” would mean controlling the people through legal provisions.  Therefore, the concept of Sam Hou Fai of “Macao based on the rule of law” must be persecuted in the direction of the rule of law, and not through the formulation or alteration of legal documents to control the people and society.
As for the creation of the “dynamic Macao”, the key is to break the limitations of the region. Otherwise, the coming of more tourists will only make the whole city chaotic, moving away from the goal of becoming the world center of tourism and leisure. To increase the vitality of Macao, it is necessary to expand its territory.
Hengqin is no longer a new zone directly under jurisdiction in the city of Zhuhai to become a deepened cooperation zone built and run jointly by Guangdong and Macau province. The next step is undoubtedly moving towards the integration of Macau and Hengqin. Anyone with a basic understanding of public administration knows that having two power centers and two leadership teams often affects administrative efficiency and reduces its effectiveness due to the lack of unified authority. Therefore, when the central government fully transfer the administration of Hengqin to Macau, it should also be the time to materialize the "dynamic Macau".
Macau has only a few hundred years of history compared to the thousands of years of China's cultural heritage. But what makes Macau stand out among many Chinese cities? The sino-Portuguese cultural and religious fusion. The files of the Diocese of Macao, Synical Sheets, and “Files and Manuscripts of the Kong Tac Lam Macau Temple (1645-1980)” were included in the registration of the memory of the UNESCO world to ASIA and PACIFIC, which fully demonstrates to Singularity of Macao's culture. If this advantage can be used, transforming Macau into “Macao Cultural” should not be difficult
As for the “Macao Happy” view, it should be the main priority of the Government of MSAR. After pandemic, affected by several internal and external factors, Macau's small and medium -sized companies faced difficulties, and social progress lacks driving force, with the increase of suicide incidents. The Government of MSAR has the responsibility of preventing Macau, “governed by patriots”, becomes a tragic city. For Macao residents to feel happy, it is essential to concentrate not only in the material aspects, but also in their mental well-being.
With the strong support of the central government and Sam Hou Fai's efforts and his team, 2025 is expected to be the best year of the next decade.</description><pubDate>2025-02-07 02:28:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao in the year of the serpent and mass tourism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/06/macau-no-ano-da-serpente-e-o-turismo-de-massas/</link><description>“Today's Tourist in the Longer Pays Attention to Consolidated Elements - Heritage, Cultural, etc. - Which have traditionally beenteed in what has come to be called the tourist bubble, but flex from it in search of what he or she considers authentic. ”
Constructing The Tourist Bubble
Dennis R. Judd
Macau, a region known for its rich mix of Portuguese and Chinese cultures, has become a global tourist attraction point, especially in recent decades. Macao has a complex history influenced by various cultural exchanges. Originally a fishing village became a Portuguese colony in the sixteenth century, establishing commercial routes that connected Asia to Europe. Over time, Macau began to serve as a gateway to western traders looking for Asian products. The transfer of sovereignty to China in 1999 marked a new era, with the transition from colonial management to special administrative status under Chinese governance.
In the early 2000s, Macau learned of a significant development of his tourist infrastructure due to economic policies favorable to liberalization. The government encouraged foreign investments, which led to an increase in infrastructure for casinos and luxury hotels. This development has significantly diversified the economy, creating employment and stimulating rapid urbanization. As a result, Macao emerged as a reference destination not only for the game, but also to leisure and entertainment, attracting millions of tourists every year.
The year of the serpent, which occurs from twelve to twelve years and occurred on February 10, 2013, and is repeated this year can symbolize significant transformation and growth. During this period, Macao will record a tribute of tourists, mainly from mainland China, contributing to the local economy. The mass tourism model provided economic benefits, including increased GDP and job opportunities. However, the strong dependence on tourism, especially the game, puts risks to the economic sustainability of Macau. As the tourism industry grows, concerns are beginning to emerge as to potential long -term economic repercussions. The growth of the tourism sector leads to an increase in cost of living, which can create friction between residents and visitors. Inflation in housing and essential services affects local communities, which face the threat of being marginalized in their own territory.
Macau had long been to have implemented an urban planning on tourist activity and gastronomic script in the city's historic center with the closing of São João's sidewalk and Rua de S. Domingos from the corner with Travessa do Bispo to Rua de Pedro Nolasco da Silva or Rua do Campo and rehabilitating Travessa da Sé that offers visitors and residents a degrading environment with establishments that sell Chinese fast food food without any food quality control and hygiene with people sharing in banks and Squakes along the street the food containers, as well as the implementation of a plan of all the sinners of the masters where bacteria and viruses proliferate
Rua da Palha is invaded by piles from establishments that sell all kinds of Fast Food Chinese where the increasingly less artisanal almond biscuits predominate and the famous NATA Pastels (which invaded Macao and Asia and that the Encyclopedia Wikipedia mentions and we played https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egg_tart#cite_Note-7 “In 1989, British Pharmacist Andrew Stow and His Wife Margaret Wong Opened Lord Stow's Bakery In Colaane, Where They Sold Portuguese Tarts That Copied The Pastel .

[3] [10] ” - There must be a reflection on public consultation to classify the Pastel de Nata as part of Macao's intangible cultural heritage by the Cultural Institute. In 2011, the Belém Pastel in North Portugal known as Pastel de Nata was elected one of the 7 Wonders of the Gastronomy of Portugal, so the Portuguese Consulate General was also pronouncing this icon of Portuguese cuisine), for pharmacies, etc. (where the lace of the few available stores are at millionaire prices and that there is little or nothing in the revenues of stores that are compatible with sales and hence the constant opening and closing dance of establishments.
Does this market law of wild and unmistralled capitalism interest Macao and that Milton Friedman so well describes in “Free to Choose” about Hong Kong? Even in the absence of established price regime, it is nonetheless speculation and lead to the creation of real estate bubbles that we all know the consequences.</description><pubDate>2025-02-06 01:36:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Refreshing vulvar and shame</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/refrescantes-vulvares-e-a-vergonha/</link><description>Recently, a celebrity in Portugal has launched a product that has given to talk, generated numerous posts and even made some paint. It is an intimate bruma, suggestively called Pipy, available by 29.90 euros. The goal? Refresh and somehow empower women to feel good with their bodies.
I always suspect the media of certain products. This was undoubtedly created "to ask them." The usual criticism followed: feminists with the arguments of the custom-many of which I subscribe to soul and heart-supported by health professionals. These are recurring discourses, because reality persists: there is a whole industry that thrives at the expense of female insecurity. Society insists on generating a feeling of dedequation in relation to normal body processes. If you want to refresh your vulva, wash it with water-the effect will probably be the same.
In addition, products like this, created from an artificial need, can bring more problems than solutions. The vagina has a sophisticated cleaning system and doesn't need new formulas to “clean yourself better”. Interfering with this balance can cause pH imbalances, making the intimate zone more susceptible to infections such as candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis. And then, yes, smell and discomfort become a clinical problem.
 What bothers me is the discursive dance around these themes. On the one hand, there are those who see the existence of a product as an act of empowerment; On the other, there are those who, tirelessly, try to educate for a healthier relationship with the body. Now one thinks that there is a product is to empower the vulves, while others try to educate for happy vulvas. And we stayed like this. The latter preach for the deaf, and the first preach stupidity.
What is the discursive opportunity of these vaginal refreshing, what pedagogical opportunities are we waste? A sincere conversation about people's badness. Why do people feel the need to buy products to hide the natural smell of their private parts? Although manufactured, insecurity and discomfort are still real, touching a sensitive point of existence: the shame.
Shame is a complex emotional system, based on beliefs that have been blaming the vulves because they are as they are. Also based on millennial discursive traditions. In ancient Greece they explained that men had a less poignant smell than women, so they needed more delicate perfumes, and women perfumes that best covered their natural aroma.
Dealing with shame is not easy - it requires delicacy. Explain that this is a manufactured shame does not make it disappear by magic. Continuous experiences of understanding are needed so that shame dissolves and becomes a true state of empowerment. Pipy is pseudo-popping because it works like a fast, temporary relief for deeper insecurity. The discussions that we have watched also perpetuate ideological chapels, easy to predict, without great emotional and empathic depth.
This will be only one of many articles written about Pipy, but perhaps the only one with the modest purpose of claiming that shame is being seen and understood. We were taught to be ashamed of the vulva. To unlearn, to achieve real empowerment, we have to look at this shame with affection and understanding. This recognition would be a first step to collective liberation. Only then will we leave the vulves finally at peace.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Photography | Religion and beliefs are the subject of a new contest</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/09/fotografia-religiao-e-crencas-sao-tema-de-novo-concurso/</link><description>Today starts the sixth edition of the Photography Contest promoted by Somos - Portuguese Language Communication Association, and this time has as its main theme the religions and beliefs that exist in the world of Portuguese speakers. “Man and the Divine” is the theme that candidates photographers should follow in the name of a “greater understanding of different ideologies”

The sixth edition of the Macau Somos Association Photographic Contest! - Portuguese Language Communication Association (ACLP) wants to contribute to a “greater understanding of the different ideologies and creeds” between the regions where Portuguese is spoken, the organization told Lusa.
“The question of understanding is closely related to ignorance that persists between the various ideologies and creeds in the countries and regions of Lusophony. Through photography, we intend to explore this cultural and religious diversity, ”said Somos's president! - ACLP, Marta Pereira. Under the theme “Man and the Divine”, the contest, which starts today and takes place until March 10, wants to “promote coexisting dialogue between religions or traditional local beliefs,” he noticed.
"The images must capture the essence of devotion, contemplation and the profound connection between humanity and the divine or the transcendent," said the official, adding that "it is fundamental" that the works "allow a historical contextualization, reflecting the various influences cultural and religious that shape spiritual experiences in different regions ”.
Marta Pereira recalled that, in Macao, "the most practiced 'religion' is Buddhism, often associated with elements of other traditional Chinese beliefs and philosophies, such as Confucianism and Taoism." There is also a strong presence of "Christianity, brought to Macao by Catholic and Protestant missionaries."
“If we look at Brazil, candomblé, a religion of African origin, is based on the worship of nature and its soul, and is therefore considered soul. In Timor-Leste, the population still remains rooted in the cult of ancestors and belief in spirits, ”he exemplified.
To whom it is intended
The competition, defines the regulation, is intended “to all citizens of the countries and regions of Lusophony or residents of Macau” with work done in Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Macao, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome and Prince, Timor-Leste and Goa, Damão and Diu.
The assessment of the candidate works is up to a jury chaired by the Portuguese photojournalist in Macau Gonçalo Lobo Pinheiro and also with António Leong (Macau), Samba M. Baldé (Guinea-Bissau) and José Sena Goulão, Reinaldo Rodrigues and Alexandre Coelho Lima (Portugal).
The three winning images will be awarded prizes worth ten thousand patacas, seven thousand patacas and five thousand patacas, and honorable mentions can be conferred. In addition to the pecuniary prize, the first place will be contemplated with the trip and stay in Macao -if not reside in the territory -to participate in the opening ceremony of the usual exhibition of Somos -ACLP, to be organized later this year, and in ' Locally organized workshops.
In addition to the winning images, the exhibition completes other photographs selected by the jury “for its relevance or value” for the theme of the contest and “the purpose of the association of projecting the cultural dimension of Lusophony, as well as the role of Macao as a platform that unites China and the countries/regions of Portuguese Language ”, read in a statement from the Association.</description><pubDate>2025-02-09 17:24:44</pubDate></item><item><title>“I'm still here” highlighted in the Goya awards</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/09/ainda-estou-aqui-destacado-nos-premios-goya/</link><description>Walter Salles's “I'm still here” won the category of best Ibero-American movie in the Goya awards in a ceremony that attributed “Emilia Perez”, a work of Jacques Audiard involved in controversy, the title of best European film.
This is the first time that a Brazilian feature film has been recognized in Goya, and director Walter Salles, through a message read by Uruguayan musician Jorge Drexler, expressed gratitude for this “very special” award. He remembered, moreover, that the work is about the memory of a family “during the long night of the military dictatorship in Brazil”.
The film recalls the story of former deputy Rubens Paiva, who was arrested, tortured and killed by the Brazilian dictatorship in 1971, and his wife, activist and lawyer Eunice Paiva, who had to resume family life with her children, and who tried to complain justice for the death of her husband, whose body was never found. The lead roles are played by Fernanda Torres and Selton Mello.
Audiard
Also this Saturday, "Emilia Perez", by French director Jacques Audiard, won the award for best European film. The music film tells the story of a leader of a drug cartel who fulfilled the desire to make the transition to women.
The victory of “Emilia Perez” was announced during the ceremony in Granada, but the vote ended on January 24, a few days before the beginning of the contagonist's polemics generated by the protagonist, Karla Sofa Gastón, published for years, some with Racist content.
In these publications, released in late January by an American journalist, Gascon described Islam as a “focus of infection for humanity” and mocked the anti-racist movement after the death of George Floyd, African-American killed by police in 2020 .
The Spanish press had been speculating for some time about the possibility of Gascon, who had to cancel his presence at various events in the United States, attend the Goya ceremony. But the actress, who lives near Madrid, eventually did not move to Granada.
“Emilia Pérez” hit the record for the non -English language movie more appointed to the Oscars, with 13 nominations, among which for better film, international film, realization, photography direction, main actress and secondary actress. The feature film, which has been a success since the presentation in the Cannes Film Festival, has been the target of another controversy in recent weeks, this time in Mexico, where it was criticized for lightly appropriating tragedies linked to drug trafficking .
Still in Granada, Spaniard Marcel Barrena's “El 47” was the film that raised the largest number of awards, in a total of five goyas (film, secondary actor, secondary actress, production direction and special effects).

Environmentalist Joe Chan Chon Meng told Lusa that it is “absolutely impossible” Macau to reach the goal for electric vehicles in mainland China, from 45 percent of new sales by 2027. In early January, the Chinese government released a list of objectives Environmental, which includes a rise review of the previous goal for electric vehicles, which was 20 percent by 2025.
In the second half of last year, the tramful ones represented more than half of the sales of new vehicles, according to data from the China passenger automobiles association. In Macao, 31.4 percent of the new vehicles recorded in 2024 were electric, according to official data. But the president of Macau Green Student Union stressed that fossil -powered vehicles “continue to represent a great proportion” of the territory park.
At the end of December, Macau had a total of 253,182 vehicles, of which 12,302 vehicles (4.8 percent) were existing electric, according to the direction of services for traffic issues (DSAT). Still, Joe Chan stressed that in recent years, the government has implemented several measures to promote less polluting transportation, including the creation of more loading spaces for electric vehicles.

At the end of 2023, Macao had 2,100 electric charging places for light cars and 500 for motorcycles, indicated the direction of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) on his portal.
Authorities launched in 2023 a financial support plan for the slaughter of obsolete motorcycles and new electrical motorcycle replacement of a maximum of eight thousand patacas. According to DSAT, in 2024 Macao had 128,542 motorcycles, and only 3.5 percent were electrical, an increase of 1.4 percentage points over the previous year.
Joe Chan suggested that authorities start by restricting heavy goods from goods, namely those used in construction, and public transport, "since Zhuhai [the city neighboring Macau] and border zones use natural gas and electricity." On Wednesday, DSAT officials told Radio Macau's Chinese channel that there are 929 new energy buses in operation, representing more than 92 percent of the total, while the proportion of more polluting buses descended to about 3 percent.

"However, when it comes to highly polluting vehicles, such as trucks and heavy motorcycles, authorities have not yet defined a very clear calendar and deadline for their progressive elimination, so pollution [they cause] is high." , lamented the environmentalist.</description><pubDate>2025-02-10 01:10:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Housing | Average price dropped 11.7% in 2024</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/10/habitacao-media-de-precos-caiu-117-em-2024/</link><description>In 2024, the global average housing pricing index descended 11.7 percent, compared to 2023, according to data released on Friday by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC).

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - Madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unambiguous moral implication in the phrase “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is managed to seek a reason for Things abroad to us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicidou -If and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ that had not entered the story. »
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when you announced the Nobel Prize in this year's literature, I couldn't help but remember this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, compared to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large newspaper Daily National Wrote wrote Five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize of Literature was awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete unknown. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners - I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example - but that only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone is He knows and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from him.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I also preferred that in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have been awarded. Les années ”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday an article came out in Maputo's morning “News”, to realize that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho Award Coast.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification as to their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained the guts to the dogmas of the "modern". For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but to be highlighted simply that we "we do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funeral trips for countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - which starts still awaits us, that secret spells we will still have to overcome, what horrors will be erected before our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the midst of Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneousness and frankness were coarcet in relationships in relations Human, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a "essence", therefore declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, "one and absolute". Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-of-life ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, no longer having pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as António Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter My Dear Friend: You are a pure, excellent and very noble poet, but one Also victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I malice.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people, who always seems the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters At eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Evidently, they are the two 'Bigger Than Life', but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my rank of hatter at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and Treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

"US measures are absolutely inconsistent with the relevant WTO rules and ignore our separate customs status," Hong Kong government spokesman said in a statement. The territory executive "will formally initiate procedures in accordance with the WTO litigation resolution mechanism against US irrational measures to defend our legitimate rights," he added.
Last Thursday, Hong Kong's Secretary for Economic Trade and Development, Algernon Yau Ying-Wah, had already said the city was considering resorting to the WTO. Algrenon Yau condemned in a radio program the imposition of an additional 10 percent tariff on imports from the territory, classifying the irrational measure.
"It is a disrespect for the region status as a member of the WTO and Autonomous Customs Territory," he said. "Washington made a significant mistake by imposing these tariffs," he warned, installing the White House to "approach the decision with prudence." The secretary said that over the past decade, the United States have registered a commercial surplus of more than $ 270 billion with Hong Kong, underlining the benefits of bilateral trade.
In addition, he said that exports from the former British colony to the country represent only 0.1 percent of the total, suggesting a limited impact of new customs rights. Yau noted that in recent years, Hong Kong has diversified its markets, such as Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central Europe, to mitigate “the repercussions of geopolitics”, allowing local companies to adjust export strategies.</description><pubDate>2025-02-10 01:25:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Hamas | Five released Thai hostages return home</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/10/hamas-cinco-refens-tailandeses-libertados-regressam-a-casa/</link><description>Five Thai hosts released by Hamas arrived in Bangkok yesterday, 16 months after they were kidnapped by the Palestinian Islamite group in Israel, international agencies reported.

The summit occurs at a time when Cairo gathered regional support against President Donald Trump's plan to transfer the inhabitants of Gaza to Egypt and Jordan, and place Palestinian territory under the control of the United States. The announcement of the summit coincided with the departure of Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty to Washington, where he is expected to meet high employees of the Trump administration and members of the congress.
The purpose of the visit is to “strengthen bilateral relations and the strategic partnership between Egypt and the United States” and “make“ consultations on the regional situation ”, according to the ministry, quoted by the French agency AFP. Trump launched last week the idea of ​​the United States to rebuild the Gaza Strip, devastated for 15 months of Israeli bombing, and making a "Riviera of the Middle East."
The plan, applauded by the Israeli government, would imply the move of more than two million inhabitants from the Gaza range to Egypt and Jordan. Trump's proposal raised a choir of protests around the world, particularly from the Arab countries, which insisted on the need for a solution of two states, Israelite and Palestinian, to resolve the Israelo-Palestinian conflict.
Rejected plans
Egyptian diplomacy said the summit was summoned at the request of the Palestinians after consultations "at the highest level with the Arab countries in recent days." Contacts were established in particular with Bahrain, which currently holds the president of the Arab League, the ministry added.
The head of Egyptian diplomacy had kept conversations on Friday with Jordan partners, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates to adopt a united position, rejecting any forced travel from Palestinians. The war between Israel and Hamas was triggered by an attack by the Palestinian extremist group on Israeli soil on 7 October 2023. The conflict was interrupted by a ceasefire agreement that came into force on 19 January, which provides for the exchange of Israeli hostages by Palestinian prisoners.</description><pubDate>2025-02-10 01:22:43</pubDate></item><item><title>SICHUAN | Relief teams look for missing landlords</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/10/sichuan-equipas-de-socorro-procuram-desaparecidos-em-deslizamento-de-terras/</link><description>Chinese rescue teams were looking for about 30 people in Sichuan province in the southwest of the country, after a landslide sliding 10 houses.

Speaking to Lusa, at the company's headquarters in Dili, Lourenço de Oliveira explained that he decided to open the route because it “represents a large market”, taking into account the thousands of Chinese living in the Timorese territory.
But, he stressed, also because when he started flying to Bali, Indonesia, and then to Singapore, the Chinese community asked him to make a direct route. "The process was not easy," said businessman Timorese, but February 14 marks the beginning of the flight to Xiamen, the city of Fujian Province, southern China.
The connection between the two cities takes about 05:20 hours and the round trip will cost about $ 1.060. Asked by Lusa about whether the expansion of the company includes air calls to Australia, Lourenço de Oliveira said he is already “submitting the documents”.
"If they approve, I have plans to make the Dili/Darwin and Dili/Melbourne route," he said. Lourenço de Oliveira also said that the company's future is successful, especially if Timor-Leste is admitted as a full member at the Association of Southeast Asia Nations, a process that the authorities expect to complete during this year.
Limited conditions
Created in 2023, Aero Dili made its inaugural flight to Denpasar, Bali, in March of the same year, and currently flies every day to the capital of that Indonesian island. Last year he started the connection to Singapore with a weekly flight and also has several weekly calls to Oecussi, Timorese Enclave located on the Indonesian side of the island.
The only financial support Aero Dili receives from the Timorese government is a monthly $ 50,000 compensation to fly to Oedusi. “Still, I also have to give a subsidy of $ 7,500” to keep ticket prices affordable, said Lourenço de Oliveira. Asked by Lusa about if she has already asked for an increase in compensation to the government, Lourenço de Oliveira explained that she never asked, but stressed the route to Oecussi is running "very well".
“But it is good anyway and has a good airport, it could be in Dili. If I could change the airport, ”he said, noting that works at Nicolau Lobato International Airport are“ very important ”, especially the increase in the track, which is small. Aero Dili's executive director explained that it has conditioned operations because it cannot use larger aircraft. Aero Dili has two planes, the second is scheduled to arrive in March.
"I'm in need of another plane to meet the criteria," said the businessman, noting that for Singapore is planned to hold two weekly flights and awaits the signing of an air agreement between Timor-Leste and Thailand to start also fly to that country.
The Timorese businessman said he decided to form Aero Dili, because after more than 20 years the country did not have a national flag airline, although before operating the air calls between the capital Timorese and Bali with 'charter' flights. “I started forming human resources and now we already have 22 two flights, three pilots, three more because of Airbus, which are now also flying, and I formed the government people in civil aviation, because if we have no inspector, we cannot collaborate ”Said Lourenço de Oliveira.</description><pubDate>2025-02-10 01:17:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Panama | Beijing presents protest by departure from the initiative track and route</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/10/panama-pequim-apresenta-protesto-por-saida-da-iniciativa-faixa-e-rota/</link><description>Trump administration pressure forced the Panama government to abandon the Chinese project of global infrastructure. Beijing says “deeply regret” the decision
 
China presented a formal protest to the Panama Ambassador in the Asian country, Miguel Lecaro Bárcenas, by the Panamiana decision of not renewing Beijing cooperation in the track and route infrastructure project, the Chinese authorities said on Saturday. Chinese Foreign Deputy Minister Zhao Zhiyuan told Lecaro Bárcenas on Friday that Beijing "deeply regrets" the decision of the Central American nation, according to a statement issued on the Chinese Foreign Ministry portal .
In the context of the track and route initiative, the official noted, "the practical cooperation between China and Panama in various domains developed rapidly, achieved a series of fruit results and brought tangible benefits to the nation and the Panamian people."
“Retrocede (…) goes against the expectations of Chinese and Panamian peoples and does not favor the vital interests of Panama,” said Zhao. The leader emphasized that China "respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Panama and argues that all large or small countries, whether equal, respect each other and fulfill their promises."
"China is firmly opposed to the United States efforts to deliberately undermine relations between China and Panama," added Zhao, expressing hope that "Panama makes the correct decision based on the general situation of bilateral relations and interests In the long run of both peoples, eliminating external interference. ” Miguel Lecaro Bárcenas said, in turn, that Panama “attributes great importance to relations with China”, according to the Chinese diplomacy note.
Exterior pressure
The president of Panama, José Raul Mulino, officially announced the removal of the country from the initiative track and route last Thursday. The announcement was made shortly after the visit to the Central American country of the US Diplomacy Chief, Marco Rubio.
Mulino said the Panama Embassy in Beijing "presented the document" to "announce the withdrawal with a 90-day pre-advice," as agreed between the parties. Marco Rubio described Panama's decision as an “important step” to reinforce relations with Washington. At stake are US concerns about China's influence on the Panama Canal.
Hong Kong Landbridge Group companies and CK Hutchison Holdings currently operate ports at both ends of the channel. This presence arouses concerns about the possibility of double civil and military use and strategic maneuvers, given the increasingly profound presence of the Asian country in Latin America.
The track and route initiative includes the construction of ports, railways or motorways, creating new commercial routes between East Asia and Europe, Africa or Latin America. Designated by Chinese President Xi Jinping, as the “Project of the Century” in 2013, the initiative was initially presented in Kazakhstan as a new economic corridor for Eurasia, inspired by the old silk route.
The project became, however, in the main program of the XI foreign policy. In the last decade, more than 150 countries around the world have joined the track and route.</description><pubDate>2025-02-10 01:15:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong considers the WTO against “excessive tariffs”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/07/hong-kong-pondera-recorrer-a-omc-contra-tarifas-excessivas/</link><description>The Hong Kong government announced yesterday that it is considering submitting an appeal to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in response to the “excessive rates” imposed by the United States on products from the Chinese semi -autonomous region.

Finally, he highlighted the resilience of the business sector of the special administrative region, which has trading chambers prepared to face the challenges that arise in this context.
Counterprise
China has taken US Customs Rights to the WTO and both parties now have the possibility of resolving the dispute through bilateral negotiations within the next 60 days.
After this period, the parties have the right to request the WTO the formation of a panel to resolve the commercial dispute. However, the decision of this committee may take months or even years, if one party appeals to it.
On Tuesday, Beijing announced the application of customs rights of 10 to 15 percent to certain US products, in retaliation of customs rights imposed by the United States to import Chinese products. China has also announced new essential mineral export controls and has launched an investigation into monopoly practices against the Google US technological giant.</description><pubDate>2025-02-07 02:32:02</pubDate></item><item><title>India | Parliament suspended for protests against US abuse to deported</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/07/india-parlamento-suspenso-por-protestos-contra-maus-tratos-dos-eua-a-deportados/</link><description>Yesterday's session of the Indian Parliament was suspended by protests by deputies against the alleged abuse inflicted to 104 migrants deported by the United States and who arrived on Wednesday to the country.
The migrants were taken from the United States to a northern town of India on a military plane, as part of a deportation vacancy decided by the new president, Donald Trump, but the treatment to which they were in such a way as Indian deputies that yesterday, Many shouted protests in the middle of parliament and demanded a debate about the deportations.
According to deputies and media, the arms and legs of the deported were handcuffed while on the plane, although the trip took more than eight hours, and were only released at Amritsar airport in India.
A treatment that the deputies considered degrading, noting that "handcuffed and with their legs chained [the migrants] had difficulty using the bathroom."
Parliament President Om Birla tried to calm the deputies, saying that the transportation of the deported was a matter of US foreign policy and that the United States “also have their own rules and regulations”, but did not prevent demonstrations inside and Outside the hemiciclo requiring a government response.
Some of the deputies who protested on the street used handcuffs and wielded posters that said, "Humans, not prisoners," while Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wrote on social network X that "Indians deserve dignity and humanity, not handcuffs."
His message was accompanied by a video showing one of the deported, Harvinder Singh, saying they were all handcuffed and had their feet chained for 40 hours. “We didn't let us go out an inch of our places. It was worse than hell, ”he said.
New Methods
The US usually makes trade and chartered flight deportations, but the use of the army to return people to its home country is a new method, which began in Trump administration.
Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar advanced to the High House of Parliament that US regulations allow the use of restrictions since 2012, both on military and civilian flights and ensured that US authorities reported that women and Children are not handcuffed.
Jaishankar has argued that while the government is talking to US authorities to “ensure that deported deporteds are not mistreated,” India's focus must be in the repression of illegal migration.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Washington next week, but the theme has already been addressed in a telephone conversation between Trump and Modi held last week. During the conversation about migrants and deportations, Donald Trump stressed the importance of India to buy more security equipment manufactured in the United States and have a fair bilateral trade.
The US Border Patrol has detained more than 14,000 Indians on the Canadian border between the end of September 2023 and the end of the same month last year, which represented 60 percent of all detention along the border and a number 10 times greater than registered two years ago.
According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of India, 15,668 Indian citizens have been deported from the US since 2009. A PEW Research Center report said that in 2022 India was in third place - after Mexico and El Salvador - on the list of countries with the largest number of unauthorized immigrants - 725,000 - living in the US.</description><pubDate>2025-02-07 02:29:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Ricardo Clara Couto, author of the documentary about Francisco de Pina | The weight of the guilt that persists</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/ricardo-clara-couto-autor-do-documentario-sobre-francisco-de-pina-o-peso-da-culpa-que-persiste/</link><description>“Francisco de Pina - The Portuguese who wrote the future of Vietname” tells the story of Father Jesuit, born in Guarda in 1586, who made the romanization of the Vietnamese alphabet. The documentary, by Ricardo Clara Couto was funded by RTP2 and aired at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center
How did you come across this character in Portuguese history in the East?
My brother, named Filipe Pires, traveled for Vietnam for a while and when he arrived from the trip he told me that he had to know the incredible history of the Jesuit Francis of Pina who had made the romanization of the Vietnamese alphabet, providing freedom and cultural independence tremendous. I was a little skeptical at first, because I found it strange no one to know this in Portugal, but I started my research on the subject and discovered a university study of a Franco-Vietnamese teacher who teaches in Madeira. I then confirmed that the idea that my brother had brought from Vietname was correct. From there, I tried to discover the origin of this priest, the work he had done, and realize why there was so little knowledge about Francisco de Pina in Portugal.
In addition to being a Jesuit missionary, can you highlight some biographical points that help you understand your legacy?
In the documentary I did not have the time to be able to take a more exhaustive biographical approach. I focused on the part where he arrives at Vietname. We talk about a man with an incredible culture and a desire to acculturate and be acculturated. A man who was a musician and was easier, thus learning the Vietnamese, which is a six -tone language. Deep down, despite being a Jesuit priest, he had the first of course culture and not so much religion. This, for me, is a reason for huge admiration. For him the essential objective of evangelization was secondary, because, for him, if we could not understand the culture of Vietnam, we could not teach the Vietnamese people. It was more important to deepen local culture and language, making it possible to be able to explore the most religious part. It was also a man who had a hard time when he arrived at Vietname.
Why?
There were some internal wars before some local gentlemen of the regions who did not agree with the mission of the priests. This is not explored in the documentary, but in fact Francisco de Pina even made some steps [for the Jesuit mission], as priests were not totally accepted everywhere. He eventually took refuge in a Japanese neighborhood and, from there, built his base.
Francisco de Pina, like what happened to many Jesuits at the time, was training in Macau, at the College of S. Paulo. How was it influenced by this period spent in the territory?
There is not much information about this time. It is known that it was indeed formed in this college, as was the case with many Jesuit priests at the time, but then went to Japan. Only then go to Vietname. So far, there was nothing of great relief in the life of Francisco de Pina, who followed the normal way. Japan was already expelling the Jesuit priests and it is in this context that goes to Vietname. The only most prominent thing about this period is that the 14 ships that left Portugal to arrive in Macau this year remained only three, and the ship where I was Pina Francisco was one of those who survived the storm.
Do you consider that your great legacy was the romanization of Vietnamese? What are the great contributions of this process in linguistic terms?
It is a giant contribution. If we think that even in the romanization of the language, Vietname was very dependent on the Chinese alphabet, and could not have cultural, linguistic and economic independence as well. After the romanization of the alphabet it was possible for Vietname to grow in these domains and have her own identity. The country has grown a lot to this day, because without writing a tongue passes only to the new generations of mouth in mouth, and the legacy of Francisco de Pina also remains today. The Vietnamese people are very grateful to this, and the proof is that two years ago a delegation of the Vietnammemesse Language Foundation Foundation came to Portugal and offered a monument to Guarda City Council (see Caixa) in honor of Francisco de Pina. However, I was surprised by the fact that the Vietnamese, and we talked about full -sided academics, know the story, the figure of Francisco de Pina, existing in the country several references. But in Portugal it is a little known figure.
How do you explain this?
I think this will have to do with the need Portugal has to make its catharsis about this period of history. Portugal was a completely different country from Africa to the East, and completely different from Africa to the Americas. But, however, there is this weight of guilt. Portugal cannot talk about this period of time, despite having a rich history between Africa and the East, but this time is not very approached because the country has not taken over what happened and, therefore, cannot talk about this period. Therefore, so much of the rich history of Portugal is unknown to the Portuguese.
How was the research process for the documentary?
I quickly arrived at the study of Professor Minh Ha Nguyen Lo Cicero of the University of Madeira, and with her we went to the roots of the Vietnamese language. When I discovered it was amazing, because it is part of the Vietnamese alphabet romanization triangle, as it is Franco-Vietnamese. Until recently, the official version that existed was that Alexandre de Rhodes, French Jesuit, had romanized the alphabet, later registering it in the Vatican and saying that it was a work in honor of his master, Francisco de Pina. However, the name of Francisco de Pina disappeared. From here we passed to the nationalist French official narrative that the romanization of the alphabet had been made by French because Vietname was a French colony. Then I also arrived at Professor António Morgado. The remaining contacts were made at Vietname, linguists, university professors and language specialists, especially in writing, who later joined the documentary.
How would you describe the Vietname of the time of Francisco de Pina?
It was very fragmented. They have a very their own culture that existed through a writing with Chinese hieroglyphics, but deals with Vietnamese, which led only 1 to 3 percent of the population to read and write. With the romanization this percentage increased exponentially, and with this the culture developed with the populations, united them more around common writing. I think this has made Vietname more modern and prepared to integrate into the rest of the world by having a more affordable language.
Do you feel it will help unravel this part of the history of Portugal, as well as the history of the Jesuit mission itself?
I hope so. Portugal seems to have a certain fear and shame to talk about this time, and proof of this is that this Vietnamese people came to Guard to offer a monument and practically did not come out of the subject. In addition, the representatives of the Vietname delegation were a little admired for not being received at an official level, except for the mayor of Guarda. I, who was invited by them to be present, felt a little shame of others, because Vietname came to Portugal to offer a monument and this is viewed as a secondary event, which is not. It would be important to make known this priest and this made to the country and the world, because Portugal and Vietnam have a very close and rich cultural history, as with Japan and China. But this is a little known aspect of the Portuguese people and [this documentary] can be a good opportunity for the country to make their catharsis.
Vietnamese artist sculpture resembles Francisco de Pina at Guarda
In November 2023, the Vietnamese Language Foundation offered the city of Guarda the sculpture “Nova Estela” by Vietnamese artist Nguyen Huy Anh. The work can be seen in the Garden of the Eduardo Lourenço Municipal Library. According to news from the agency Ecclesia, the event took place under the celebrations of the 824th anniversary of the attribution of Foral by King D. Sancho I to the city. “This is a posthumous tribute to Father Francisco de Pina, a Guarda-born Jesuit priest in 1586, whose religious path underwent a mission in Vietname, where he lived nine years of intense missionary activity, linguistics and of interculturality, ”said the Diocese of the Guard, in a statement.
According to the same note, the missionary Francisco de Pina was responsible for the introduction of the Latin alphabet and diacritical signs in the transcription of the sounds and tones of the Vietnamese language, which used, in writing, Chinese characters.
The priest embarked for over 400 years at the Nau de Nossa Senhora do Mount of Carmo, having completed the training at the São Paulo College in Macau and received the priestly ordination in Malaca. It was then called to the newly created Mission of the Jesuit Cchinchina, a zone that corresponds to the central part of the current Vietname. “He never came to the city where he was born and now returned in a bronze -carved boat by Vietnamese artists brought by the distant Vietname sea. From now on, Father Francisco de Pina will be in the historical memory of the guard and its inhabitants, materialized in this boat that brought him back to his city, leaving the name of the guard far, also written in Bronze letters ” , concluded the diocese.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 00:46:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Francisco Leandro, author and professor at the University of Macao: “Support from the country reinforces the role of Macao platform”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/16/francisco-leandro-autor-e-professor-na-universidade-de-macau-apoio-do-pais-reforca-o-papel-de-plataforma-de-macau/</link><description>Gang Wen interview with China Daily newspaper
Francisco Leandro, an associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Macao, states that the nation's support has allowed the MSA to serve as the Center for Commerce, Investment and Cultural Interactions between China and Portuguese Language Communities.
 
 
How do you see Macau's development since your return to the homeland? Among the city's achievements, which ones impressed him most? What about its sector, has there been an important progress in the last 25 years?
The 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the homeland and the creation of the Special Administrative Region of Macao is a significant milestone in the history of the region, reflecting a successful diplomatic process and demonstrating its current political and economic stability. Currently, RAE de Macao enjoys political stability and is deeply integrated into national development plans. The governance of the city under the beginning of “a country, two systems” allowed him to maintain a high degree of autonomy, while aligning himself with national policies. This integration facilitated Macao's economic growth, making it a vital part of the country's broader economic strategy.
Macao's socioeconomic development strategy is consecrated in the policy “a center, a platform, a base”. This picture aims to position MSA as a world center of tourism and leisure, reinforcing its attraction as a global tourist destination. In addition, MSAR acts as a platform for economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, promoting international trade and cultural exchange. Rae de Macao is also becoming a base of exchange and cultural cooperation, promoting cultural interactions and the conservation of heritage. This multifaceted approach supports Macao's integration into national development plans and reinforces its global presence. The unique position of MSA as a bridge between China, in particular the great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay, and Portuguese-speaking countries underline their strategic importance.
The concept of “a platform, three centers” enhances Macao's role in promoting economic and cultural exchange. This platform allowed the city to serve as a platform for trade, investment and cultural interactions, reinforcing the ties between China and the Lusophone world.
Macau's development as a tourism and leisure center, along with the promotion of four main industries - conventions and exhibitions, cultural and creative industries, traditional Chinese medicine and modern financial services - diversified its economy. These initiatives not only boosted economic activity, but also reinforced the global attraction of Macau as a tourist destination.
The central government adopted a series of policies for Macao. Is there any specific measure that has benefited your sector? As?
The interior of China and the Macao Economic Economic Partnership Agreement (Cepa) play a crucial role in the great bay and in the promotion of ties with Portuguese -speaking countries. By promoting commercial and economic cooperation, the strain reinforces the position of MSA as a bridge between China and Lusophone countries. This agreement facilitates access to the market, investment and cultural exchange, promoting Macao as an international business center. In addition, the strain supports the integration of Macau in the Great Bay area, contributing to regional development and economic diversification. This strategic role underlines the importance of Macau in the broader economic and diplomatic initiatives in the country.
The promotion of higher education in RAE de Macao also played a crucial role in its development. In investing in education and research, Macau contributed to the objectives of national development and was positioned as a center of academic excellence. This bet on education has allowed to create a skilled labor, essential to sustain economic growth and innovation. The University of Macao is highly considered in global academic rankings. It was classified in 180th place at the World University Rankings 2025 by Times Higher Education, and 245th at QS World University Rankings 2025. In addition, the University of Macao is ranked 262nd in the best global universities by US News &amp; World Report. These classifications reflect the university's commitment to excellence in teaching and research, particularly in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Engineering and Social Sciences. The university's strong international collaboration and innovative investigation contribute significantly to their estimated global position.
This year is the third anniversary of the creation of the Guangdong-Macau in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin. In your opinion, how should Macau continue to take advantage of the advantages of the zone to develop himself and the education sector?
Hengqin's cooperation zone is one of the main objectives of Macao's modernization efforts. This zone has been fundamental to boosting innovation and economic diversification, providing a space for new industries and promoting a narrower integration with the continent. The area exemplifies Macau's commitment to modernization and its strategic role in regional development.
Macao is a unique mix of Chinese and Portuguese cultures. In your opinion, how can this merger help the nation to reinforce communication with the international community and tell the good stories of China?
Macao is a fascinating mix of cultures, where the East meets the West in a unique and harmonious way. His linguistic landscape is a testimony of his multicultural heritage. The Chinese is the official language and the Portuguese language can be used for official purposes, reflecting the historical ties of Macao with Portugal and its Chinese roots. English is also widely spoken, especially in business and tourism, which makes Macau a truly multilingual society.
The legal system of MSAR is another domain in which this cultural mixture is evident. Based on the Portuguese Civil Law System, it was adapted to the local context under the “one country, two systems” principle. This double legal system allows a unique mix of Chinese and Western legal traditions, ensuring that Macau's legal environment is familiar to its residents and accessible to international companies.
Macao's approach to the extrajudicial resolution of commercial conflicts further enhances its multicultural policy. The city offers various arbitration and mediation services that serve both local and international parts, promoting the efficient and friendly resolution of disputes. Macao's open city policy and multicultural attitude are the key to its success as a global center. The city welcomes people from around the world, promoting a diverse and inclusive community. This opening is reflected in its festivals, its gastronomy and their daily lives, where different cultures coexist and enrich each other. Essentially, the mix of language, legal systems and multicultural attitudes of Macau makes it a unique and dynamic place that establishes bridges between cultures and promotes global bonds.
What achievements would you like to see by Macau in the next 25 years?
In short, Macao's future is brilliant, with greater integration with mainland China, its central role in international trade, diversified economic growth and a strong global presence. These elements will ensure Macao's continuous success and development at the world scene. The 25th anniversary of Macao's return to the Fatherland celebrates not only a successful diplomatic achievement, but also the continuous contributions of the region to national and world development. Macao's strategic initiatives and their integration in national plans underline their importance as a dynamic region and facing the future.</description><pubDate>2024-12-16 02:20:12</pubDate></item><item><title>António Antunes, cartoonist: “Sometimes I consider myself an artist”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/12/antonio-antunes-cartoonista-as-vezes-considero-me-um-artista/</link><description>It's called Antonio Antunes, but signs her cartoons simply as Antonio. For 50 years it has characterized today using drawing and humor, most of them in the Express. In an interview, the cartoonist, who designed the days of the April 25, regrets that today young cartoonists do not have so many opportunities to sing in their career
This 50 -year adventure is already long dedicated to Cartoon. Have you ever thought you were going to do this for so many years?
No. Things were happening, and the result is this. There were not even perspectives to have a plan. Portugal has not been a country that greatly favors this type of activities.
He did training at António Arroio school during the Estado Novo period. What was it like to learn arts at a time when the country [Portugal] was so gray, with limits to creativity?
We mainly learned techniques, work or composition. Now creativity is something else. Not only was she very limited, but it's not something to sell either. There are no courses to take artists, there are courses that give us notions about painting composition or techniques, or colors. But that alone is not enough. Then there needs to be anything beyond what is academic. In the arts there is always anything that escapes even if you learn everything. Creativity is a strange thing because there is no rule.
Is Antonio considered an artist?
(Hesitates) Sometimes I consider.
He has had many controversial cartoons, namely Pope John Paul II with the condom in his nose. What were the cartoons that forced you to make the biggest waist play or deal with more pressures?
Maybe it's my happiness, but my problems are never a priori, but to posteriori. So far I have not been very limited in what I can do in the newspaper [Expresso]. Now, when things go out, sometimes have consequences. In Portugal it was the issue of condom in the Pope, internationally other things. This cartoon continues to move.
What was it like to deal with all this controversy?
This cartoon [Pope John Paul II] was controversial because they wanted to be so. That went very well and did not generate any ranks. Then there was a conservative movement within the church that wanted to make it a controversy, three weeks began to excite that, to make a petition. The man who led the Catholic forces said he expected a million signatures, but fortunately he got only 29,000, and the difference made the mountain not a mouse Parisse. It was even discussed at the Assembly [of the Republic]. It is a controversy a lot of little, even more, 30 years later, when the church itself is changing its point of view on this matter, namely with this Pope [Francis], fortunately. In the face of what led me to do this cartoon, I did it again. The Pope's statements at the time were public, they were not even hidden, inside walls, and spoke to the whole world, so also to me. I felt injured, that it made no sense. I think the Pope's attitude at that moment was criminal at the Pico da Aida and in Africa. It was of huge insensitivity and foolishness.
Is Cartoon a throwing weapon, a form of expression?
Throw of throwing is a hard expression of too much, but the cartoon is, in fact, the way I express myself. There are my colleagues who make articles, but I make drawings.
What other cartoons highlights, for what they brought you?
The first one that sensitized me was the one who made me win the world's largest salon in the world [major prize of the XX Salon International of Cartoon, Montreal, 1983], from this corner that is Portugal. A hall that had over a thousand participants, and gaining it was very good. I was safer, confident, because from then on they could continue to do things. This first cartoon also gave controversy, the “Warsaw Ghetto in Shatila”, in which I use the known photograph of the ghetto, a Jewish kid raised, harassed by Nazi soldiers, and in the cartoon the kid is Palestinian and Israeli soldiers. [The controversy was] with all the voices of the Jews, who are experts in this, making a lot of noise, with a certain tone of victimization, even if they are attacking. A hall director said he tried to change the vote, such is the weight of Jewish lobby, but failed.
This cartoon could be drawn today again.
I already published it again. Unfortunately it is not out of date.
But do you feel that much of what you designed about today is repeated, in a sign that the story is cyclical?
There is a resistance to change. One of the merits of the cartoonist is to be able to see ahead of time, or over time if you want. I have the invasion of Crimea made in 2014, and I assume that vision. It was above, and others did it later. There are other examples.
It begins to do cartoon after April 25, 1974, there a little there in the aftermath of the revolution. Do you feel that, in a way, has inaugurated the discipline of the Political Cartoon in Portugal?
Perhaps. But I'm not very clear about it, because before me there was a great designer, João Abel Manta, a fantastic chart, which had a huge difference from us, because we were kids and he already had a culture that allowed him that. But there is a less good side, because he did political propaganda. He was a man of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), and made this advertisement to where the revolution allowed it. Then when things stabilized, he went out and went to do other things. This does not remove the quality, but it is not my notion of Cartoon. I respond to the various stimuli of events otherwise. Cartoon allows me to express opinions, but be able to do so in different meanings of life, perspectives, without being a prisoner, as he became a prisoner of the PCP, was something that helped me a lot.
Did you ever feel any pressure from the newspapers where you collaborated?
(Hesitates). Some things, but they are not important. One thing I got, without much effort, was to make people think I have a bad shape, and it was better not to get me. It helped because they thought twice before talking to me. Once in Expresso, a type of sport commissioned me a cover, and began to give tips on how I should make the design. Until I asked you if I ever told you how to write news. This must have been in memory for many years, and must have reverberated this conversation in other people. I did not go to the Express, I was always in my corner and did not wear out with everyday life, with friendships and enmities.
Do you usually draw here, in the studio?
Here. But this [the image of bad shape] really helped me. And there is also the story of me having another profession. I often say that I really had two professions, because I was a cartoonist and graphic designer, and then I had my customers who were also of the Express, namely the tobacha. He was a friend of the commercial director, a comfortable type, who was staring to negotiate contracts with the newspaper in the name of A Tabaqueira. Therefore, I conveyed an effective image of power that actually did not have. If you add a type that has bad shape to a type that apparently has power, it is a boring (laughs).
When I ask you about the pressures, I think in the period right after April 25, 1974-1975, when everything was politicized. Were there bigger?
I managed to deal with it. During this period of the Prec (ongoing revolutionary process) it even had a cartoon over the need that lasted two years. It was a kind of escape forward. There was a great confusion, and I think it was interested in my newspaper [express], although that was never said. It gave an idea of ​​freshness of the newspaper about a complex period, but they never told me that. I have the idea of ​​this use of Cartoon, it was the way of consolidating the newspaper's independence regarding events, even when sometimes there was no such independence.
Are we today in a politically correct era, where everything seems to offend?
I don't feel, because I don't want to feel. I came to a phase of my life where if they didn't want to put up with me, they don't work. It's easy. Everything that was a struggle to impose a name and a point of view, a career, has already been made. It can be improved and consolidated, but if not, it is not. If I become very inconvenient for the newspaper where I work, and I want to believe this does not happen…
But in general terms, to the news, comments on social networks, do you feel that there is the politically correct?
Of course there is. My situation is of exception. The younger ones in the world of Cartoon have no opportunities at all. They have less than when I started. For various chances of life I have a position that has solidified, but this is not exemplary to what goes on. The new cartonists are full of trouble, there is no room for them, there is no means of payment. They are pushed to get out of the newspapers, not to enter.
Doesn't Cartoon have no place on social networks?
(Hesitates) It may appear, but it doesn't seem to me… Journalism is said to die and we cartoonists are going first. I think this is the trend. Journalism has been losing power in the face of social networks, with an anonymous opinion, which cannot be scrutinated, is very bad and mediocre. And that will grow.
What about Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Can replace the cartoonist.
This one I don't even speak because I do not know the limits, but I am intended to be terrible. It can indeed replace the cartoonist, but there is a subverting creativity.
Is there any public figure who particularly likes to portray in Cartoon?
The other day he said that, in relation to Trump, he had two antagonistic feelings: as a citizen, I find man detestable; But as a cartoonist is my raw material. Putin is also good. All men with many narratives and much power are likely to give good things from the point of view of analyzing a cartoonist. They are politicians with a very clear speech about what they want and what they want, and this can be good for Cartoon.
How do you feel to go to Macau again?
The exhibition [at the Military Club] will be different from the others, with 160 works. It's still a lot. It is a trip for these years, for Portuguese and international politics as well. I'm full of curiosity, promoting the show, seeing what they ask me, but this is part of the game.
The press of Macao does not have a great presence of Cartoon, except for Rodrigo [Rodrigo de Matos].
I know him, I get along with him. But I must say that the phenomenon is similar to Portugal. What do we have here? I, in the Express; Cristina Sampaio in the public; André Carrilho left the Diário de Notícias; António Maia in Correio da Manhã and little more. This is a general trend. Sometimes, and I think this happened to me, there are times when a cartoonist can represent a more value for the newspaper, but it's just a few moments when it can happen. In my most complicated period in Expresso, in the late 1970s, a reference newspaper that was in a country in convulsion, with some “irresponsibility” I could go ahead, and I have the perception that I helped the newspaper to detangle of these limitations. But this happens in very specific periods. In this phase [after April 25], I even made drawings at night that were already out of date.
Do you really have a bad shape or is it just to disguise?
I am shy, but I've been treating myself. (laughs) It was never something that had blocked me, I speak well in public. I'm a type I don't like to take stupid risks. I have been in this building for several years and I know only the gate because it has to be, and I do not want to have the risk of having an antipatic person to whom I confident. I do this with the greatest naturalness.
Military Club Exhibition
After the lecture at the Rui Cunha Foundation, this Wednesday, António will be today at the University of São José to talk to students at the “Cartoon Drawing: Ideas” workshop. This Friday follows the inauguration of the exhibition at the Military Club, which will be evident until January 2.</description><pubDate>2024-12-12 00:58:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Ben Lee, a game analyst, about the new concessions: “We need something grand”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/03/ben-lee-analista-de-jogo-sobre-as-novas-concessoes-precisamos-de-algo-grandioso/</link><description>The game analyst and consultant Ben Lee believes that it is necessary to do much more to diversify the economy of Macau beyond the game, especially given the type of events organized under the new concessions. The analyst thinks that Macau could look at two resorts in Vietnam as examples to follow international tourists
 
What balance do you do the two years of new game concessions?
There is still a lot of work to do. From what we could see so far, dealers have focused on lighter projects, such as local art galleries, cultural events, concerts and small rehabilitation of cultural neighborhoods. Large projects, such as the high -tech amusement park, the conservatory or new hotels have not yet been seen. Since two of the ten years have passed [concession], and given that the construction of some of these projects should take several years, it seems that it will be necessary to add them. The non-game segment revenues, in a percentage of gross revenue obtained by the dealers, seem to be higher than 2019, but have diminished in the last two years. It is possible to return to the next two years to be between the 10.5 and 11 percent verified in 2019.
Recently, Ho Iat Seng thanked the concessionaires for compliance with contracts and collaboration in the development of the non-game segment, reiterating that they were able to make some profits during the pandemic. Do you think it was fair in your words?
Casinos are making efforts to develop the non-game segment, but once again most of these efforts are focused on lower, lower-level events. We don't see great ideas like the $ 2.3 billion investment sphere we see in Las Vegas, for example. If that happened, it would easily fit the $ 15 billion commitments promised by the concessionaires [when signing the new contracts]. We could also talk about the idea of ​​making a Formula 1 competition on the street, as seen in Singapore and recently in Las Vegas.
How do you analyze the recovery of operators in terms of game revenue in recent months?
The recovery of the game in Macao has been extremely good, and the sector is expected to recover to about 78 or 79 percent of the levels recorded in 2019.
The Macao Game Society (SJM), for example, was one of the game operators with the greatest difficulty in terms of cash flow during the pandemic. Do you consider that your recovery, compared to the other five, was positive?
The SJM had difficulties at first, but it seems to be finally making some progress. But there will still be some challenges to reposition your hardware [facilities and other enterprises] in the future.
What can we expect from the new government of Sam Hou Fai for the game area?
The chief executive elected seems to be trying to ensure that operators honor their commitments. Your two terms will probably cover the next eight years of the new concessions. I think that, ultimately, everything will be known to know if he can motivate the various government appliances to perform his vision and mission.
In the context of new contracts, how do you see the global evolution of the game sector?
In 2019, the percentage of non-game segment revenues compared to the game's recipes reached 10.5 percent. This percentage rose to 22 percent during COVID-19, and has since gradually fallen to 13.5 percent, according to the third quarter of this year. This percentage will continue to decrease as game recipes continue to grow. In recent times we have seen residents of Macau and Hong Kong go to the north [China] to save money. The question that arises is why the inhabitants of the continent would go down and do the reverse? The solution, as provided by the authorities, is that Macau needs to diversify the market [of tourists and players] that comes from the continent. This makes perfect sense in terms of logic, but the reality is that our efforts seem to be regressing. Visitors from outside the Greater China represented 7.8 percent of the total visitors from Macao, but decreased to 6.5 percent by the end of September this year. This refers to the lightweight events that have been organized that, by far and largely, are really oriented to the Chinese who, after all, constitute most of our source of recipes.
How can you get around this scenario?
Returning to the beginning, I think we really need something large, iconic, similar to the sphere in Las Vegas or even something like the “Golden Bridge” project in Da Nang, worthy of appearing on Instagram, or “Bridge From the kiss ”, in Phu Quoc, both in Vietname. The fact that these projects were built by a local group linked to the hotel sector, without any connection to profits from the game, demonstrates long -term creativity and perspective in terms of planning.
Class struggle
Ben Lee warns of the mass market danger of “running away” from Macau
The conversation with Ben Lee comes in the context of a lecture that recently starred in the two years of new game concessions. Promoted by the France-Macau Chamber of Commerce, the session was named “Macau New Gaming Landscape: Two Years Into Concessions, What Now?”, Having Igamix Management &amp; Consulting, according to Asian Gaming Brief, according to the portal Gaming Brief (AgBrief), that the VIP game did not end completely, thus being the target of a new classification.
According to Agbrief, citing words by Ben Lee, "the mass game incorporated the same [players] level that was so openly criticized by the government," but that operators "are changing their focus to accommodating it."
The analyst highlighted the "recent focus on the transformation of older and older hotel rooms into luxury options, with all operators understanding the need to get quality rather than quantity."
However, he argued that “the focus on the luxury segment continues to create an impasse” because “Macau has long focused on increasing the number of visitors to increase revenues”, but the business model “goes against the need to increase expenses per person ”.
Ben Lee also warned that many tourists could, in fact, start choosing other more affordable destinations. The analyst argued that mass players "cannot be ignored" as they remain "the main engine" of the sector. "Exorbitant prices from hotel rooms can constitute a" dam "for the increase of visitors," as, as suggested, "gamblers can go to other vacation places, such as Thailand, if the price is not good." This Asian country “is growing and is expected to exceed Singapore in terms of gross revenues” at a time when Thai work in the new legislation on the game.
“They hope to pass your game law in May next year. Starting from the principle this happens three to five years to build an integrated resort or enterprise. They may be working considerably before the opening of Japan, ”said Ben Lee.
Still in relation to the game market in Asia, the analyst pointed out that Asian gamblers will focus on the future game markets of Thailand and Japan "while enjoying the current offers in Macau, Singapore and Philippines," wrote Agbrief.</description><pubDate>2024-12-03 00:08:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion expropriated from any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death , systematically carried out to this day (still in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the county).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hate speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Rui Valente is not due</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/automobilismo-rui-valente-nao-se-da-por-vencido/</link><description>Rui Valente will return this year for another season in motorsport in the region. The Macao driver has been in the active for the same time and will play the Macau Roadsport Challenge, the tourist car competition organized by the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), as well as the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix , in November
 
With the same enthusiasm recognized for decades, Rui Valente will again drive, in the 2025 season, a Subaru BRZ, the same car with which he competed in the Guide Circuit last November in the Macao Roadsport Challenge race. In the event held at the event of the territory, the Portuguese pilot finished sixth place, after losing some positions in the start, where he descended to tenth. The result was not even better because the rain -played race ended prematurely due to an opponent's accident.
In the competition for local pilots, which currently combines starting grids with more than half a hundred cars, all of them Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8), Rui Valente admitted to HM that “not being overcome”, also revealing who is “missing the podium, both in China and Macau…”.
Premium Racing Team driver had, in the last Macao Grand Prix, one of the fastest in terms of tip speed in the platoon of his race. Therefore, the bet for this year will be in other technical aspects of the car that go beyond the engine.
"At this time, I just wanted to increase the diameter of the front wheels and widen the gauge to improve the car's behavior," he confided to HM, also reporting that he intends to "optimize weight transmission during the curve and its. exit". These improvements, along with lock system updates, should increase the competitiveness of the Japanese machine in a fierce grid, consisting of Macau, Hong Kong pilots and China interior, with constantly evolving cars.
Undefined calendar
The AAMC -organized car competition calendar has not yet been revealed. In 2024, Macao Roadsport Challenge debuted at the Zhuzhou International Circuit in East of Hunan Province, but Rui Valente would rather the competition returned to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC) in Zhaoqing.
“I was very fond of returning to Gic, because I have everything there,” says the Portuguese pilot, defender of the track located in the neighboring province. “When you go to a qualification test, for those who make four races and then Macau, if you are on a track you already know, such as GIC, where you are seven or more years, each time you get on the track and try to do better than which last means you are improving and improving your driving. So you know you soon that you are stronger that year to Macau. ”
On the other hand, for the experienced pilot of the territory, “if you go to a new track, like the Zhuzhou circuit, besides floors there to learn the new layout and improve your time, you will never know if you are really stronger For Macao, as you know when you run in the gic. ”
Like what happened in past seasons, the Macao Roadsport Challenge calendar is expected to be composed of two weekends, with two races each, which also serve as an determination for the Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:47:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Tennis | Nuno Borges will play in front of Alcaraz in the Australia Open</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/16/tenis-nuno-borges-vai-jogar-frente-a-alcaraz-no-open-da-australia/</link><description>Nuno Borges surpassed the nervousness to defeat Australian Jordan Thompson in three sets in the second round of Australia Open, and will now face 'Carlitos' Alcaraz without pressure, admitted the Portuguese tennis player to Lusa agency.

The 27-year-old Maiato contradicted Wednesday the favoritism of the 'local' Jordan Thompson, 27th standard head, imposed on 6-3, 6-2 and 6-4 partials, in one hour and 47 minutes, in a John Cain Arena - the third most important court by Melbourne Park - crowded.
"It was very nervous, it was a big stadium, not every day [that happens], so I think inside that I could make a very good game and I really am very happy for the result," he said.
Follow to Alcaraz
Semifinalist in Auckland at the start of the year, Borges has now extended his good moment, setting a meeting in the third round with Spanish Carlos Alcaraz, the third world player.
“Now, against 'Carlitos', there is not much to say.

Peter Hickman goes to the fifth season in the British Championship with Fho Racing, however, before the season's start, some rumors came to circulate in Paddock about the team's future. In recent years, FHO Racing has become one of the top teams in the British Superbike Championship and road events, such as the MAN's island TT or the Macao Grand Prix.
Last November, the team announced that they featured Peter Hickman and Davey Todd, winner of the troubled last edition of the Macao Grand Motor Prize in the British Superbike Championship. Faye Ho said at the time that “for 2025 and also for this year's Macao Grand Prix, we have a very strong team, with Davey joining Pete and Michael aboard the BMW. We have two super talented drivers on the roads for next season, and with Davey jumping to the Superbike class, after winning the Superstock Championship for the second time, I think we'll have a strong season. I can't expect my team to return to Macau, I love to share my hometown with the team and show all points of interest, it's such a special place for me. ”
Although Hickman and Todd have been present at the BMW Motorrad Motorsport season in Berlin in mid -January, since November that Fho Racing has no news, which has generated some discomfort and doubts among fans. Hickman was testing his BMW M1000RR of his phr Performance in Spain, when he responded with a blunt "no" to a fan of a fan on Instagram social network about the rumor of the ceiling of activity of FHO Racing, a "no" that " It had wide repercussions in the specialized British press.
It's not the first time
After a difficult season of his team in 2024 in the British Superbike Championship, Faye Ho, Stanley Ho's granddaughter, had to face similar rumors last September. In Oulton Park, before the opening race of the 2024 showdown, Faye Ho confirmed to journalists that FHO Racing would continue to participate in the British Superbike Championship of 2025, “which is good news, but anything will be announced to your time. But I'm happy to be back here and to stay here, it's a big championship and I love to be in this racing environment. ”
To increase speculation between fans, Hickman suggested on social networks a change of direction this year, leaving an announcement about his plans for the North West 200 and TT of the island of Man. In Spain, the British will have tested with the Your motorcycle without any reference and FHO Racing stickers, while Todd changed his profile photo on social networks, for a photo with a motorcycle from Milwaukee BMW by Tas Racing.
Sources of the world of motorcycling tell us that the future of the Racing should be known in the coming days, but one right thing is that Hickman, regardless of the team, has in his sports program to travel to MSAR in November, to try win the fifth victory in the guide circuit.</description><pubDate>2025-02-07 02:20:15</pubDate></item><item><title>GT Cup | Great Bay Race gains impulse from the interior</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/taca-gt-corrida-da-grande-baia-ganha-impulso-do-interior/</link><description>The GT Cup-Great Bay Race will join this year, the newly created Sro GT Cup, the latest GT competition launched in the interior of China, inspired by the GT4 class vehicles of the Macau Grand Prix
 
On the eve of last Christmas, Sro Motorsport Group, the entity responsible for organizing numerous races and championships, including the GT World Challenge Asia and, as the official partner of the FIA, the co-coordination of the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau , announced the creation of a competition for GT4 vehicles, consisting of four events in China. At the time of the announcement, only the inaugural event in Shanghai and the end in Beijing had been confirmed as part of the calendar.
Almost 30 cars, representing an impressive total of ten automotive builders, participated in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race of 2024, a race that has become an important milestone over the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix in recent years. Indeed, no other GT4 event in Asia brings together such quantity and diversity of cars. The Balance of Performance (BOP), responsible for balancing the performance of the various participating cars, was, at the time, managed by SRO.
In a statement, Benjamin Frannasovici, managing director of Sro Motorsports Asia, said:
“We are enchanted, proud and privileged for adding the GT Cup - Great Bay Race to the inaugural calendar of Sro GT Cup, which begins and ends with the two largest motorized sports events in China. We already have a strong working relationship with the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, which has become the most significant race for GT4 cars in Asia. Its inclusion in the 2025 calendar of the SRO underlines the size of our ambition for this new national series. ”
High interest
The SRO GT Cup debut season starts in March at China's Formula 1 Grand Prix in Shanghai, before moving to the Zhuhai International Circuit - a place previously visited by SRO in BPR times and the FIA ​​GT Championship - where two 30 minutes races are planned. This is followed by the new Citadine Circuit of Beijing, which will host the GT World Challenge Asia on the same weekend, before the big end of the Sro GT Cup season, scheduled for a month later at the Guide Circuit in Macao.
The enthusiasm surrounding this competition is evident. As Benjamin Franassovici said, “This is reflected in the number of consultations and registration for the full season we have received since the release of the championship, just before Christmas. The demand has exceeded our expectations. ”
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the season end event on the streets of Macau, with places to be assigned based on the classification after the second round of the championship, which is scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit. All pilots with “bronze” or “silver” classifications attributed by the FIA ​​are eligible to compete in this competition, as long as they use approved cars from the GT4 class.
To attract brands, the results of SRO GT Cup races will tell the SRO GT4 builders ranking, a title attributed to the brand with better performance in the GT4 category at the end of each season. SRO GT CUP joins its Asian equivalent, Japan Cup, in a list that also includes continental and national competitions in Europe, America and Australia.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 11:13:41</pubDate></item><item><title>After “very positive meeting”, Borges “looking forward to playing at a stadium” with Thompson</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/14/apos-encontro-muito-positivo-borges-ansioso-por-jogar-num-estadio-com-thompson/</link><description>Portuguese tennis player Nuno Borges premiered yesterday, the 13th, at the 113rd edition of the Australia Open, first major of the time, with a “very positive meeting” against Frenchman Alexandre Muller in Melbourne Park, where he will now face Australian Jordan Thompson.

I felt that I kept quite constant except in the tie-break of the first set, which I didn't play very well. I always kept looking for and very consistent during a meeting and this turned out to be the key to the result, ”he said in statements to Lusa.
The world's national and 33rd number one needed two hours and 55 minutes to get the best of the Gaul opponent, recently champion of the Hong Kong ATP 250, in four sets, by the 6-7 (2-7) partials (2-7) , 6-3, 6-2 and 7-5, but believes it has deserved the triumph, in the return to Melbourne, where a year ago became in the first Portuguese tennis player to reach the round of 16.
“I feel like I deserved to win in four sets, I was slightly higher from the first set and I'm very happy. The first rounds are never easy in terms of sensations. Tennis does not flow the same way, is trying to gain pace, but fortunately meetings at the best of five sets give more time to find this rhythm. I feel that I ended up the meeting quite well, although exhausting too, ”he explained.
After the inaugural round victory, Nuno Borges will “take the opportunity to rest and recover tomorrow to play possibly Wednesday” with a home player, Jordan Thompson (27th ATP), who today surpassed at Margaret Court Arena O 'Qualifier' German Dominik Koepfer also in four partials, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, 4-6 and 6-3.

This year, the young German Luca Engstler, who first participated in a GT3 car, felt the old maxim of this circuit in the skin: “The mistakes pay dearly”
 
After eight weeks after the most severe accident of his career, the 24 -year -old is still recovering from the apparent misfortune at the Cup of GT World Cup of the 71st Macao Grand Prix. On Friday afternoon, with the chronometer counting and when trying to improve his brand, Luca Engstler lost control of his Lamborghini Huracán GT3 Evo in the dreaded Mandarin curve, beating over 230 km/h in protective barriers. The car inscribed by the Liqui Moly Team Engstler, but prepared and placed by Grasser Racing Team, was completely destroyed and the German pilot even became unconscious after the impact.
“This is a unique event, Lamborghini's progress was not very good and to be ahead we had to risk more than the others.

Two months after what was “the most horrible day of my life to this day,” former German Touring Champion (TCR) is still in the recovery process.
“It was really a big impact,” said Luca Engstler, in conversation with the specialized portal motorsport-total.com, who needed a wheelchair after the accident. “The big problem was that my right ankle suffered a lot. I tore the lateral ligaments and had a lot of hemorrhages in tibia and fibula, which caused some concern, ”he recalled.
Returning to walk normally was also a big challenge for the young Lamborghini pilot, who in the 2024 season impressively won two DTM races and first participated in a GT3 car in Macao. "It took me a long time to be able to walk," he recalled. “In the first two or three days, I was really a wheelchair, because I just couldn't do anything and all the bones hurt me,” Engstler described to the publication of his country, saying that “he had bruises everywhere and everything was difficult ”.
Recover
Still, Lucas Engstler, at the end of the day of the accident, already at the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center, made a publication on social networks to say that everything was fine. The pilot, who was in Macao accompanied by his father, Franz Engstler - also a pilot and a well -known figure of Asian motorsport - wanted to reassure the closest. Two days after the accident, appeared on the GT da Fia World Cup starting grid on Sunday, without crutches, only slightly supported by an umbrella.
"What was important to me was not wanting to make a big sink about this," he explained to the Germanic portal. "In the end, the accident seemed very serious, but that only shows how safe the cars are," he said.
The pilot continues to recover from the sequelae of the strong impact. He took advantage of the winter break to take a trip from Autocaravana to Sweden with his best friend. "Everything is going well," he said, clarifying that he can run. "I would say I'm 95 percent and I have no permanent damage."
After the accident, the German worked on their recovery in the Allgäu region, in their homeland, “with some acquaintances, who are physiotherapists and doctors. I received excellent assistance. ”
Return
Luca Engstler admits that she has become impatient during the recovery process. "I was told that I could only do sports again in early February, but of course this could not accept," recognizing that he started training earlier than recommended.
Fortunately to Luca Engstler, DTM only starts on the last weekend of April. In the coming times, the pilot plans to sit back behind the wheel, possibly in a rental kart to start. The aim is to be in shape for the beginning of the preseason and the preparation tests of the popular German championship, scheduled for mid-February and early March.
As for the Macao Grand Prix, two days after the accident, Luca Engstler was quite clear: “I told everyone that my goal is to return and try to fight for victory in this great race.”</description><pubDate>2025-01-12 23:43:24</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
