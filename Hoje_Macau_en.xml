Since 1979, “foreign powers have always sought to reestablish the previous situation”, declared Ali Khamenei, in reference to external influence during the Pahlavi dynasty (1925-1979), an ally of the Americans, which was removed from power by the revolution.
Led by the then 'ayatollah' Ruhollah Khomeini, Shiite fundamentalists established the Islamic Republic following the 1979 revolution, which deposed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last shah of Iran, formally called Persia until 1935.
“The power of a nation lies not so much in its missiles and planes, but in the will and resilience of its people,” said Khamenei, quoted by the France-Presse news agency (AFP).
“Show it again and thwart the enemy’s plans,” said the supreme leader, calling on Iranians to participate in the anniversary of the revolution.
“The presence of the people at the march and the expression of loyalty to the Islamic Republic will make the enemy retreat from its ambition against Iran and national interests,” said Khamenei, also quoted by the Spanish agency EFE.
The country's highest political and religious authority has assured that the demonstration of “national power” through unity will lead to “the discouragement of the enemy”.
Khamenei warned that, as long as the enemy is not discouraged, “he will not stop causing inconvenience” to the Iranians. He also mentioned that on February 11, 1979, the Iranian people achieved a “great victory by freeing the country from foreign intervention”.
Khamenei did not participate on Sunday in the annual meeting with the commanders of the Air Force, the first military body to join the 1979 revolution.
Blood in the streets
The speech comes at one of the Islamic Republic's most fragile moments, after the violent repression of protests against the regime and in the face of the threat of US military intervention if a nuclear agreement is not reached.
The demonstrations, which began on December 28th due to the devaluation of the currency in Tehran, spread throughout the country and were crushed on January 8th and 9th. The Iranian government admitted the deaths of 3,117 people, attributing the violence to the United States and Israel.
The non-governmental organization HRANA, based in North American territory, counted 6,961 deaths, and is still verifying more than 11 thousand possible deaths and 51 thousand arrests.
The UN special rapporteur for Iran, Mai Sato, said that medical reports point to the possibility of up to 20,000 deaths, although the United Nations highlights the difficulty of corroborating the data. Following the crackdown, authorities launched a wave of arrests of moderate political figures and activists.
At the same time, Iran and the United States resumed negotiations for a nuclear agreement last week, in the first meeting after the 12-day war between Tehran and Tel Aviv. The United States participated in the conflict by bombing Iranian nuclear facilities.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:31:54</pubDate></item><item><title>UTM | Cultural consultancy and promotion company created</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/utm-criada-empresa-de-consultadoria-e-promocao-cultural/</link><description>The Macau Tourism University (UTM) has created a new company that will dedicate itself to consulting in areas such as tourism, culture, research, training courses and even commercial investment management.

According to the Chinese Radio Macau channel, the fraud scheme was similar to all the victims and began with a comment from the alleged fraudster in social media posts made by women who wanted to go to concerts and had difficulty acquiring tickets.
One of the victims lost a total of 10,438 patacas, having started by transferring 6,000 patacas as payment for two tickets that the fraudster had arranged. Afterwards, the suspect said that the tickets were already sold out, promising a refund that never happened. The scammer also sent QR codes for victims to contact a fake employee from a financial department who would help with reimbursement, leading victims to transfer more money.
In this woman's case, another three thousand patacas were transferred, with the suspect claiming that the operation had not been successful, demanding more payments. Só então a mulher percebeu que poderia estar a ser vítima de burla, queixando-se à polícia. The Judicial Police (PJ) says it received complaints regarding five cases of fraud between the 6th and 8th of February, all of which are being investigated. Ainda não houve detenções.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:09:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Book by Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni launched in Lisbon this week</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/livro-de-rui-leao-e-carlotta-bruni-lancado-em-lisboa-esta-semana/</link><description>This Friday, the 13th, in Lisbon, the launch of the book by local architects Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni, “Layering The City”, will take place at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. The session starts at 11:30 am and is part of the third International Congress on Colonial and Post-Colonial Landscapes, Architecture, Cities and Work, with a presentation by the authors themselves.
“Layering The City” is an investigation into infrastructures and public spaces in Macau, revealing the perspectives that Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni put into each project they undertake, with a focus on projects such as social housing in the Fai Chi Kei neighborhood, the Barra station and the Intermodal zone, related to the Light Rail.
As explained by Rui Leão in an interview with HM, the book is composed “of texts by some critics about our work”, namely Jorge Figueira, and an interview conducted by academic Ana Vaz Milheiro, also author of the preface.
In this book, there is the idea of ​​construction in layers, revealing the different perspectives of the two architects in each project they carry out. "There is work brought by each person to the project, which involves responding to the programmed request, what the client asks for, what lives in the alignment plan [of the project], or a series of issues at a civic level, public space or the right to quality of life. There are a series of social dimensions [to take into account to] make spaces for people, even when they are impossible [in terms] of politics and in the city. It is these layers that enter the projects and that, deep down, pass for creating opportunities to improve the life of the city, the person, the street”, said Rui Leão in the same interview.
Portuguese houses
Meanwhile, architect Rui Leão also participates, as co-curator, in the exhibition “Habitar Portugal 1974-2924″, opened this Wednesday, starting at 7pm, at the Architecture Center – Garagem Sul, at the Centro Cultural de Belém, in Lisbon.
This is an initiative that marks 50 years of Democracy through a selection of one hundred works of Portuguese Architecture, built in Portugal and around the world between 1974 and 2024”, with the team of curators Alexandra Saraiva and Célia Gomes.
According to the official description of the exhibition, available on the CCB website, what is sought is to look at architecture “as a political gesture; to highlight positions of rupture; to enhance the persistence of memories”. You can see projects such as the Hotel Dom Henrique, in Porto, designed by José Carlos Loureiro, or the Complexo das Amoreiras, by Tomás Taveira. Highlights include works such as the Côa Museum, by Camilo Rebelo and Tiago Pimentel, or the requalification project of Casa do Passal – Museu Aristides de Sousa Mendes, by the studio Rosmaninho + Azevedo.
This is the seventh edition of the “Habitar Portugal” exhibition, with one hundred works having been chosen “with different programs and different scales, guided by national and international representation (including the Portuguese expression built outside the country)”.
According to the same note, “this is a significant and valuable record that not only offers a panoramic look at the last quarter of the 20th century and the first of the 21st century, but also seeks to project the future of contemporary Portuguese architecture, and consequently the social, economic and territorial development of Portugal in the world”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:25:45</pubDate></item><item><title>HK | Beijing defends “severe punishment” for Jimmy Lai</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/hk-pequim-defende-castigo-severo-para-jimmy-lai/</link><description>The heavy sentence imposed on the former press tycoon received applause from Beijing for concluding that Jimmy Lai seriously endangered national security
The Chinese government yesterday defended that businessman and activist Jimmy Lai deserves a “severe punishment” for having “severely endangered” national security, following his sentence to 20 years in prison in Hong Kong.
At a press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian stated that Lai “was one of the main organizers and participants in a series of anti-China incidents that destabilized Hong Kong”, in a reference to the 2019 anti-government demonstrations.
According to Lin, the actions of the founder of the Apple Daily newspaper, which has since closed, “severely harmed the prosperity, stability and well-being of Hong Kong”. The central government “firmly supports” the authorities of the Special Administrative Region “in safeguarding national security, in accordance with the law, and in punishing crimes that put it at risk”, he added.
In response to international criticism of the sentence, Lin Jian urged “to respect China's sovereignty and the rule of law in Hong Kong”, asking that “irresponsible statements be avoided” and “stop interfering in Hong Kong's judicial affairs and China's internal affairs”.
Criticisms and appeals
The human rights organization Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) reacted to the decision, classifying the conviction as “political” and highlighting that Jimmy Lai, aged 78, was the target of a long judicial process, having been found guilty in December 2025.
The CHRD recalled that United Nations experts in 2024 considered Lai's detention as “arbitrary” and called for his release on humanitarian grounds after the December verdict.
The trial took place before three judges designated specifically for cases related to the National Security Law. The indictment attributed to the businessman a sustained campaign to promote international sanctions against China and Hong Kong, through Apple Daily and his network of contacts.
The defense argued that the published content was part of the public debate protected by the right to freedom of expression.
EU condemns sentence
The European Union (EU) yesterday condemned the 20-year prison sentence imposed on Jimmy Lai, a businessman linked to the media, by a Hong Kong court and demanded his immediate release. “The EU deplores the harsh 20-year prison sentence imposed on British citizen and media businessman Jimmy Lai by the Hong Kong High Court on 9 February 2026”, reads the statement published by the European Union External Action Service.
According to the diplomatic service of the European bloc, “the EU reiterates its call for the immediate and unconditional release of Jimmy Lai, also taking into account his advanced age and health”. “The political persecution of Jimmy Lai and former Apple Daily executives and journalists damages Hong Kong’s reputation,” the statement highlighted.
“Deserved” penalty
Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said yesterday that the founder of the Apple Daily newspaper, Jimmy Lai, “deserved” the 20-year prison sentence imposed on him. Lai was convicted of three counts of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces and publishing seditious material. Eight other defendants in the same case received sentences ranging from six years and three months to ten years in prison.
In a statement, John Lee stated that the 156 days of public hearings “with a large volume of evidence presented” proved that Jimmy Lai was “a despicable and unscrupulous anti-China leader”. “The defendant committed several heinous crimes and his malicious acts are beyond measure,” the official added.
For Lee, the heavy sentence “demonstrates that the rule of law is respected and that justice was served”, which “brings relief to everyone”. The Chief Executive admitted, however, that Hong Kong “has already paid a heavy price”, stating that many residents, especially young people, were “misled” by Apple Daily during the 2019 protests, becoming “radical”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:15:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Research | Businessman Ng Lap Seng in the Epstein files</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/investigacao-empresario-ng-lap-seng-nos-ficheiros-epstein/</link><description>Local businessman Ng Lap Seng, convicted in the Public Works case, appears in five Epstein files due to the trial in New York in which he was sentenced to three years in prison. References appear in newsletters analyzing investigation trends into “white collar” crimes and in email exchanges between FBI departments
Macau businessman Ng Lap Seng, who was released from Coloane prison last year after serving two and a half years in the Public Works case, also appears in the Epstein files, analyzed by HM. It is recalled that Ng Lap Seng was sentenced in 2018 in the United States to three years in prison for bribing the president of the United Nations General Assembly, John Ashe, to guarantee support for the construction of an international organization's conference center in Macau.
In an email sent by a firm of legal analysts, with the receiver crossed out, in which a compilation of news and analyzes of cases of financial corruption is made, there is news about the Ng Lap Seng case and how an accomplice of the businessman, in charge of delivering the bribe, escaped a prison sentence for having collaborated with justice.
The other reference to Ng Lap Seng appears in an email sent by the Department of Justice itself, about a week before Jeffrey Epstein's death, with a newsletter on investigation trends in international corruption cases.
The Macau businessman is mentioned in an article where he says he paid a security firm, made up in part of former FBI agents, to take care of his security in an apartment in New York (mid-town), while he awaited the start of the trial.
The other three documents in which Ng Lap Seng's name appears are email exchanges between FBI departments, dated between the end of May and the beginning of June 2019, about two months before Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in a cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. The subject of the emails indicated is the management of documents discovered in the investigation.
At the end of the emails, the cases handled by the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Southern District of New York, in collaboration with the FBI, are listed, including the case of Ng Lap Seng.
Life is a party
Another lurid detail where references to Macau appear in the “Epstein Library”, as the US Department of Justice calls it”, is in the case that Hanna Bouveng filed against the owner of the New York Global Group, tycoon Benjamin Wey, in a process that culminated in 2015 with compensation of 18 million dollars, which would later be reduced to 5.6 million dollars.
The Tianjin-born businessman was accused of defamation in one of the many legal cases he faced. Benjamin Wey's judicial “career” includes accusations of eight crimes of conspiracy, financial and electronic fraud and money laundering, on suspicion of using offshore accounts to hide transactions between Chinese companies and American shell companies. The case would eventually collapse due to illegally obtaining evidence.
The reasons why the Epstein files contain documents from the court case between Hanna Bouveng and Benjamin Wey are unclear, something that recurs in the documentary “library”, where a lack of context is the norm.
However, the case alleges that two defendants, including Wey, published an article in a magazine with the title: “Do you want to attract Swedish women?”. Hanna Bouveng, of Swedish nationality, is characterized in the article as “a girl who likes to party and who has just arrived at the clubs of New York after a year of providing ‘entertainment’ in clubs in Hong Kong and casinos in Macau”, alluding to prostitution activities.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:08:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Requests concrete measures to promote NAPE</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/economia-pedidas-medidas-concretas-para-promover-nape/</link><description>With small and medium-sized companies dealing with the reality of the closure of satellite casinos, the deputy linked to the Jiangme community, Lee Koi Ian, asks the Executive for a plan with concrete measures to promote the economy in NAPE
With NAPE facing the end of satellite casinos and their impact on the local economy, MP Lee Koi Ian is calling on the Government to come up with measures to deal with the new problems. The position was taken through a written interpellation, published on the Legislative Assembly portal.
“As the satellite casinos gradually ceased operations in NAPE, the surrounding commercial districts face a sharp decline in the number of visitors, plunging the entire area into a difficult situation, characterized by imbalance between sectors and the loss of customers”, begins by outlining the scenario, the deputy supported by the Jiangmen community.
Lee Koi Ian also recognizes that the Government Action Lines for this year promise to promote “a series of carnival-style events” at NAPE, with experiences that are expected to attract greater “cultural and tourist consumption” in order to “revitalize the image of the community and increase the vitality of the commercial area”.
However, the legislator is now asking the Executive for more concrete plans. "Given the value of the location and the commercial base of NAPE's surrounding districts, it is crucial to establish a long-term revitalization mechanism. This is the central approach to avoid dependence on short-term policies, break the impasse of homogenized competition and cultivate a sustainable commercial ecosystem," he said. “Does the Government have a specialized plan to revitalize the commercial areas around NAPE?”, he asks.
Profound changes
Lee Koi Ian also warns of the difficulties of not only attracting tourists to that area of ​​the city, but making them want to stay and consume there, taking into account the existence of other more attractive places.
“The transition of commercial zones from a transit destination to a consumption destination is not only central to sustainable development. It is also a crucial measure to create a local commercial ecosystem”, argues Lee Koi Ian. “In this context, what specific measures will the Government introduce in ZAPE commercial areas, to help small and medium-sized companies to modernize, while cultivating different business formats?”, he asks.
The deputy also calls for optimizing NAPE's infrastructure, expanding pedestrian facilities and organizing “various events to increase the circulation of people and stimulate the vitality of local consumption”. The request is made despite the measures being seen only as palliative care to facilitate the transition.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:07:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Food safety | Requests for improvements in supervision</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/seguranca-alimentar-pedidas-melhorias-na-supervisao/</link><description>The assemblyman linked to the Fujian community is concerned about the transport of food in the case of food platforms and also the most recent recalls of baby products
Following cases of baby products being withdrawn from the market and reports of food poisoning in local luxury restaurants, MP Chan Lai Kei wants the Government to strengthen food supervision. The request is contained in a written interpellation, released yesterday.
According to the deputy linked to the Fujian community, although the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) announced that last year the general approval rate for inspections carried out through food sampling was 99 percent, food safety faces more and new challenges.
In relation to baby products, taking into account the recent cases of food recalls, such as powdered milk, the deputy wants to know whether the authorities will be more demanding in providing information on the origin and route of the items.
“Neighboring regions have already established a ‘baby food tracking labeling system,’ requiring importers to provide full information about the production chain so that parents can check the food’s journey via a QR code,” Chan wrote. “Will the IAM move forward with the establishment of a ‘special supervision plan for children’s foods’, implementing more frequent tests for powdered milk and children’s complementary foods, as well as regularly publishing the safety levels of brands?”, he asked.
Dangers of take-away
Other challenges arise associated with the progressive increase in the number of visitors and a new culture of take-away not only for food, but also for drinks.
According to Chan, the number of orders on take-away platforms continues to rise every year. However, during transport and waiting times, the deputy indicates that there is no temperature control or hygiene regulations, due to “regulatory gaps”. This is an aspect that the deputy hopes to see changed: “How will the authorities reinforce interdepartmental cooperation, and formulate mandatory standards for the hygiene of take-away boxes, time limits for delivery and separation of packaging when transporting hot and cold food […]?” question.
Chan Lai Kei also suggests using digital methods to remotely control food, with random inspections.
In the document, the legislator also points out that Macau welcomes more than 40 million visitors annually, and that banquets and festivals are frequent, which increases food risks. For this reason, Chan Lai Kei suggests that the Government draw up a food safety response plan during the peak tourism season so that it can quickly trace the origin of any poisoning.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:02:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Presidential | Seguro wins elections in Macau and nationally</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/presidenciais-seguro-ganha-eleicoes-em-macau-e-a-nivel-nacional/</link><description>The former leader of the Socialist Party will be the future President of the Republic of Portugal, succeeding Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. When 20 parishes still needed to be counted, where the elections were postponed due to bad weather, Seguro collected 66.82 percent of the votes
António José Seguro was the winner of the elections and will be the future President of the Republic of Portugal, after having achieved 66.82 percent of the votes (3.4 million votes), against André Ventura's 33.18 percent (1.7 million votes). The candidate linked to the Socialist Party also won in Macau, where he obtained 68.53 percent of the votes, against 31.47 percent for the candidate supported by Chega.
In relation to the territory, a total of 1,403 voters were counted, with Seguro collecting 934 votes and Ventura 429 votes. There were also 32 blank votes (2.28 percent) and eight invalid votes (0.57 percent).
The results show that there were 971 fewer people voting in the second round in Macau than in the first, when 2,374 votes had been recorded. The abstention rate for the second round among the 57,748 voters reached 97.45 percent, with those voting at 2.43 percent.
In the first round, Luís Marques Mendes, a candidate supported by the Social Democratic Party, received the most votes and received 1,073 votes, a figure above that which now contributed to guaranteeing the presidency to António José Seguro. In the first vote, the participation rate was 4.11 percent, which represented an abstention of 95.98 percent. In this round of voting, António José Seguro came in second place, with 477 votes and André Ventura in third, with 282 votes.
China was safe
Yesterday's results were provisional, as there were still 20 parishes to be counted in Portugal and seven “consulates” abroad.
Among the so-called “consulates” by the National Elections Commission, the results from Beijing remained to be determined. However, the votes from Macau combined with those from Shanghai gave Seguro victory, with 944 votes, against Ventura's 432. In Shanghai, Seguro obtained 10 votes, against three for Ventura, with no blank or invalid votes being recorded.
Despite the results in China, Ventura managed to be the most voted abroad with 51.88 percent of the votes (42,265) against 48.12 percent for Seguro (39,208), while blank votes were 1.21 percent and invalid votes were 0.65 percent.
“Working for Portugal”
In his victory speech, António José Seguro promised to work to develop the country and presented himself as the “president of all Portuguese”, even those who did not vote for him. “As the future President of the Republic, I add that from tonight onwards we are no longer adversaries and we now have a shared duty to work for a more developed and fairer Portugal”, stated the winner of the night, in a speech given in Caldas da Rainha. “The majority that elected me disappears tonight [Sunday]”, he added.

The conclusion is a study on Timorese foreign policy within the scope of the Chinese initiative, authored by three Portuguese academics
Timor-Leste, a young country, has been cementing its relations with China, namely through the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, but there is still some caution surrounding this relationship. This is one of the conclusions of the study “Timor-Leste's foreign policy options within the scope of China's Belt and Road 2.0 Initiative: a small state perspective”, authored by academics Tiago Botelho dos Santos, Diogo Borges and Paulo Afonso Duarte. The work was published in The Pacific Review, an academic journal edited by Taylor &amp; Francis.
The research work starts with Timor-Leste's adherence to the Chinese initiative, something that happened in 2017, to analyze how the relationship with China has been going, taking into account the fact that Timor-Leste has “the status of a small state”.
It is concluded, therefore, that “Timor-Leste's involvement with China's Belt and Road Initiative, particularly in the post-2023 period, can be understood as a strategic and calculated attempt to maximize its status as a small state in a complex regional and global environment”. It is described that, in this period, Timorese foreign policy has been characterized “by a multi-vector approach, strategically anchored in multilateralism”, seeking to “diversify international partnerships to reinforce national security, promote economic development and expand its voice in the international system”.
The study points out that relations between Timor-Leste and China, in the context of the Belt and Road initiative, are a “deliberate movement to leverage development opportunities” in the country, being a strategy aligned with the Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030.
The plan aims to “promote economic diversification and the development of critical infrastructure, in a context in which the Belt and Road 2.0 Initiative emphasizes digital infrastructure, green energy and cooperation in the area of ​​health”.
Timorese potential
The three academics also highlight that Timor-Leste, as part of the Chinese geopolitical initiative, has the potential to stand out economically, and also in commercial terms, in the region. The country has “the potential to assert itself as a logistical center on a route that connects the South Indian Ocean to the South Pacific”, so the Chinese initiative “offers a relevant opportunity to significantly increase its regional prominence and decisively facilitate” integration into ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations], to which Timor-Leste recently joined.
Despite all these positive signs, the study concludes that “although Timor-Leste's relationship with China has deepened, culminating in a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2024, its engagement continues to be marked by cautious pragmatism”.
In this context, “the benefits of greater connectivity and investment are carefully weighed against concerns regarding debt sustainability, transparency and possible strategic dependencies”. This caution on the part of Timor-Leste demonstrates its “capacity for action by selectively engaging in projects aligned with its national interests”, navigating the “complexities of competition between great powers in the Indo-Pacific, while maintaining its commitment to a balanced and diversified foreign policy”.
Timorese pragmatism is also evident, according to the study, in the fact that the country “not only optimizes development opportunities, but also reinforces its regional position by meticulously analyzing economic benefits in the face of potential risks”. What is strengthened, “ultimately”, is the “capacity for action as a small State”, highlight the authors.
A “remarkable” ability
The study in question highlights how Timor-Leste has had “a remarkable capacity for action” in the context of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, using other small States, such as Sri Lanka, as a point of comparison.
Citing other studies, the three academics highlight how “Timor-Leste has demonstrated a more cautious approach than countries like Sri Lanka, which have faced significant concerns about debt sustainability associated with BRI [Belt and Road Initiative] projects, or landlocked states like Laos and coastal nations like Cambodia.”
In the case of these Southeast Asian countries, “Chinese loans for emblematic projects, such as railways and highways, have drastically increased external debt and dependence on Beijing”.
What we sought to do in this investigation was “to examine the unique position of Timor-Leste, not as a financier, but also not as a victim of a ‘debt trap'”, highlighting “the distinct and valuable form of action capacity of a small State within the scope of the BRI”.
The authors highlight that, in the last decade, China “significantly expanded its presence in Southeast Asia” through the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, thereby “expanding its regional influence in the economic, security and political spheres”. In this relationship, Timor-Leste has been “far from being a passive observer”, seeking to “actively engage with China to ensure development benefits”.
Timor-Leste sought to “identify an opportunity to align with the long-term objectives” of its Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030, analysts indicate.
“Strategically, the country also intends to capitalize on its geographic position in emerging commercial maritime routes, particularly through the establishment of a logistics hub in the South Indian Ocean and the South Pacific, potentially reinforcing its regional role as a new integrated member state of ASEAN”, point out the authors.
Timor-Leste seeks to “balance economic gains and potential dependencies”, in a geopolitical context that “includes competition between great powers in the Indo-Pacific, where United States policies, under successive administrations, aim to contain China's regional influence”.
In methodological terms, the authors carried out this investigation based on reading official reports, documents that serve as the basis for signed bilateral agreements and government documentation. In addition, interviews were carried out with “experts based in both Europe and Asia”.
The authors state that they sought to interview academics and diplomats “due to the fact that ordinary citizens are generally unfamiliar with China's global multilateral initiatives, while diplomats tend to be excessively cautious in their statements, as they represent the official position of their state, and not necessarily their personal opinions”.
It is therefore understood that academics “tend to offer more balanced and rigorous analyses”. The questions focused on how Timor-Leste, as a small State, has benefited from the Chinese initiative, whether this initiative is compatible with the Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030, or whether “there are visible dangers of creating dependency” between the two countries, among other issues.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 01:54:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran | Leader calls for show of force on the streets against US</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/irao-lider-pede-demonstracao-de-forca-nas-ruas-contra-eua/</link><description>Iran's supreme leader yesterday called on Iranians to use the 47th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution on Wednesday to demonstrate strength against the enemy, in a context of tensions with the United States.
Since 1979, “foreign powers have always sought to reestablish the previous situation”, declared Ali Khamenei, in reference to external influence during the Pahlavi dynasty (1925-1979), an ally of the Americans, which was removed from power by the revolution.
Led by the then 'ayatollah' Ruhollah Khomeini, Shiite fundamentalists established the Islamic Republic following the 1979 revolution, which deposed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last shah of Iran, formally called Persia until 1935.
“The power of a nation lies not so much in its missiles and planes, but in the will and resilience of its people,” said Khamenei, quoted by the France-Presse news agency (AFP).
“Show it again and thwart the enemy’s plans,” said the supreme leader, calling on Iranians to participate in the anniversary of the revolution.
“The presence of the people at the march and the expression of loyalty to the Islamic Republic will make the enemy retreat from its ambition against Iran and national interests,” said Khamenei, also quoted by the Spanish agency EFE.
The country's highest political and religious authority has assured that the demonstration of “national power” through unity will lead to “the discouragement of the enemy”.
Khamenei warned that, as long as the enemy is not discouraged, “he will not stop causing inconvenience” to the Iranians. He also mentioned that on February 11, 1979, the Iranian people achieved a “great victory by freeing the country from foreign intervention”.
Khamenei did not participate on Sunday in the annual meeting with the commanders of the Air Force, the first military body to join the 1979 revolution.
Blood in the streets
The speech comes at one of the Islamic Republic's most fragile moments, after the violent repression of protests against the regime and in the face of the threat of US military intervention if a nuclear agreement is not reached.
The demonstrations, which began on December 28th due to the devaluation of the currency in Tehran, spread throughout the country and were crushed on January 8th and 9th. The Iranian government admitted the deaths of 3,117 people, attributing the violence to the United States and Israel.
The non-governmental organization HRANA, based in North American territory, counted 6,961 deaths, and is still verifying more than 11 thousand possible deaths and 51 thousand arrests.
The UN special rapporteur for Iran, Mai Sato, said that medical reports point to the possibility of up to 20,000 deaths, although the United Nations highlights the difficulty of corroborating the data. Following the crackdown, authorities launched a wave of arrests of moderate political figures and activists.
At the same time, Iran and the United States resumed negotiations for a nuclear agreement last week, in the first meeting after the 12-day war between Tehran and Tel Aviv. The United States participated in the conflict by bombing Iranian nuclear facilities.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:31:54</pubDate></item><item><title>UTM | Cultural consultancy and promotion company created</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/utm-criada-empresa-de-consultadoria-e-promocao-cultural/</link><description>The Macau Tourism University (UTM) has created a new company that will dedicate itself to consulting in areas such as tourism, culture, research, training courses and even commercial investment management.

According to the Chinese Radio Macau channel, the fraud scheme was similar to all the victims and began with a comment from the alleged fraudster in social media posts made by women who wanted to go to concerts and had difficulty acquiring tickets.
One of the victims lost a total of 10,438 patacas, having started by transferring 6,000 patacas as payment for two tickets that the fraudster had arranged. Afterwards, the suspect said that the tickets were already sold out, promising a refund that never happened. The scammer also sent QR codes for victims to contact a fake employee from a financial department who would help with reimbursement, leading victims to transfer more money.
In this woman's case, another three thousand patacas were transferred, with the suspect claiming that the operation had not been successful, demanding more payments. Only then did the woman realize that she could be a victim of fraud and complained to the police. The Judicial Police (PJ) says it received complaints regarding five cases of fraud between the 6th and 8th of February, all of which are being investigated. There have been no arrests yet.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:09:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Book by Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni launched in Lisbon this week</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/livro-de-rui-leao-e-carlotta-bruni-lancado-em-lisboa-esta-semana/</link><description>This Friday, the 13th, in Lisbon, the launch of the book by local architects Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni, “Layering The City”, will take place at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. The session starts at 11:30 am and is part of the third International Congress on Colonial and Post-Colonial Landscapes, Architecture, Cities and Work, with a presentation by the authors themselves.
“Layering The City” is an investigation into infrastructures and public spaces in Macau, revealing the perspectives that Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni put into each project they undertake, with a focus on projects such as social housing in the Fai Chi Kei neighborhood, the Barra station and the Intermodal zone, related to the Light Rail.
As explained by Rui Leão in an interview with HM, the book is composed “of texts by some critics about our work”, namely Jorge Figueira, and an interview conducted by academic Ana Vaz Milheiro, also author of the preface.
In this book, there is the idea of ​​construction in layers, revealing the different perspectives of the two architects in each project they carry out. "There is work brought by each person to the project, which involves responding to the programmed request, what the client asks for, what lives in the alignment plan [of the project], or a series of issues at a civic level, public space or the right to quality of life. There are a series of social dimensions [to take into account to] make spaces for people, even when they are impossible [in terms] of politics and in the city. It is these layers that enter the projects and that, deep down, pass for creating opportunities to improve the life of the city, the person, the street”, said Rui Leão in the same interview.
Portuguese houses
Meanwhile, architect Rui Leão also participates, as co-curator, in the exhibition “Habitar Portugal 1974-2924″, opened this Wednesday, starting at 7pm, at the Architecture Center – Garagem Sul, at the Centro Cultural de Belém, in Lisbon.
This is an initiative that marks 50 years of Democracy through a selection of one hundred works of Portuguese Architecture, built in Portugal and around the world between 1974 and 2024”, with the team of curators Alexandra Saraiva and Célia Gomes.
According to the official description of the exhibition, available on the CCB website, what is sought is to look at architecture “as a political gesture; to highlight positions of rupture; to enhance the persistence of memories”. You can see projects such as the Hotel Dom Henrique, in Porto, designed by José Carlos Loureiro, or the Complexo das Amoreiras, by Tomás Taveira. Highlights include works such as the Côa Museum, by Camilo Rebelo and Tiago Pimentel, or the requalification project of Casa do Passal – Museu Aristides de Sousa Mendes, by the studio Rosmaninho + Azevedo.
This is the seventh edition of the “Habitar Portugal” exhibition, with one hundred works having been chosen “with different programs and different scales, guided by national and international representation (including the Portuguese expression built outside the country)”.
According to the same note, “this is a significant and valuable record that not only offers a panoramic look at the last quarter of the 20th century and the first of the 21st century, but also seeks to project the future of contemporary Portuguese architecture, and consequently the social, economic and territorial development of Portugal in the world”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:25:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Concert | South Korean group Treasure in Macau next month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/concerto-grupo-sul-coreano-treasure-em-macau-no-proximo-mes/</link><description>The Venetian Arena is preparing to host, on March 6th, another K-Pop concert, this time by the boy band Treasure. The group from South Korea, made up of ten members, was created in 2019 and was born in the context of a television program made to discover musical talents
The band Treasure, from South Korea, has only been alive for a few years, but their success seems to be guaranteed. Proof of this is the group's show that Macau will host on March 6th at the Venetian Arena, in Cotai, from 8pm, as part of the “Treasure Tour [Pulse On] in Macao”.
Treasure are a boy band formed in 2019 through the YG Treasure Box talent hunt program, which aimed to train this group of young singers. Of the more than 20 candidates, who had to pass several challenging tests to demonstrate their talent, the ten best voices were chosen. Currently, the group consists of Choi Hyun-suk, Jihoon, Yoshi, Junkyu, Yoon Jae-hyuk, Asahi, Doyoung, Haruto, Park Jeong-woo and So Jung-hwan.
The recipe of combining the creation of a group of singing boys with a television program seems to have worked, and the truth is that success was felt as soon as they started composing songs and publishing them on the market.
In August 2020, “BOY”, the first single, was released, and “The First Step: Chapter One” was also released that year. This record work was part of a trilogy of albums that, as a whole, sold more than a million copies in just five months.
According to the description of the show in Macau, available on the Venetian Arena website, it is said that the concert reveals how Treasure are “expanding their global influence”, as the first tour, just in Japan in 2023, included eight cities and 26 shows.
At that time, the tour attracted “almost 300,000 spectators and set the record for the highest audience for a debut tour by a Korean artist”.
The first tour in Asia followed, this time with 17 cities included and a total of 40 concerts. In 2024, Japan once again hosted a Treasure tour, which included two meetings with fans, while last year the “Treasure Fan Concert [Special Moment] took place. These moments were also revealing of the group's success, as together they “surpassed an accumulated audience of one million [people], demonstrating their status and the band's power in live performances”.
On the road since 2025
Treasure come to Macau with new songs under their belt. The third mini-album, titled “Love Pulse”, was released on September 1st, and in March it was time for the record market to receive “Pleasure”, a “special mini-album”.
The concert at the Venetian Arena is part of the group's tour that has marked Treasure's schedule since the second half of 2025. In October, the group gave three consecutive concerts in Seoul, and then performed again in Japan.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:24:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Nuclear | Largest nuclear power plant in the world reactivated</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/nuclear-reactivada-maior-central-nuclear-do-mundo/</link><description>The Japanese electricity company TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) yesterday reactivated the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa (KK) nuclear power plant, the largest in the world in terms of capacity and closed in 2011 after the accident in Fukushima.
“At 14:00, the control bars were removed and reactor number 6 of the nuclear plant was put into operation,” TEPCO said in a statement. The restart of the reactor had been suspended last January after an alarm was raised. The company added that it will continue to check “the integrity of the plant's equipment” and stated that it will respond “sincerely” to inspections by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority.
The company plans to gradually increase the amount of power generated at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa until it resumes commercial operations from March 18.
With a capacity of more than 8,000 megawatts (MW), the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant is a fundamental piece in TEPCO's energy supply plan and is in line with the strategy promoted by the Japanese Government of Sanae Takaichi to boost nuclear plants and meet emissions reduction targets.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:22:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism | Associations want activities in neighborhoods to attract visitors</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/turismo-associacoes-querem-actividades-nos-bairros-para-atrair-visitantes/</link><description>The president of the Macau Tourist Industry Association, Andy Wu, thinks that the Government can improve plans to attract tourists to residential neighborhoods, which are on the margins in terms of commerce for the many visitors who arrive in Macau.
Speaking to the newspaper Ou Mun, the businessman also argued that although last year the Government launched several activities in residential neighborhoods, the short duration of the initiatives did not allow them to create lasting impressions among tourists. Without asking for a daily schedule in these areas of the city, Andy Wu would like to see regular activities every weekend, in order to put places that are not normally visited “on the map” for tourists. Furthermore, the person responsible understands that transport to community neighborhoods must be improved to facilitate access for tourists.
With the Chinese New Year holidays next week, travel agency entrepreneur Paul Wong also indicated that the Government should continue to close areas of the city to traffic to divert visitors from the most popular tourist attractions.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:03:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>Iran's supreme leader yesterday called on Iranians to use the 47th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution on Wednesday to demonstrate strength against the enemy, in a context of tensions with the United States.
Since 1979, “foreign powers have always sought to reestablish the previous situation”, declared Ali Khamenei, in reference to external influence during the Pahlavi dynasty (1925-1979), an ally of the Americans, which was removed from power by the revolution.
Led by the then 'ayatollah' Ruhollah Khomeini, Shiite fundamentalists established the Islamic Republic following the 1979 revolution, which deposed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last shah of Iran, formally called Persia until 1935.
“The power of a nation lies not so much in its missiles and planes, but in the will and resilience of its people,” said Khamenei, quoted by the France-Presse news agency (AFP).

Shades of the color red were notoriously adopted by the emperors of the Ming dynasty who had Zhu, “vermilion or cinnabar” as their family name.

One of the chapters deals with philanthropy in Macau, the discreet profile of philanthropists and the work of entities such as Fundação Rui Cunha, Banco Nacional Ultramarino and Fundação Oriente
The University of São José (USJ) has just published the book “Media, Art &amp; Technology in the Nine Portuguese Speaking Cultures”, edited by professor José Manuel Simões. As the name indicates, the work aims to outline the panorama of arts, media and culture in the nine Portuguese-speaking countries and regions, which includes Macau.
Macao SAR is represented with a chapter dedicated to philanthropy, written by Carmen Zita Monereo, post-doctoral student at USJ, entitled “The Impact of Corporate Philanthropy on Media, Art, and Technology in Macao / What do we know about Philanthropy in Macao? What is the relationship between Confucianism, Philanthropy, Media, and strategic communication?”.
“Carmen has been developing a study on philanthropy in Macau, which is a slightly different work than the rest”, she began by telling HM José Manuel Simões. "This is a work that contributes to the analysis of the spectrum of philanthropists in Macau, then outlining a study on the Rui Cunha Foundation, Banco Nacional Ultramarino, Fundação Oriente. It looks at what corporate philanthropy is and the impacts it has on society through an analysis of the media, but also art and technology in Macau. In other words, it questions what we know about philanthropy in Macau and what is the relationship between Confucianism, philanthropy, the media and strategic communication.”
José Manuel Simões adds that one of the innovative points in this chapter is the discreet profile of philanthropists. “A curious aspect is that, unlike philanthropists from Europe and the United States, who really like to appear in rankings, in Macau there is greater discretion and a low profile of these people linked to philanthropy, and this has to do with the culture itself.”
The editor of the work adds that “in the field of communication sciences [in Macau] philanthropy has gained great importance as a communication instrument”, and that Carmen Zita Monereo’s work “identifies the values ​​of an organizational culture that is capable of generating communication flows conducive to innovation through this philanthropic activity”.
The book, which is available for free in digital version, “seeks to draw links between various vectors, and one of them is the nine Portuguese-speaking cultures”, without forgetting Macau “as a connection platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries”.
According to José Manuel Simões, it is a book “whose research was developed seeking to adopt a multidisciplinary approach”, having “an academic nature, but, at the same time, it aims to have a simple and accessible language”.
Cape Verde’s good example
With a bilingual edition, the book presents “a very broad spectrum” of themes, containing an article by José Manuel Simões on São Tomé and Príncipe, entitled “Digital Media Contribution to Entrepreneurship and Development in São Tomé and Príncipe”. Below is an article on the educational panorama in Angola and the use of artificial intelligence (AI), written by Wilson Gomes Caldeira, entitled “Angola’s higher education system: An analysis of the opportunities and challenges presented by Artificial Intelligence”.
In the case of Cape Verde, Silvino Lopes Évora explores the ideas of social communication in conjunction with AI, in “Artificial Intelligence, newsroom culture, and journalism: From international spectrum to experiences in Cape Verde”.
“Cape Verde is a good example of media development in Africa and Silvino Évora's text works on the AI ​​component in the media and how it is being inserted. [The text also analyzes] what are the possibilities for using AI and how ethics can monitor and support AI and, at the same time, journalism”, adds José Manuel Simões.
The book published by USJ also explores, in the chapter “The media system as a leverage for democratic development in East Timor”, by Paulo Faustino and Rui Alexandre Novais, the links between journalism and the historical memories of the independence process.
The book's editor explains the “more historical component regarding the role of remission that journalists still have today to almost preserve the memory of those who died in favor of the country's independence”.
"Journalism is of enormous importance in Timor, there were people and journalists who died. This is very little talked about and in this study there is an interesting conclusion, that these people, when they died in the name of freedom of expression, left a very important place in Timor-Leste that is still in force today, seeking to preserve their memory through surveillance over other powers."
In this way, “Timor-Leste is almost an example of how journalism should act as a watchdog of other powers, which does not happen in other sectors”.
José Manuel Simões highlights the case of Guinea-Bissau, “where journalists are called hired mouths”. "They don't know the difference between advertising, public relations, marketing and journalism, because they are conditioned by a very low salary. They write what they ask for in exchange for an envelope with some money inside, and this makes the profession [of journalism] very fragile in Guinea Bissau", he stressed.
A language of unity
According to José Manuel Simões, the book aims to unite “these quadrants of Portuguese cultures”, and the English edition aims to reach Anglo-Saxon communities, “so that they know about the existence of these cultures”.
"There are those who do not agree with me regarding the idea that the Portuguese language is a language of unity, not only among Portuguese-speaking peoples, but even within each country. We have the case of Timor-Leste, which on the island of Ataúro alone, which is very small, with 500 thousand inhabitants, has 40 dialects, one in each village. There, what does the Portuguese language do? It unites these people, because despite there being a difference between the who speak and those who learned Portuguese, in Timor-Leste, today, the elderly speak Portuguese and young people too, but there is the age group that goes from 25 to 50, who do not speak it. But, because it is a language of learning, because it is official, because it has books, a memory, Portuguese unites all these ethnicities and dialects, and has a common value, because the Portuguese language is everyone's mother tongue”, he explains.
José Manuel Simões does not forget the work that CPLP – Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, has done in this regard. "The CPLP had a wonderful idea of ​​uniting us through language, but the CPLP has done vague, limited and barely visible work. In fact, very few people have done a worthy job of creating links between new Portuguese-speaking cultures. In this sense, this book fills a gap and brings new data about these new cultures, with this technological and innovative dynamic", this in relation to the QR codes for all chapters of the book. Each code gives access to a video that summarizes the author's work in each chapter.
In global terms, “Media, Art &amp; Technology in the Nine Portuguese Speaking Cultures” aims to be comprehensive in areas such as technology, art, culture and social communication. There is, however, “a common denominator, creating, curiously, a certain harmony, even with different focuses, and ends up covering, directly and indirectly, the spectrum of social communication”, he concludes.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 02:56:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Diocese of Macau/450 years | New Catholic Center will have a hotel</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/diocese-de-macau-450-anos-novo-centro-catolico-tera-um-hotel/</link><description>The new Catholic Center should open “in the middle of the second quarter” of this year and will have a hotel, prepared to receive “pilgrims and tourists”, says the Diocese of Macau. At a time when the institution celebrates 450 years, the inauguration of the Catholic Center is based on “the vision” of D. Paulo José Tavares, bishop of Macau in the 60s and 70s
After many years of emptiness and construction work on the corner of Avenida da Praia Grande and Rua do Campo, the new Catholic Center is preparing to open its doors later this year and is perhaps the most important event in the celebration of the 450th anniversary of the Diocese of Macau.
HM asked questions to the Diocese of Macau regarding the reopening of the building, which confirmed that the official opening is scheduled “for the second quarter” of this year. This building, with a total of 17 floors, will have features designed for religious purposes, but also a hotel prepared to receive all types of people.
"The Catholic Center will be a nerve center for disseminating and sharing the mission of the Catholic Church. The lower floors will feature a chapel, an auditorium, conference rooms, exhibition areas and spaces for activities." While “the upper floors will function as a hotel, offering welcoming and comfortable accommodation, imbued with a spirit of service”.
In the diocese's written response, it is added that the hotel facilities “were designed to receive both pilgrims and tourists, welcoming Catholics and non-Catholics with hospitality and inclusion”.
It is worth remembering that in December employees began to be recruited for the hotel unit, in partnership with the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL). In a job matching session aimed at residents, held on December 5th, with the “Companhia de Gestão do Centro Católico”, 23 job openings were made available for sales manager, assistant reception manager, chef, head of security, room service supervisor and acquisition supervisor, reads the DSAL note released in November.
The Diocese of Macau did not want to tell HM how much it would cost to rebuild the new Catholic Center, saying only that initial forecasts had slipped due to the pandemic. "The Catholic Center is currently undergoing development and submission and approval by the Government. Following the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, construction costs have increased significantly. We are grateful for the understanding and support of the builders and contractors, which allowed the reconstruction project to be completed successfully. At the same time, we warmly welcome donations from all sectors of society to help sustain and carry forward the Catholic Center's original mission of serving the Macau community."
A bishop still present
Asked about the main goals of the new Catholic Center, the Diocese of Macau describes that the building “aims to continue the spiritual mission of the Catholic Church and incorporate the spirit of Christ”, influenced by the work of Bishop D. Paulo José Tavares, who carried out his mission in Macau in the mid-20th century.
Of particular note is the fact that D. Paulo José Tavares, who died in 1973 and was appointed Bishop of Macau in 1961, was important in maintaining the presence of the Catholic Church in Macau at the time of the “1,2,3” movement. Between November 1966 and February 1967, the Cultural Revolution manifested itself in the territory, bringing together many local students, who intended to change the content of Catholic education. D. Paulo José Tavares fought with these groups of protesters, managing to keep teaching in Catholic schools and the spirit associated with them unchanged.
In this way, and based on “the vision” of this bishop, the diocese intends for the new Catholic Center to “continue to serve as a vital bridge for the Macau community, promoting dialogue, exchange and integration of faith and culture”. It is also the intention to “open the doors [of the Center] to visitors from all over the world, reinforcing not only its role as a spiritual refuge, but also infusing new vitality into the religious and cultural panorama of Macau”.
António Pedro Costa, author of the cleric's biography, entitled “D. Paulo José Tavares – The diplomat bishop”, described, in an interview with HM in 2023, that the bishop “was a breath of fresh air”, and a figure cherished by the Chinese community at the time.
"These attitudes of valuing the Chinese community led to a rapprochement and the establishment of a relationship of trust. Only in this way was he able to take his objectives forward, as he realized that he had to have the population on his side. But this caused him a lot of trouble with the European clergy, who did not agree with D. Paulo José Tavares' stance. It meant that the population saw him as an ally and not a person who comes from outside and imposes his ideas", said the author.
A year of celebrations
It was in 1576, in the fourth year of the Wanli reign, of the Ming Dynasty, that the Diocese was founded in Macau, with January 23rd being the official date of celebration. However, the next few months will also be festive.
In a previously released statement, the Diocese of Macau states that it has had, over the years, “the mission of establishing bridges between East and West, promoting education, charity and pastoral service”, leaving “a deep and lasting mark on the cultural, educational and religious development of Macau”.
The theme of the celebrations is “From Macau to the World: 450 years of Mission and Mercy”. The new Catholic Center will host two thematic exhibitions, entitled “Honoring the Past, Creating the Future” and “Witness to Heritage, Mission in the World”. These exhibitions aim to “reflect the development of the Diocese from historical, personal and cultural perspectives, as well as its future directions”, highlights the same note.
Tomorrow a sacred music concert will take place at the Sé Church with eight choral groups from Macau, Hong Kong and the Province of Guangzhou, with the sounds of the church's new pipe organ being heard.
From 7:30 pm onwards, the Diocesan Choir of Macau, the Cathedral Schola ensemble and other choral groups from Macau will perform, such as Coro Perosi, Dolce Voce and Cantate Chorus, without forgetting other ensembles from Hong Kong and Guangzhou.
The Diocese highlights that the “most symbolic and large-scale initiative of the commemorative year” will be the “great celebration” scheduled for October 31st this year, which consists of a reception and mass.
“Through this solemn celebration, the Diocese will give thanks to God for the graces and mission granted over four and a half centuries, and will pray that He continues to guide the way forward”, the same statement describes.
There will also be initiatives carried out by “various diocesan institutions” in the coming months, namely “cultural shows, school competitions, academic symposiums, social activities, youth meetings, online training resources, parish initiatives and liturgical celebrations”.
“Through transversal and intergenerational participation, the commemorative year seeks to deepen public knowledge about the historical development of the Diocese and its service to the community, promoting the spirit of the diocesan motto ‘Scientia et Virtus’ (Science and Virtue), which inspires a practice of service based on the balance between knowledge and ethical care.”
At a time when it celebrates 450 years of existence, the Diocese says it wants to chart the future, “walking with the residents of Macau in reflecting on the past and continuing its mission of faith, service and culture in this new stage”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:36:50</pubDate></item><item><title>History | Book reveals how Macau was created in the image of Évora</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/historia-livro-revela-como-macau-se-fez-a-imagem-de-evora/</link><description>The local association Heritage Society has just released a two-volume book on the history of Macau's founding. Authored by Caspar Chan and Nathan Rubene dos Santos, “Foral of the City of the Name of the God, Macau”, contains translations and annotations of documents that show how the founding of Macau had Évora as a model

A book, divided into two volumes, has just been published by the local association Heritage Society, which helps tell the story of the founding of Macau, from the mid-16th century onwards. The two volumes are entitled “Foral of the City of the Name of the God, Macau: Évora of the Far East” and “The Twenty-eight Alvarás”, and are authored by academics Caspar Chan and Nathan Rubene dos Santos.
The first volume, which establishes a curious connection between Macau and Évora in the founding of the territory to the East, is based on the archive “Foral, Regalias e Privilégios Concedidos à Cidade de Macau, na China, 1596-1756”, the original of which is kept at the National Archives of Rio de Janeiro, and there are microfilms at the Macau Archive.
In turn, the part dedicated to the 28 charters, a continuation of the first volume, analyzes the 28 legal texts initially decreed by the then governor of Macau and viceroy of India, D. Rodrigo da Costa, in 1689. These documents were later confirmed by King D. João V, in Portugal, in 1709.
As the authors told HM, in a joint email interview, the first volume “deals with the first part of the archive, or the first 17 sheets, which concern the oldest founding letters, letters and sentences received by the Senate of Macau during the last years of the 16th century”.
The second volume analyzes the contents of the file between pages 17 and 33, covering the 28 permits. “This is not yet the complete story, as we intend to continue working on the remaining archive in future years”, confessed the authors.
The authors highlight the importance of the charter, an ancient document that consisted of “a charter or contract that the governing power, be it a feudal lord, a bishop or a king, establishes with a local entity, be it a village or city, a senate or a council”.
"We consider that the word and the concept are important to reflect on this historical period and not only in Macau, but also the time when the European kingdom [Portugal] was at the height of its expansion across the seas and oceans. The concept of charter implies the way in which a Portuguese social structure was being transplanted and rethought in Macau."
In this way, the authors add, all documents analyzed for these two volumes are related to the idea of ​​charter.
In turn, the designation “City of the Name of God of Macau” appears, in this specific file, “not only in the charter of King Philip I of Portugal, during the Iberian Union, which stipulates the elevation of Macau from a town to a city, but also throughout the 28 subsequent charters”.
In concrete terms, readers can come across “a research work that addresses some of the most important documents in the history of Macau, documents that inform us about the founding of the city and the evolution of its legal and governing tradition”.
The connection with Évora
The first volume of the work includes the subtitle “Évora of the Far East”, relating “the story in which the town's Senate presented a petition to the Viceroy of India for the recognition of the Senate, for the elevation of this port to the status of city and for the granting to the 'new city' of Macau of the privileges, rights and freedoms of the city of Évora”.
D. Duarte de Meneses, at the time governor of Macau and viceroy of India, ended up granting this request on behalf of King D. Filipe I, in 1586, a “decision that was later confirmed by the king himself in 1595”. “To confirm and corroborate that Macau had the same status as Évora, it became natural that all the founding documents of the city of Évora were transcribed to Macau, so that the Senate of Macau could preserve them as evidence and keep them in its archives as founding documents of the city”, explain the authors.
The documents found in the archive based in Rio de Janeiro point out that “the ‘proof’ of Macau’s status as a city comparable to Évora does not consist of a single document, but a compilation of several texts”.
In the first volume of the work there are examples such as “sentences on the jurisdiction of certain positions, such as the Prosecutor and the Almotacé, royal letters on specific issues, laws on which positions should be part of a Senate, rites of religious and funeral processions and even the configuration of the Senate room”.
In short, “everything that Évora possessed de jure during this period was inherited by Macau, as proven by the meticulous transcription and authentication of these documents”, explain the authors.
The survival permits
Regarding the second volume of the work, focused on the 28 permits, the authors understand that these documents “are particularly significant because they present themselves as a cohesive set, with great integrity in terms of language, format, administration and argumentation”.
For Caspar Chan and Nathan Rubene dos Santos, this results from the fact that, at the end of the 17th century, Macau was no longer in its golden period of trade, “due to the loss of commercial routes”.
"At the same time, Macau faced constant social unrest, both internally – for example, between the Senate, the Captain-General and the Ouvidor – and externally, in relations with the Chinese and Castilians. The privileges and rights of the Senate were not respected, and it was necessary to resolve ambiguities to guarantee the city's survival, as reflected in the various minutes of the Senate meetings."
Thus, a petition was presented by these bodies to governor D. Rodrigo da Costa “for the reaffirmation of the city's rights and to present solutions to various problems, such as the overflow of the jurisdiction of the Captain-General, the preservation of the Padroado in the face of foreign missionary groups and trade with the Chinese and in Solor and Timor”.
Thus, the 28 permits emerged, which “also deal with a very diverse group of people from different arts, professions, origins and ideologies”, and not just relations between Portuguese and Chinese, which made “this set of documents particularly interesting to study”.
The aim of publishing these two volumes was to facilitate access to the archive and its information. “We intend to place in the hands of Macau readers a fundamental document of the legal and political origin of the city, which remains little studied, even in Portuguese-speaking historiography, and which is almost completely absent from the daily historical imagination of Macau”, they add.
The archive based in Rio de Janeiro was translated by the authors “and was never published in full, especially the founding documents related to Évora, not even in Portuguese”.
This archive almost always appears “indirectly, as excerpts and paraphrases, such as those of canonical historians of Macau, in the case of Manuel Teixeira; or as references inserted in specialized works, and in some cases only through digitalized transcriptions that circulate in doctoral theses”.
In the case of permits, they are “better known among historians, but appear only in very limited publications”. "For this reason, the publication of the primary text itself becomes essential. By presenting it in English and Chinese, alongside Portuguese, we also seek to remove a barrier that has long structured Macau's historiography, dividing the city's documentary past into separate linguistic archives that rarely dialogue with each other", they conclude.
Caspar Chan and Nathan Rubene dos Santos also understand that “these volumes offer new answers in historiographical terms, because they show with renewed clarity that the legal existence of Macau emerged through the transplantation and local adaptation of the Portuguese municipality [Évora] as a governing idea on an Asian border”.
“At its core, the archive poses a fundamental question that often remains implicit: what counted as ‘Portuguese territory’ in its smallest civic unit, and how could this unit be reconstructed overseas through privileges, positions and jurisdiction, after Portugal had become global from the 15th century onwards?”
Local management
Regarding the relationship between Portugal and China at the time, the authors state that the work shows how “relations between China and Portugal in Macau were not carried out mainly through formal diplomacy between two distant courts, but through the daily management of coexistence by local institutions, in conditions of unequal jurisdiction”.
The first volume of the book shows how “the king elevated Macau from a town to a city and confirmed the elections of councillors, judges and officials because the Captain-Major appointed to China frequently left for the annual trip to Japan, remaining only a short time there and leaving the settlement without continuous leadership”.
The original document reveals that “this situation was especially dangerous in China, given Macau's distance from India and the fact that supplies could only be made during the annual trip”. In this way, “municipal government is presented as a necessity: a frontier city could not wait for an absent commander nor could it allow disorder.”
Thus, the authors add, “the privileges, jurisdiction and civic positions granted to Macau describe a political logic as much as a legal one, since the Portuguese presence depended on a permanent local body capable of maintaining peace and managing risks in a space where the superior authority was distant”.
Regarding the permits, they show what maintaining the stability of the territory entailed, as “the survival of Macau depended on remaining within the limits tolerated by the Chinese authority”.
"The Twenty-sixth Alvará, for example, is explicit in stating that the Chinese mandarinate did not accept Portuguese jurisdiction over Chinese subjects, especially when Christian creditors sought to arrest Chinese debtors. The Senate describes the expenses and dangers caused when a mandarin was sent to enforce such determinations and requests a direct solution: preventing Christians from contracting credits with the Chinese and denying them recourse to both the Ombudsman and the Chinese courts, so that the city could 'live in peace’. The Crown confirms this approach”, they conclude.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 05:40:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Cooperation | Relations between China and Timor-Leste guided by caution, study indicates</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/cooperacao-relacoes-entre-china-e-timor-leste-pautadas-por-cautela-indica-estudo/</link><description>It is certain that, by being part of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, Timor-Leste can become a strategic point in commercial relations on this side of the globe, despite the “cautious pragmatism” in relations with China. The conclusion is a study on Timorese foreign policy within the scope of the Chinese initiative, authored by three Portuguese academics
Timor-Leste, a young country, has been cementing its relations with China, namely through the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, but there is still some caution surrounding this relationship. This is one of the conclusions of the study “Timor-Leste's foreign policy options within the scope of China's Belt and Road 2.0 Initiative: a small state perspective”, authored by academics Tiago Botelho dos Santos, Diogo Borges and Paulo Afonso Duarte. The work was published in The Pacific Review, an academic journal edited by Taylor &amp; Francis.
The research work starts with Timor-Leste's adherence to the Chinese initiative, something that happened in 2017, to analyze how the relationship with China has been going, taking into account the fact that Timor-Leste has “the status of a small state”.
It is concluded, therefore, that “Timor-Leste's involvement with China's Belt and Road Initiative, particularly in the post-2023 period, can be understood as a strategic and calculated attempt to maximize its status as a small state in a complex regional and global environment”. It is described that, in this period, Timorese foreign policy has been characterized “by a multi-vector approach, strategically anchored in multilateralism”, seeking to “diversify international partnerships to reinforce national security, promote economic development and expand its voice in the international system”.
The study points out that relations between Timor-Leste and China, in the context of the Belt and Road initiative, are a “deliberate movement to leverage development opportunities” in the country, being a strategy aligned with the Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030.
The plan aims to “promote economic diversification and the development of critical infrastructure, in a context in which the Belt and Road 2.0 Initiative emphasizes digital infrastructure, green energy and cooperation in the area of ​​health”.
Timorese potential
The three academics also highlight that Timor-Leste, as part of the Chinese geopolitical initiative, has the potential to stand out economically, and also in commercial terms, in the region. The country has “the potential to assert itself as a logistical center on a route that connects the South Indian Ocean to the South Pacific”, so the Chinese initiative “offers a relevant opportunity to significantly increase its regional prominence and decisively facilitate” integration into ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations], to which Timor-Leste recently joined.
Despite all these positive signs, the study concludes that “although Timor-Leste's relationship with China has deepened, culminating in a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2024, its engagement continues to be marked by cautious pragmatism”.
In this context, “the benefits of greater connectivity and investment are carefully weighed against concerns regarding debt sustainability, transparency and possible strategic dependencies”. This caution on the part of Timor-Leste demonstrates its “capacity for action by selectively engaging in projects aligned with its national interests”, navigating the “complexities of competition between great powers in the Indo-Pacific, while maintaining its commitment to a balanced and diversified foreign policy”.
Timorese pragmatism is also evident, according to the study, in the fact that the country “not only optimizes development opportunities, but also reinforces its regional position by meticulously analyzing economic benefits in the face of potential risks”. What is strengthened, “ultimately”, is the “capacity for action as a small State”, highlight the authors.
A “remarkable” ability
The study in question highlights how Timor-Leste has had “a remarkable capacity for action” in the context of the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, using other small States, such as Sri Lanka, as a point of comparison.
Citing other studies, the three academics highlight how “Timor-Leste has demonstrated a more cautious approach than countries like Sri Lanka, which have faced significant concerns about debt sustainability associated with BRI [Belt and Road Initiative] projects, or landlocked states like Laos and coastal nations like Cambodia.”
In the case of these Southeast Asian countries, “Chinese loans for emblematic projects, such as railways and highways, have drastically increased external debt and dependence on Beijing”.
What we sought to do in this investigation was “to examine the unique position of Timor-Leste, not as a financier, but also not as a victim of a ‘debt trap'”, highlighting “the distinct and valuable form of action capacity of a small State within the scope of the BRI”.
The authors highlight that, in the last decade, China “significantly expanded its presence in Southeast Asia” through the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, thereby “expanding its regional influence in the economic, security and political spheres”. In this relationship, Timor-Leste has been “far from being a passive observer”, seeking to “actively engage with China to ensure development benefits”.
Timor-Leste sought to “identify an opportunity to align with the long-term objectives” of its Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030, analysts indicate.
“Strategically, the country also intends to capitalize on its geographic position in emerging commercial maritime routes, particularly through the establishment of a logistics hub in the South Indian Ocean and the South Pacific, potentially reinforcing its regional role as a new integrated member state of ASEAN”, point out the authors.
Timor-Leste seeks to “balance economic gains and potential dependencies”, in a geopolitical context that “includes competition between great powers in the Indo-Pacific, where United States policies, under successive administrations, aim to contain China's regional influence”.
In methodological terms, the authors carried out this investigation based on reading official reports, documents that serve as the basis for signed bilateral agreements and government documentation. In addition, interviews were carried out with “experts based in both Europe and Asia”.
The authors state that they sought to interview academics and diplomats “due to the fact that ordinary citizens are generally unfamiliar with China's global multilateral initiatives, while diplomats tend to be excessively cautious in their statements, as they represent the official position of their state, and not necessarily their personal opinions”.
It is therefore understood that academics “tend to offer more balanced and rigorous analyses”. The questions focused on how Timor-Leste, as a small State, has benefited from the Chinese initiative, whether this initiative is compatible with the Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030, or whether “there are visible dangers of creating dependency” between the two countries, among other issues.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 01:54:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Portugal prepares to choose the next President of the Republic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/eleicoes-portugal-prepara-se-para-escolher-o-proximo-presidente-da-republica/</link><description>Portugal goes to the vote on Sunday to choose the next President of the Republic. Of the 11 candidates, only two have representatives from Macau: Bessa Almeida from the PSD, and Neto Valente from the PS. The former president of the Macau Lawyers Association highlights that António José Seguro “does not join in provocations against China”, while Bessa Almeida considers that Marques Mendes is the right man for the moment


 
Eleven candidates will vote on Sunday to choose the next President of the Portuguese Republic, for a five-year term. This is a record number, with only seven having the support of political parties. Running for the position is Luís Marques Mendes, supported by the Social Democratic Party (PSD), and who appointed António Bessa Almeida as his representative in the Macao SAR. Next comes António José Seguro, with the support of the Socialist Party (PS), which has Jorge Neto Valente, president of the Macau Portuguese School Foundation and lawyer, as his representative. They are the only candidates for the Presidency of the Republic who chose figures as representatives of the Macao SAR.
The remaining candidates are Henrique Gouveia e Melo, João Cotrim de Figueiredo, Catarina Martins, António Filipe, André Ventura Jorge Pinto, Manuel João Vieira, André Pestana and Humberto Correia.
To HM, António Bessa Almeida, PSD activist and explained the reasons for supporting Marques Mendes. “At the time Portugal is going through, the country needs a candidate like Marques Mendes, who has a deep understanding of the different policies”, he began by pointing out.
Asked about the type of actions developed in Macau to attract the electorate to vote for Marques Mendes, Bessa Almeida simply mentioned that “the campaign in Macau is totally different from that in Portugal”, and the actions developed involve “what the candidate does in close proximity to the people, passing on information”.
For Bessa Almeida, “the electorate in Macau, on the Chinese side, is also made up of Portuguese”, and that “they have been following these elections like any other Portuguese, with confident visions for the future of Portugal”.
On January 6th, the president released a note highlighting the importance of Marques Mendes' candidacy, who is currently far from the top spots in the polls. "We have always been concerned with everything related to Portugal and at this moment, at a global level, political changes are sudden and unexpected. That is why we need a visionary president, experienced and thoughtful in guiding the destinies of Portugal and Portuguese people born and living outside the country."
 
A safe return
In Portugal, polls relating to the presidential elections have taken place almost daily, and show a change in the choice of candidates. If initially António José Seguro was somewhat removed from the top positions, a survey carried out by the Universidade Católica Portuguesa for RTP, Antena 1 and the Público newspaper, between the 6th and 9th of January and released this week, shows how Seguro is in a technical tie with André Ventura, Chega's candidate, guaranteeing 23 percent of voting intentions, when Ventura collects 24 percent. João Cotrim de Figueiredo comes in third place, with 19 percent, with the possibility of going to the second round of elections, followed by Marques Mendes and Gouveia e Melo with 14 percent.
Another survey, this time for TVI, CNN, TSF and Jornal de Notícias, with data collected on the 10th, 11th and 12th of January, shows Seguro with 23.9 percent of voting intentions, followed by Cotrim de Figueiredo with 20.8 percent and Ventura with 20.5 percent. Marques Mendes falls to fifth place, with 13.2 percent.
Seguro chose, in the Macao SAR, Jorge Neto Valente as his agent, who did not answer HM's call. In a statement published in the newspapers this Wednesday, the former president of the Macau Lawyers Association declared that Seguro “proposes a vision of the future based on the modernization of the country, the valorization of education and a commitment to innovation”. Referring specifically to Portugal-China relations, Neto Valente highlights that “unlike other candidates, Seguro does not support China's provocations regarding the status of Taiwan, and is also a candidate who “knows Portugal, Europe and the world”.
Neto Valente also stated that Seguro “is a decent man”. “He participated in all debates, showed politeness, defended his ideas firmly, was never excessive in his language and, unlike others, did not insult opponents or make malicious insinuations toward them.”
 
A “consistent course”
Paulo Pisco, leader of the Insurance campaign for emigration, reminded HM that the candidate “even expressed the opinion that, given that it was an in-person vote [for the presidential elections], the Government could have done much more, namely complying with what the electoral law for the Presidency of the Republic says, which is the possibility of opening more polling stations”.
Seguro also defended, according to Paulo Pisco, “that mobility voting could also have been applied, based on the experience previously carried out in the last elections for the European Parliament”.
Paulo Pisco states that António José Seguro has followed a “very consistent, solid and objective path”, which has allowed him to reach the top of the polls. Regarding the emigrated electorate, the deputy highlights that Seguro “has not deviated from the purposes, form and values ​​with which he intends to exercise the Presidency of the Republic”.
Furthermore, it is “a guarantor of the stability of the political system and also of democracy”. “This image that the candidate António José Seguro has shown throughout his career has earned him greater receptivity from voters”, highlighted Paulo Pisco.
The president does not forget that “Seguro is the candidate who has the most representatives per country in our diaspora”. "There are 18, ten in Europe and eight outside Europe. I believe that this substantiates a very firm commitment from the candidate to the exercise of his functions as President of the Republic, and to the relationship he intends to have with the diaspora", he stressed.
Looking at the candidates lower down in the polls, we have many faces from the left. The same survey with data collected on the 10th, 11th and 12th of January places Catarina Martins, from Bloco de Esquerda, with 2.5 percent; followed by António Filipe, from PCP, with 1.4 percent, head to head with Jorge Pinto, from Livre, who has 1.3 percent.

The Hong Kong society system dominates the group of topics present in news about depression, representing 34.83 percent of the articles analyzed, followed by topics such as law enforcement, with 18.81 percent, or the global economic recession in third place.
This is the main conclusion of the study “Analyzing Themes, Feelings, and Coping Strategies Regarding Online News Coverage of Depression in Hong Kong: Mixed Methods Study”, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research last year. The study was authored by Chen Sihui, Cindy Sing and Yangna Hu, from Hong Kong Polytechnic University; and Cecília Cheng, from the University of Hong Kong.
The study is focused on online news coverage about depression in the neighboring region, namely from publications such as the South China Morning Post and Hong Kong Free Press, and sought to understand the dominant themes and the emotional charge of the texts, whether they were positive or negative, among other issues.
Thus, the study reveals that the region's “societal system” was at the origin of 34.83 percent of news about depression, that is, 848 out of a total of 2,435, followed by the theme of “law enforcement”, representing 458 of all news analyzed, with a share of 18.81 percent. This is followed, in third place, by the theme of “global recession”, with 17.4 percent of responses; “lifestyle”, with 8.05 percent; “leisure”, with 11.21 percent of responses; “health issues”, with 6.94 percent and, finally, “United States politics”, representing just 3.12 percent of the news.
The study therefore describes that analyzing the sentiment inherent to the news, “it becomes evident that the societal system presented a more negative inclination”, being “related to several systems of Hong Kong society, including health, social, family, education and work”.
Between extradition and covid-19
The collection of online news was carried out between February 2019 and May 2024 “with the aim of examining the most recent representation of depression, especially during and after the period of social unrest and the covid-19 pandemic”.
The articles were chosen based on three criteria, one of which was accessibility to readers without a paid subscription, in addition to the fact that the website in question “should allow the retrieval of a sufficient quantity of depression-related news (i.e., more than 20) to ensure adequate data for subsequent analyses.” Websites with news in English were also chosen. Then, separate searches were carried out using the keywords “depression” and “depressed”.
The dates chosen for this study relate to two events. One of them was in February 2019, with the introduction of the proposed law on extradition to China, entitled “Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment)”. This “triggered protests and marches in Hong Kong due to political differences, leading to a significant increase in cases of depression, worsened in 2020 with the outbreak of Covid-19”.
The authors reveal that there were “peaks in coverage” of news related to depression, namely in April and May 2020 and in July 2023. Covid-19 followed as a second occurrence.
In the case of news from 2020, the study finds that “confinement measures due to covid-19 strongly affected Hong Kong, contributing to a more depressive mood”, and this period “corresponded to the second wave of the covid-19 outbreak”. The second pandemic wave led to strong confinement measures such as the closure of schools, “remote work policies and the ban on in-person meals in restaurants”.
The closure of schools, “as reported in the news, resulted in increased rates of depression among children and anxiety among parents, who had to simultaneously care for their children and elderly people at home.”
“In addition, conflicts between work and family also intensified due to the interruption of the normal work routine”, namely “the absence of office space and unclear working hours”, which “was associated with depressive feelings”, it is described.
In turn, in 2023 there was an “increase in reported suicide cases”, especially because Coco Lee, “an influential star who faced depression, died by suicide at home, which generated greater awareness about the need to expand support services in the area of ​​mental health and improve accessibility, with helplines frequently being highlighted”.
A certain stigma
With regard to the second most common topic found in the news, “law enforcement”, the study highlights that it also causes “a negative feeling”. “The volume of news reached peaks in November 2020 and August 2019”, and in 2020, “individual crimes and legal proceedings were mainly reported, with emphasis on the case of a Hong Kong teacher who murdered his wife, which may have caused a great social shock and public attention”.
The authors explain that, in this case, “depression was frequently cited in the news as an explanation for the perpetrator's illegal actions, which can reinforce stigmatizing attitudes and portray people with depression as violent, dangerous and more likely to commit crimes”.
Other topics that also showed “negative trends” are “health issues” and “United States politics”, with topics such as “lifestyle” or “leisure” “tending towards more positive feelings”.
With regard to another theme associated with news about depression, that of the “global recession”, the focus is the “economic difficulties caused by the spread of covid-19 in different sectors”, presenting “a more contradictory positive feeling”. In other words, “the structure of the reports initially described the economic challenges, to then emphasize the initiatives to facilitate recovery in response to the crisis”.
Thus, the authors note that “a significant change in general sentiment was observed”, as “until January 2021, the continuous decrease in the amount of positive news was interrupted”, and that afterwards “the aggregate number of positive news exceeded that of negative news almost every month, signaling a general change from a negative feeling to a more positive feeling in relation to the economic circumstances discussed”.
The authors consider that the change may be due “to the fact that people have been forced to adapt to a ‘new normal’ and begin the recovery of the economy, health, and society after a year of living with the pandemic”. Regarding the theme of US politics found in news associated with depression, the texts “emphasized rivalry and the presidential electoral process, as well as politicians from different parties who experienced depression”.
Few institutional responses
The study also looked at so-called coping strategies, that is, cognitive or behavioral efforts used to deal with less good situations. And here, the news analyzed focused mainly on “information about skills and resources” available to help people with depression, such as “support lines for suicidal intentions and suicide prevention”. Mental health programs provided by local organizations were also presented, such as Mind HK, the Kely Support Group and the Mental Health Association of Hong Kong, and articles were written about “counseling services and therapies for people with depression”, or even physical exercise recommendations.
The authors highlight that, when analyzing the news, they noticed “the insufficiency of political interventions, institutional support and financial assistance for individuals with depression, which indicates a deficiency at the societal level of coping strategies and which are present in journalistic coverage”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 02:06:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Higher education | Academic highlights growth of the sector in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/13/ensino-superior-academico-destaca-crescimento-do-sector-em-macau/</link><description>In “Macau, networks, dialogues and affections – The consolidation of the Portuguese-speaking community of China studies”, academic Pedro Steenhagen argues that Macau is taking great strides to be a bridge at an academic level with Portuguese-speaking countries, despite “still having a long way to go to achieve its goals”
The article “Macau, networks, dialogues and affections – The consolidation of the Portuguese-speaking community of China studies”, written by academic and doctoral student Pedro Steenhagen, has just been published in Revista Sinóptica, an editorial project of the Observa China portal. The article highlights the role that the Macao SAR can play in connecting its higher education system with Portuguese-speaking countries, and the growing importance it has had in this area.
“The aforementioned efforts in the field of education are not just rhetorical”, he described in the article, noting that “in relatively few decades, the Asian nation has become a true power in the area”. Pedro Steenhagen is based on two world rankings to assess the quality of higher education in the world, namely the World University Rankings 2026 by Times Higher Education (from 2025), which shows how “Macau, a small special administrative region in China, has three ranked universities: University of Macau (145), University of Science and Technology of Macau (251-300) and University of the City of Macau (601-800)”, these data being related to positions occupied in the ranking.
“Very interestingly, MSAR universities have experienced tremendous growth; for example, the University of Macau has seen a jump of more than 250 positions in the ranking in the last 10 years”, highlights the author of the article. In his view, these data translate into the fact that Macao SAR “assumes an increasingly relevant leadership role in the area of ​​education and research”.
Furthermore, it has “the best university in the Portuguese-speaking world in its territory, is experiencing an intense expansion of the education and research sector and serves as a fundamental axis for the exchange of people and the promotion of knowledge”.
Taking the rankings into account, Pedro Steenhagen's article recalls that China “has five [universities] in the top 50 in the world: Tsinghua University (12), Beijing University (13), Fudan University (36), Zhejiang University (39) and Shanghai Jiaotong University (40)”, with the Times Higher Education ranking “showing a total of 97 results for mainland China”.
Brazil, as “the largest Portuguese-speaking country on the globe, has a total of 59 results, and its five best universities are: University of São Paulo (201-250), State University of Campinas (351-400), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (601-800), Universidade Estadual Paulista (601-800) and Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (601-800)”.
In the case of Portugal, there are 16 results, with the five best higher education establishments being the University of Coimbra, University of Lisbon, University of Porto, Universidade Nova de Lisboa and ISCTE-Instituto Universitário de Lisboa.
Looking at the remaining Portuguese-speaking countries, Pedro Steenhagen highlights how “Mozambique has only one presence in the ranking”, with Eduardo Mondlane University, while “no other Portuguese-speaking country has ranked universities”.
A long way
Despite the good results, Pedro Steenhagen points out that “the Macao SAR still has a long way to go to achieve all its goals”. However, “its enormous potential as a regional and global protagonist in areas such as technology and innovation, sustainable tourism, creative industry, finance and, particularly, teaching, research and people exchange is already quite clear”.
The academic article refers to the “Lusophony component and the unique connection with the PLPs [Portuguese-speaking countries] which adds even more dynamism to its ambitions and to a trajectory that can already be considered incredibly successful since its retrocession”, that is, the transition of the Portuguese administration of Macau to China, in 1999.
In the case of the University of Macau (UM), the first to emerge in Macau, and which is now celebrating 45 years of existence, “it has the largest Portuguese department in Asia”, it is highlighted in the article, in addition to having “two research centers: the Research Center for Portuguese-Asian Studies and the Chinese-Portuguese Bilingual Teaching and Training Center”, with “its growing internationalization movement being notable”.
Pedro Steenhagen counts the “student exchange programs with more than 10 Brazilian universities”, in addition to the strengthening of “collaboration in teaching and research via international alliances, such as the Association of Portuguese Language Universities, and the establishment of the Center for Judicial and Legal Studies of China and Portuguese-speaking Countries”.
The example of the City University of Macau (UCM) is mentioned, where the Institute for Research on Portuguese-Speaking Countries is established, with “unique programs” of master's and doctoral degrees in Studies of Portuguese-Speaking Countries.
By establishing partnerships with ISCTE-IUL, UCM is in a “position at the forefront of academic programs and initiatives that go beyond purely linguistic and cultural issues” in connection with Portuguese-speaking countries.
There is also the example of a private higher education institution, the University of São José, which “signed [agreements], for example, with the Federal University of Ceará and the Portuguese Catholic University, not only to bring closer relations on a bilateral basis, but also to promote joint projects”.
The place of the Government
Pedro Steenhagen also refers to the intervention of the Macao SAR Government in connecting with the Portuguese-speaking world, namely the Directorate of Economic and Technological Development Services and the Macau Business Incubation Center for Young People, which have held the Macau Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition for Technology Companies from Brazil and Portugal since 2021.
Of note is the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in Lisbon and the Macau Houses spread around the world which, “together with international initiatives such as the Meeting of Macanese Communities, contribute not only to the vitality of intellectual exchanges, but also to the cultivation of memory and affective ties between Macau, the diaspora, descendants and Portuguese-speaking communities”.
“Associations such as the Association of Brazilian Studies in Macau and the Industrial and Commercial Association of Macau offer substance, in a complementary way to universities and research institutes, for strengthening relationships, developing networks and generating increasingly fruitful dialogues between the parties involved”, it further reads.
Pedro Steenhagen is a doctoral candidate in the field of International Politics at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs at Fudan University, and president of the Brazilian Citizens' Council in Shanghai. On the Observa China platform, he is development director and coordinator of the China-Brazil and Lusofonia Relations Center. The platform is a think-tank created in 2020 by “a group of young professionals and students with the mission of creating a network to qualify the debate on China in Portuguese”, reads the website.</description><pubDate>2026-01-13 01:02:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Food safety | Requests for improvements in supervision</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/seguranca-alimentar-pedidas-melhorias-na-supervisao/</link><description>The assemblyman linked to the Fujian community is concerned about the transport of food in the case of food platforms and also the most recent recalls of baby products
Following cases of baby products being withdrawn from the market and reports of food poisoning in local luxury restaurants, MP Chan Lai Kei wants the Government to strengthen food supervision. The request is contained in a written interpellation, released yesterday.
According to the deputy linked to the Fujian community, although the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) announced that last year the general approval rate for inspections carried out through food sampling was 99 percent, food safety faces more and new challenges.
In relation to baby products, taking into account the recent cases of food recalls, such as powdered milk, the deputy wants to know whether the authorities will be more demanding in providing information on the origin and route of the items.
“Neighboring regions have already established a ‘baby food tracking labeling system,’ requiring importers to provide full information about the production chain so that parents can check the food’s journey via a QR code,” Chan wrote. “Will the IAM move forward with the establishment of a ‘special supervision plan for children’s foods’, implementing more frequent tests for powdered milk and children’s complementary foods, as well as regularly publishing the safety levels of brands?”, he asked.
Dangers of take-away
Other challenges arise associated with the progressive increase in the number of visitors and a new culture of take-away not only for food, but also for drinks.
According to Chan, the number of orders on take-away platforms continues to rise every year. However, during transport and waiting times, the deputy indicates that there is no temperature control or hygiene regulations, due to “regulatory gaps”. This is an aspect that the deputy hopes to see changed: “How will the authorities reinforce interdepartmental cooperation, and formulate mandatory standards for the hygiene of take-away boxes, time limits for delivery and separation of packaging when transporting hot and cold food […]?” question.
Chan Lai Kei also suggests using digital methods to remotely control food, with random inspections.
In the document, the legislator also points out that Macau welcomes more than 40 million visitors annually, and that banquets and festivals are frequent, which increases food risks. For this reason, Chan Lai Kei suggests that the Government draw up a food safety response plan during the peak tourism season so that it can quickly trace the origin of any poisoning.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:02:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Presidential | Seguro wins elections in Macau and nationally</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/presidenciais-seguro-ganha-eleicoes-em-macau-e-a-nivel-nacional/</link><description>The former leader of the Socialist Party will be the future President of the Republic of Portugal, succeeding Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. When 20 parishes still needed to be counted, where the elections were postponed due to bad weather, Seguro collected 66.82 percent of the votes
António José Seguro was the winner of the elections and will be the future President of the Republic of Portugal, after having achieved 66.82 percent of the votes (3.4 million votes), against André Ventura's 33.18 percent (1.7 million votes). The candidate linked to the Socialist Party also won in Macau, where he obtained 68.53 percent of the votes, against 31.47 percent for the candidate supported by Chega.
In relation to the territory, a total of 1,403 voters were counted, with Seguro collecting 934 votes and Ventura 429 votes. There were also 32 blank votes (2.28 percent) and eight invalid votes (0.57 percent).
The results show that there were 971 fewer people voting in the second round in Macau than in the first, when 2,374 votes had been recorded. The abstention rate for the second round among the 57,748 voters reached 97.45 percent, with those voting at 2.43 percent.
In the first round, Luís Marques Mendes, a candidate supported by the Social Democratic Party, received the most votes and received 1,073 votes, a figure above that which now contributed to guaranteeing the presidency to António José Seguro. In the first vote, the participation rate was 4.11 percent, which represented an abstention of 95.98 percent. In this round of voting, António José Seguro came in second place, with 477 votes and André Ventura in third, with 282 votes.
China was safe
Yesterday's results were provisional, as there were still 20 parishes to be counted in Portugal and seven “consulates” abroad.
Among the so-called “consulates” by the National Elections Commission, the results from Beijing remained to be determined. However, the votes from Macau combined with those from Shanghai gave Seguro victory, with 944 votes, against Ventura's 432. In Shanghai, Seguro obtained 10 votes, against three for Ventura, with no blank or invalid votes being recorded.
Despite the results in China, Ventura managed to be the most voted abroad with 51.88 percent of the votes (42,265) against 48.12 percent for Seguro (39,208), while blank votes were 1.21 percent and invalid votes were 0.65 percent.
“Working for Portugal”
In his victory speech, António José Seguro promised to work to develop the country and presented himself as the “president of all Portuguese”, even those who did not vote for him. “As the future President of the Republic, I add that from tonight onwards we are no longer adversaries and we now have a shared duty to work for a more developed and fairer Portugal”, stated the winner of the night, in a speech given in Caldas da Rainha. “The majority that elected me disappears tonight [Sunday]”, he added.

“The transformation [of the diploma] into a concrete legal system and the improvement of the high-level ‘architecture’ of the national security operating structure are in line with the fundamental requirements of Macau’s governance, in accordance with the law”, said Chui, son of deputy Chu Sai Peng and nephew of former Chief Executive Chui Sai ON, in statements cited by Canal Macau. “This approach also promotes the rule of law and the institutionalization and normalization of national security work, with the ultimate aim of establishing a more robust and stable legal safeguard for the long-term stability and sustained prosperity of the Macao SAR,” he added.
According to the future requirements of the diploma that will still be voted on in the Legislative Assembly, the commission will have all the powers to veto the participation of lawyers in cases.

In the first session of a public consultation, representatives of two of the most important traditional associations in the territory defended the extension of paternity leave, currently set at just five working days.
A leader from the General Union of Residents' Associations of Macau said that paternity leave should be extended up to 15 days or, alternatively, part of the leave could be taken by the father.
The representative, surnamed Sit, argued that the measure could help the father to take a more active role, particularly in the first months of the baby's life, especially if the mother is still recovering from a cesarean section.
A representative of the General Association of Women of Macau also called for the strengthening of paternity leave, to encourage fathers to take care of their children and “promote gender equality”.
But Maria Chu Pui Man, director of the Directorate of Labor Affairs Services (DSAL), rejected the appeals and said only that the father could, as is currently the case, take days off to support the family after the birth.
The public consultation, running until March 16, is based on a proposal from DSAL to extend maternity leave in the private sector from 70 to 90 days – an amount already applied to public administration employees – with the costs to be shared between the Government and employers.
Vacations on the agenda
The authorities also want to increase annual leave in the private sector, based on seniority. For 40 years, permanent residents of Macau have been entitled to just six paid days of rest annually. Civil servants are entitled to 22 working days.
The territory's Executive proposes that workers have the right to one more working day of vacation for every two years they spend in the same company, up to a maximum of 12 working days per year.
One of the objectives of the changes, said DSAL director Chan Un Tong on January 30, is to allow the population of Macau “to achieve a better balance between work and family life”.
In 2025, the Government commissioned a study “from a third entity” – whose identity was not revealed – on the possible increase in maternity leave and annual leave, which was completed at the end of the year. The study included a survey, according to which workers consider both the current maternity leave and the annual leave period “insufficient to meet family needs”.
World leaders
Asked by Lusa about the potential impact of changes in the birth rate in Macau, which in 2024 was the lowest in the world, Chan Un Tong replied that the objective is to “improve workers’ right to rest”.
In 2025, Macau registered 2,871 newborns, a drop of 20.4 percent and the lowest number of births in almost 50 years, said on January 1, the deputy director of Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário, Tai Wa Hou.
Macau recorded just 0.58 births per woman in 2024, far from the value needed to replace generations (2.1), the lowest fertility rate ever in the region and the lowest in the world, according to official data.
This value is even lower than the estimate made in a report released in July by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA): 0.68 births per woman.
Although more optimistic, the UNDESA estimate already indicated that Macau would have the lowest birth rate in the world in 2024, a long way from the second jurisdiction on the list, Singapore, with 0.95 births per woman.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 03:53:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Mental Health | Deputies ask for better monitoring of students</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/09/saude-mental-deputados-pedem-melhor-acompanhamento-de-alunos/</link><description>With the number of requests for help from students rising, deputies Lam Lon Wai and Loi I Weng want more commitment from the Government to improve mental health, and call for the use of artificial intelligence
Deputies Lam Lon Wai and Loi I Weng advocate the use of newer technologies, mainly artificial intelligence, to monitor the mental health of young people in Macau. This is how legislators reacted to the most recent data published by the Juvenile Monitoring Section of the Judicial Police.
According to authorities, last year 250 requests for assistance were made by minors with symptoms of emotional disturbance or stress, which corresponded to an increase of 64 percent year on year. The increase was the sharpest in the Macao SAR since there are records.
In a statement, Lam Lon Wai, who is also deputy director of the Secondary School for Workers' Sons and Brothers, argued that to ensure the healthy growth of students, it is necessary to establish a cooperation mechanism between family, school, Government and society.
The deputy stated that the family is the first line of defense, so parents should pay more attention to their children's changes in mood, their friendships, and internet use, particularly during long holidays. The deputy director also indicated that parents must monitor their children very closely to identify signs of risk.
Role of schools
Furthermore, Lam Lon Wai pointed out that schools must continue to invest in education for life, mental health and legal education for young people, so that students develop correct values, as members of society.
From Lam's perspective, this role must be complemented by the Government and society by strengthening support for mental health and developing help channels. Promotion must use social media to be more comprehensive.
For her part, the deputy and also deputy director of the General Women's Association School, Loi I Weng, argues that the Government should use artificial intelligence to monitor the mental health of young people in schools, through data collection and analysis, to identify and intervene in potential cases.
The official also hopes that the Government will provide schools with more resources to alleviate the workload of assistants who are on the front line and to increase the quality and effectiveness of these monitoring services.
The issue of mental health gained predominance during the pandemic and post-pandemic years, with data growing steadily. Authorities dealt with this increase by opting out of releasing statistics.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 03:02:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Research | Epstein and Bannon discussed Wynn and Adelson’s “weaknesses”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/09/investigacao-epstein-e-bannon-discutiram-fragilidades-de-wynn-e-adelson/</link><description>Macau appears in more than 200 files in the “Epstein Library”, mostly in articles relating to casino revenue and the investment environment. However, conversations with Steve Bannon emerge about Trump's lack of respect towards Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson, as well as notes from a sexual predator about a visit to Macau
With millions of files still to be released, and with the last update made last Friday, Macau appears in 208 files in the so-called “Epstein Library” on the US Department of Justice portal.
Throughout the more than two hundred files, references to Macau are divided between innocuous invitations to open art exhibitions resulting from artistic residencies in the Macao SAR, “briefings” with economic news and about Sheldon Adelson's business in Macau, sent by dubious characters to say the least, reports on the business environment and gambling revenues and trips to the territory. HM analyzed the files released so far, diving between purely financial information and sordid allusions.
One of the most interesting conversations, dated January 1, 2019, features Jeffrey Epstein himself and political operative and podcaster Steve Bannon. Among political contiguities, Epstein states that the American Democratic Party would be using a law that requires registration as a foreign agent to attack Steve Wynn. A tactic described as “potent”. And then he says that “Donald doesn't respect him at all, nothing at all”, referring to the founder of Wynn Resorts.
After Bannon's agreement, Epstein continues to state: “the same in relation to Adelson”, adding the fragile position of those who have “interests in Macau”. "Way worse than fragile, buried in shit. They already threw your contact from a 40-story building," adds Bannon.
The MAGA movement operative and strategist in Trump's first term as President of the United States does not specify who was “thrown” from the building, but the conversation between Bannon and Epstein took place just over two months after the alleged suicide of Zheng Xiaosong, director of the Central Government Liaison Office in Macau. Zheng died after falling from Block 2 of the Hung On Center, on Rua de Luís Gonzaga Gomes. Beijing issued a short statement stating that he was suffering from depression, suggesting that it was a case of suicide.
Remember that at this time Jeffrey Epstein had already been convicted of crimes of a sexual nature and Steve Bannon was “helping” the tycoon to rehabilitate his public image, in the midst of the campaign for the elections won by Joe Biden.
Macau, an inspiration
Still in the conversation between Steve Bannon and Epstein, it is indicated that Steve Wynn has a “huge problem with Kwok”, who Epstein refers to as “your boy”. According to the Justice Department's investigation into Steve Wynn, in 2022 during the Biden Administration, Bannon's “boy” will be Miles Kwok, or Guo Wengui, a Chinese dissident businessman exiled in the United States.
The founder of Wynn Resorts reportedly tried to influence the White House in 2017, during Donald Trump's first term, to repatriate Miles Kwok to face corruption charges in China.
Despite Trump's alleged disrespect towards Wynn and Adelson, the two gambling businessmen contributed many millions of dollars to the campaigns of the current President of the United States.
From a much lighter perspective, on a scale of weak morality, in April 2014, Jeffrey Epstein receives an email from his long-time assistant Lesleu Groff with an invitation to the opening of the exhibition “Classic Artwork from Macau”, at the New York Academic of Art. The exhibition was the result of an invitation from the Macao SAR Government, through the Directorate of Tourism Services, to 10 artists based in the United States. The idea would be to take advantage of an artistic residency in the territory to capture the beauty of Macau. Of the 10 artists chosen, three were students at the New York Academic of Art, an institution that had Epstein in its administration.
Despite the lighter perspective of this detail in the files, it is important to note that Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, recruited victims among the academy's students. In the published files it is not indicated whether Epstein visited the art exhibition inspired by Macau.
Rot and finances
The vast majority of mentions of Macau in documents released by the Department of Justice concern opinion pieces and financial news about the business environment in Macau, gambling revenue from local dealerships, and articles about Sheldon Adelson's connections to the Republican Party. Most of the emails containing this type of information were sent by an assistant to the deceased sexual predator, but also by other characters.
In addition to receiving reports from Deutsche Bank Securities, including on the development of infrastructure in the region (such as the Delta Bridge, Zhuhai's connection to the high-speed rail line and the Light Rail) and its expected impact on Macau's economy, Epstein received articles sent by Terje Rød-Larsen and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem with information about the Macao SAR.
The first is a Norwegian politician and diplomat, who since leaving public office has dedicated himself to uniting the North American MAGA movement and European far-right parties. Rød-Larsen sent a collection of articles, some of them about Sheldon Adelson.
The second is a businessman from the United Arab Emirates, who shared with Epstein sordid details about his sexual adventures with women, but who also sent articles about the Macau casino industry.
Some emails appear with the emissary erased, with an email from September 2012 in which it is stated that “Macau is becoming super interesting”, in a message about the GDP growth of the Comoros Archipelago, on the southeast coast of Africa.
However, in addition to economic and political information, in the files in which Macau is mentioned, messages from Jean-Luc Brunel, a sexual predator who operated as the owner of a modeling agency, and who allegedly committed suicide in prison before being tried, appear. The similarities with Epstein's death go further, with hanging allegedly being the method used by both. In December 2013, Brunel told Epstein that he was leaving for Macau, describing the city as “rat hunting territory”. When he arrives, the Frenchman says that “Macau is more horrible than horrible”. However, two days later, Brunel says “Las Vegas looks like a small, chic city”, without punctuation. There are no further details in the files about Jean-Luc Brunel's time in Macau.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Seat belts (I)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/cintos-de-seguranca-i/</link><description>Hong Kong implemented the “Road Traffic (Safety Equipment Regulation 2025) Amendment” on January 25, which requires all bus passengers to wear seat belts. Violators can face fines of up to HK$55,000 and be sentenced to imprisonment for up to three months.
On January 30, just six days after the law came into force, the Hong Kong Government announced its suspension. The amendment will be rewritten before being submitted to the Legislative Council for review.
Why was the law suddenly suspended six days after it came into force? The suspension was due to the occurrence of three incidents that gave rise to some reflection on the matter.
The first involved a passenger who was unable to unfasten his seat belt and was trapped for around 16 minutes. Twenty firefighters from the Fire Department were sent to help. After carrying out an inspection, Citybus Co. Ltd. discovered that aluminum foil had been placed inside the belt buckle, a suspected act of vandalism, and reported the incident to the police. This case demonstrated the potential risk of mandatory seat belt use during emergency evacuations and raised questions about whether passengers could cut their seat belts to escape in dangerous situations.
When reviewing or analyzing a law, it is crucial that there is “clear discernment and careful consideration.” If a passenger needs to escape following an accident and is unable to unfasten their seat belt, do they have the right to cut it to escape? In other words, could the law give people the right to damage other people's property in order to escape? Under Hong Kong law, damaging other people's property is a criminal offence. To convict a suspect, the prosecution will have to prove that the defendant intended to damage someone else's property and demonstrate his actions. If the purpose is to escape during an emergency, even if the belt breaks, there is no malicious intent to damage other people's property, and the person cannot be convicted under criminal law.
However, the situation is different with regard to civil law. Civil law establishes lower requirements than criminal law for the concept of “intent,” and in certain circumstances, it may accept the act of damaging another’s property to escape danger as an act to “Avoid an emergency.”
Because the law does not explicitly indicate whether passengers can cut their seat belts in these cases, the question arises as to whether passengers have the right to do so to escape and whether they must subsequently compensate the transport company for losses. Furthermore, if the passenger does not compensate the carrier, is the insurance company responsible? Currently, the law does not regulate this issue; To avoid controversy, perhaps future revisions to the law could do so. Without a clear answer in the future, any legislation from the Hong Kong Government will likely be subject to scrutiny.
The second incident occurred on January 27th. A passenger in a wheelchair, surnamed Zheng, caught the bus at the Tin Ma Court stop in Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon. Due to mobility problems, he asked the driver for help to fasten his seat belt. During this process, Zheng expressed concern about the way the belt held him, and asked the driver for explanations, which caused a delay in departure. Another passenger named Li, who was in a hurry to get to work, argued with Zheng. When Zheng picked up his cell phone to film the altercation, Li suddenly snatched the device from his hands and repeatedly hit him in the head with the phone.
It is believed that this was the first case to involve a person with special needs in a discussion regarding the use of seat belts on a bus and served to draw important lessons. It demonstrates that it is necessary to take special care with people who have special needs when putting on a seat belt. To solve the problem, the driver must first provide help and other passengers will have to be patient. Keeping quiet on public transport can avoid unnecessary conflicts. Ultimately, assisting people with special needs with seat belts and ensuring their safety during travel is an act of care and compassion, similar to providing priority seats.
Perhaps the Hong Kong Government could consider including a clause in the legislation to prevent malicious interference from third parties when the driver is helping a passenger to buckle up. This regulation would ensure that people with special needs can access public services, which is certainly consensual. Only by ensuring that those in need receive quick assistance and when possible the bus continues its journey can the problem be resolved. This regulation would benefit everyone.
In addition to reviewing the law, transport companies could provide training to drivers related to the mandatory use of seat belts, to learn how to better deal with these situations. They could also place information inside the buses about the provisions made in relation to the transport of people with special needs, ensuring that all passengers were aware. This would also benefit the image of carriers by providing higher quality services, as well as Hong Kong residents and society as a whole.
Next week we celebrate Chinese New Year. I wish all my readers a Happy New Year, good health and continued success for Hoje Macau newspaper. We will meet again on February 24th and at that time we will continue our discussion about the use of seat belts on buses.

We went to Portalegre to help some friends who were desperate about the destruction of their homes, like thousands of Portuguese people from North to South. Kristin, Leonardo and last Saturday in Marta, storms that have already caused 15 deaths. Three storms with lots of rain and wind that left Portugal in a state of calamity. Looking closely, it was a rainstorm similar to the many that happen in England and that does not leave thousands of people in despair and without everything they have managed to accumulate throughout a lifetime of work. One difference is that in Portugal government authorities never knew what planning is.
Plan what to do in case of a catastrophe, in case of floods, in case of earthquake, in case of a plane crash in Lisbon, in case of purchasing and storing a batch of generators if there is an energy blackout. Planning is a word unknown to those who govern. They worry about day to day life and the announcement of an airport in Alcochete, which should be operational there by the year 2045 and with a TGV from Lisbon to Badajoz.
In this last case of the TGV, it would be better if the Government had decided on a TGV between Beja and Lisbon and Beja airport was already operating as Lisbon's international airport. But let's go back to Portalegre and where several Alentejo residents told us, as an act of revolt and despair, similar to Leiria, Marinha Grande, Alcácer do Sal, Ourém, Coimbra or Régua, that “I won't vote even if they arrest me”. In fact, the second round of the presidential elections took place yesterday in most of the national territory, although some municipalities decided to postpone them due to a lack of minimum conditions to open polling stations.
The calamity that struck Portugal, some say is unprecedented, has been something horrible. Isolated villages, agricultural fields that disappeared, houses that flew away, hundreds of roofs that disappeared, factories where everything was destroyed and workers were unemployed for many months, thousands of fallen trees, hundreds of cars destroyed, floods of water that invaded houses, hotels and restaurants – some up to the ceiling, displaced homes, exhausted firefighters, a lady cooking in a cubicle for 300 families in a housing unit, marine boats non-stop transporting people who already had a house flooded, animals that were left without stables or kennels, food that did not reach certain populations.
There are still thousands of Portuguese people without energy, water and telecommunications. A tragedy that struck a people who never imagined such a catastrophe was possible. However, one very important aspect must be highlighted: solidarity. We remember, for example, the attitude of the people of Trás-os-Montes, particularly in Mirandela, where the Parish Councils got together and acquired tons of tiles that were taken to Marinha Grande in a 16-wheel truck facilitated by the owner. The solidarity between one another has been endless and has been a great display of humanism in the faces of those in government who simply visit the misfortunes experienced by the populations and who tomorrow are already planning their summer holidays in the Algarve or Punta Cana.
The first storm Kristin was recorded almost two weeks ago, but state support for those left with nothing may only arrive this week. Insurance companies are starting to “skate” when it comes to putting things in black and white regarding the payment of the losses that each citizen suffered due to the bad weather. Insurance companies should be subject to large fines when they do not comply with stipulations in favor of those affected. They only think about the annual profit…
And now? Experts ask about the future, if new Leonardos or Martas continue to appear? The Government must give a quick answer about the future and what it plans to reform so that something changes with positive decisions. And starting with the ‘Civil Protection’ institution, which does not have the humility to admit that its system is full of insufficiencies.
It was two weeks of horror, panic, suffering and loss. There were women and men who went more than four days without sleeping an hour. Looking around and just seeing water rising and destroying the refrigerator, the washing machine, the stove, the carpets and all the material values ​​that decorate a house was something very sad. Televisions showed the tears of men and women who were left with absolutely nothing. The country cannot continue like this, because the country is not poor, what exists are too many thieves.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 03:51:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Predominance of executive power</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/predominancia-do-poder-executivo/</link><description>In early 2026, Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, spoke at a seminar on the topic of “persisting and improving the predominance of executive power to boost the good governance of Special Administrative Regions”. The audience included the Chief Executives of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as members of the plenary sessions from both regions.
According to the “Basic Laws” of both regions, the Chief Executive is responsible to the Central People's Government and his Special Administrative Region. In his speech, Xia Baolong highlighted that "the Chief Executive plays a crucial role and assumes significant responsibilities. He must effectively exercise the powers conferred by law, fully assume the responsibility of leading the Special Administrative Region and manage his 'house' well... striving to build an efficient and competent government." The higher the position, the greater the responsibility.
The Chief Executive must assume full responsibility for the Special Administrative Region and needs to form an efficient and well-prepared Government; the responsibility is significant and the task is arduous. How to make the most of the advantages of the predominance of executive power will undoubtedly be the biggest test for the Chief Executives of both regions.
The Government exists to “serve the people”, and people's degree of satisfaction and happiness is the criterion that assesses whether performance matches aspirations. If members of the Government (civil servants) cannot obtain the approval of the people, replacing them is a reasonable option. Many members of the Central Government were dismissed or detained for corruption and neglect of duty, demonstrating that no one is above the law. Since the return of Hong Kong and Macau to Chinese sovereignty, both regions have developed and progressed, but there are also limitations. Good governance is not based on empty speeches. What is clearly expressed in Xia's speech is the hope for improving and strengthening governance capacity.
Let us remember the terrible fire in Tai Po, Hong Kong, which occurred at the end of last year, which is still being investigated by an independent committee. We do not know how many members of the Government will be held responsible for the incident. Furthermore, the recent measure that requires passengers to wear seat belts on public transport went through a lot of setbacks before it was implemented. For example, how can a pregnant woman be forced to wear a seat belt at the end of her term? How to deal with elderly people who prefer to stand up so they don't wear a seat belt?
In Macau, with the promulgation and implementation of Law No. 5/2025 “Law on the Activity of Travel Agencies and the Tourist Guide Profession”, travel agencies are not authorized to provide shuttle bus services to inhabitants of large residential neighborhoods, which makes travel problematic, especially for domestic workers and children.
With more than 40 million tourists expected to visit Macau in 2025, the capacity of public transport has been systematically tested. Although the city government has not implemented regulations against overcrowding of these vehicles, passengers continue to board buses at designated exit-only stops. The patience and tolerance of Macau residents are extraordinary, but faced with the popularity of online shopping and in mainland China, stores are emptying across the city. Even after they are renovated, when they open again, the owners are not sure how long their businesses will last. The “2026 Consumer Carnival in the North Zone” initiative demonstrates that the Macau SAR Government still needs to work to achieve good governance.
Last year, when Chief Executive Sam Hou Fai invited representatives of the Portuguese and English-speaking media to the annual meal, he highly praised their professionalism, concern for social well-being and supervision of the Government's performance. At the same meeting in 2026, Chief Executive Sam Hou Fai expressed the hope that they would continue to pay attention and support the performance of the Macao SAR Government in its various aspects, reflect the living conditions of the population and offer their valid suggestions.
In the context of the predominance of executive power in 2026, the media should not be limited to being an instrument of propaganda or a platform for praise, but rather play the role of advisor, supervisor and partner to help the Macao SAR Government achieve good governance.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 02:08:07</pubDate></item><item><title>The Little Ice Age and its social implications</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/a-pequena-idade-do-gelo-e-as-suas-implicacoes-sociais/</link><description>Concern about the sustainability of our planet is not new. According to Professor José Pinto Peixoto1 (1922-1996), in his book “Influence of Man on Climate and Environment”2, mentioning an extract from the Book of Isaiah3, “The Earth is desolate and withered; Heaven and Earth are fading. The Earth is desecrated by its inhabitants, because they transgress the law and violate the right…”.
In reality, the harmful action that the species Homo sapiens exerts on nature has intensified since around 10,000 years ago, when the agricultural revolution underwent a great increase, when man largely abandoned his activities as hunter-gatherers. With this quote, Professor JPP intended to illustrate that in ancient times there were people who were concerned about what man could do to our planet. By definition, a prophet is someone who serves as an intermediary between the divine and the people, and this text can be interpreted as a warning about the intensification of aggressions that our species would practice, and which led to the current ecological and climate crisis.
Life on our planet is only possible due to a series of circumstances, including the Earth being at a distance from the Sun suitable for the existence of liquid water, a breathable atmosphere and a magnetic field that serves as a protector against electrically charged particles emitted by the Sun (solar wind), which prevents the surface from being reached by part of the radiation that is harmful to life.
Since the Earth's atmosphere was formed, its characteristics have always evolved, in terms of composition and meteorological and climatic parameters. Climate change has greatly influenced human history, shaping the behavior of Homo sapiens.
They have been one of the main causes of great migrations and, consequently, the emergence of different civilizations. Research in the area of ​​paleoclimatology allows us to conclude that, for millions of years, the climate was characterized by glacial and interglacial periods. During the most recent glaciation, ice invaded large areas of Europe and Asia, causing populations to migrate to lower latitudes. Around 6,000 years ago, the prolonged drought that caused the desertification of the region where the Sahara is located, caused people to flee to the Nile River valley, where a civilization flourished whose testimonies are still a source of admiration and study today.
In the last million years there have been approximately six glacial periods. Although we are currently in an interglacial period, there have been shorter periods characterized by relatively low temperatures, such as what is known as the “little ice age”, between the 14th and 19th centuries. There is no unanimity about the beginning, and some historians consider that it began later, in the 16th century. There is, however, consensus that this period was characterized by harsh winters and short summers. The cause of this cooling is still debated today, which could have been a consequence of several natural factors, such as the decrease in solar activity and the increase in the concentration of particles in the atmosphere resulting from volcanic activity and the consequent reduction in radiation reaching the surface.
According to some historians, the “little ice age” may have been one of the causes of social upheavals.
Thus, in the United States of America, in 1692, a social phenomenon occurred that consisted of collective hysteria on the part of the population of Salem, a town in the State of Massachusetts, which resulted in a series of trials, mostly involving women accused of witchcraft. A succession of years with poor agricultural results and consequent food shortages contributed to the perception of insecurity among the populations of the New England region. Faced with this situation, the collective psychological climate contributed to hundreds of women being treated as scapegoats, some of whom were executed by hanging. This subject has been studied by several historians and served as the subject of plays, literary works and films. The most emblematic work was the play by Arthur Miller (“The Crucible” – 1953), in which the author explored this social phenomenon as a metaphor for McCarthyism, a period in US history between the late 1940s and mid-1950s, characterized by the persecution of alleged communists, inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy. The author himself was a victim of this persecution. There were several literary works on the same subject, perhaps the most striking being the non-fiction work “The Witches: Salem, 1692” by American writer Stacy Schiff. Arthur Miller's play was adapted by Arthur Miller for the cinema in 1996, and the film was distributed in Portugal with the title “The Witches of Salem”.
It was also during the Little Ice Age that great social instability occurred that preceded the start of the French Revolution. Popular dissatisfaction caused by widespread hunger due to successive natural disasters, such as a severe drought in 1788 interrupted by intense hail and hailstorms that caused the loss of a large part of the crops that had resisted. To make matters worse, the winter of 1788/1789 was extremely harsh.
The melting of thick layers of snow and ice caused floods and floods the following spring, in much of France, causing serious destruction of infrastructure and almost all of the few crops that remained. Following these meteorological disasters, an outbreak of plague emerged that wiped out many of the animals that had been saved. Hunger resulted from these events and chaos ensued in large urban centers. The summer of 1789 was extremely dry, which contributed to the worsening of the situation. This entire sequence of events, together with the ineffectiveness of Louis XVI's government, contributed to social unrest, which may have constituted a kind of trigger to trigger the French revolution, one of the most notable episodes of which was the Storming of the Bastille, on July 14, 1789.
It can be concluded that meteorological phenomena that, as a whole, characterize the climate of a region, contribute greatly to the worsening of social crises. For example, the recent storm that hit Portugal on January 27, 2026 (the Kristin depression, resulting from explosive cyclogenesis) generated, on the part of the affected population, a feeling of unease in relation to political power. Another example was the drought that reached its peak in 2017, which caused serious damage to agriculture, livestock, water resources and a strong environmental impact in terms of forest fires that caused dozens of fatalities.
In both cases, the political power was accused, by the affected population, of not having taken the necessary measures to minimize the serious consequences that resulted from these natural disasters. Regardless of governments, natural disasters generally cause, rightly or wrongly, the feeling, on the part of the population, that their consequences could be minimized if more efficient preventive measures had been taken, such as, for example, improving forest management, strengthening infrastructure and more rigorous early weather warnings.

The session starts at 11:30 am and is part of the third International Congress on Colonial and Post-Colonial Landscapes, Architecture, Cities and Work, with a presentation by the authors themselves.
“Layering The City” is an investigation into infrastructures and public spaces in Macau, revealing the perspectives that Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni put into each project they undertake, with a focus on projects such as social housing in the Fai Chi Kei neighborhood, the Barra station and the Intermodal zone, related to the Light Rail.
As explained by Rui Leão in an interview with HM, the book is composed “of texts by some critics about our work”, namely Jorge Figueira, and an interview conducted by academic Ana Vaz Milheiro, also author of the preface.
In this book, there is the idea of ​​construction in layers, revealing the different perspectives of the two architects in each project they carry out. "There is work brought by each person to the project, which involves responding to the programmed request, what the client asks for, what lives in the alignment plan [of the project], or a series of issues at a civic level, public space or the right to quality of life. There are a series of social dimensions [to take into account to] make spaces for people, even when they are impossible [in terms] of politics and in the city. It is these layers that enter the projects and that, deep down, pass for creating opportunities to improve the life of the city, the person, the street”, said Rui Leão in the same interview.
Portuguese houses
Meanwhile, architect Rui Leão also participates, as co-curator, in the exhibition “Habitar Portugal 1974-2924″, opened this Wednesday, starting at 7pm, at the Architecture Center – Garagem Sul, at the Centro Cultural de Belém, in Lisbon.
This is an initiative that marks 50 years of Democracy through a selection of one hundred works of Portuguese Architecture, built in Portugal and around the world between 1974 and 2024”, with the team of curators Alexandra Saraiva and Célia Gomes.
According to the official description of the exhibition, available on the CCB website, what is sought is to look at architecture “as a political gesture; to highlight positions of rupture; to enhance the persistence of memories”. You can see projects such as the Hotel Dom Henrique, in Porto, designed by José Carlos Loureiro, or the Complexo das Amoreiras, by Tomás Taveira. Highlights include works such as the Côa Museum, by Camilo Rebelo and Tiago Pimentel, or the requalification project of Casa do Passal – Museu Aristides de Sousa Mendes, by the studio Rosmaninho + Azevedo.
This is the seventh edition of the “Habitar Portugal” exhibition, with one hundred works having been chosen “with different programs and different scales, guided by national and international representation (including the Portuguese expression built outside the country)”.
According to the same note, “this is a significant and valuable record that not only offers a panoramic look at the last quarter of the 20th century and the first of the 21st century, but also seeks to project the future of contemporary Portuguese architecture, and consequently the social, economic and territorial development of Portugal in the world”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:25:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Concert | South Korean group Treasure in Macau next month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/concerto-grupo-sul-coreano-treasure-em-macau-no-proximo-mes/</link><description>The Venetian Arena is preparing to host, on March 6th, another K-Pop concert, this time by the boy band Treasure. The group from South Korea, made up of ten members, was created in 2019 and was born in the context of a television program made to discover musical talents
The band Treasure, from South Korea, has only been alive for a few years, but their success seems to be guaranteed. Proof of this is the group's show that Macau will host on March 6th at the Venetian Arena, in Cotai, from 8pm, as part of the “Treasure Tour [Pulse On] in Macao”.
Treasure are a boy band formed in 2019 through the YG Treasure Box talent hunt program, which aimed to train this group of young singers. Of the more than 20 candidates, who had to pass several challenging tests to demonstrate their talent, the ten best voices were chosen. Currently, the group consists of Choi Hyun-suk, Jihoon, Yoshi, Junkyu, Yoon Jae-hyuk, Asahi, Doyoung, Haruto, Park Jeong-woo and So Jung-hwan.
The recipe of combining the creation of a group of singing boys with a television program seems to have worked, and the truth is that success was felt as soon as they started composing songs and publishing them on the market.
In August 2020, “BOY”, the first single, was released, and “The First Step: Chapter One” was also released that year. This record work was part of a trilogy of albums that, as a whole, sold more than a million copies in just five months.
According to the description of the show in Macau, available on the Venetian Arena website, it is said that the concert reveals how Treasure are “expanding their global influence”, as the first tour, just in Japan in 2023, included eight cities and 26 shows.
At that time, the tour attracted “almost 300,000 spectators and set the record for the highest audience for a debut tour by a Korean artist”.
The first tour in Asia followed, this time with 17 cities included and a total of 40 concerts. In 2024, Japan once again hosted a Treasure tour, which included two meetings with fans, while last year the “Treasure Fan Concert [Special Moment] took place. These moments were also revealing of the group's success, as together they “surpassed an accumulated audience of one million [people], demonstrating their status and the band's power in live performances”.
On the road since 2025
Treasure come to Macau with new songs under their belt. The third mini-album, titled “Love Pulse”, was released on September 1st, and in March it was time for the record market to receive “Pleasure”, a “special mini-album”.
The concert at the Venetian Arena is part of the group's tour that has marked Treasure's schedule since the second half of 2025. In October, the group gave three consecutive concerts in Seoul, and then performed again in Japan.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:24:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Archive in Lisbon helps Brazilians confirm land ownership</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/09/arquivo-em-lisboa-ajuda-brasileiros-a-confirmar-posse-de-terras/</link><description>The Overseas Historical Archive (AHU) of Portugal is still consulted today by Brazilians looking for proof that they are the owners of their lands in Brazil, distributed by the Portuguese five centuries ago, indicates the person responsible for this institution.
“From time to time, we receive requests to hand over an authenticated document to a court, or to settle a dispute or conflict at that level, despite it being historical documentation,” Ana Canas, a researcher at the History Center of the University of Lisbon who has served as director of the AHU, told the Lusa agency.
This documentation, physically present in the AHU, but already available on digital media, includes documents from the granting of sesmarias in Brazil, a land distribution system adopted by the Portuguese Crown, in the 16th century, in which land was donated to sesmeiros, so that they could occupy and produce on them.
And it is this proof of land concession that its owners still seek at the AHU today, as it is there that the documentation resulting from the relationship between Brazil and the Portuguese administration resides, during the colonial period.
Kilometers of papers
The AHU, created in 1931 with the aim of safeguarding the repositories of the Portuguese colonial administration, stores around 17 kilometers of documentation, which portrays the relationship between the various territories (former Portuguese colonies) and the organizations based in Lisbon.
Documents that have proven to be sources of information about these territories and their experiences: India, Brazil, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, Timor-Leste and Macau.
The Brazilian collection, located at the AHU facilities, which is located in the Palácio do Ega, in Lisbon, was the subject of the “Projecto Resgate Barão do Rio Branco”, an international archival cooperation program, whose mission is to catalog and reproduce the handwritten historical documentation relating to this country, until independence, in 1822.
The Portuguese arrived in Brazil in 1500 and the occupation of the lands began in 1530. It is the history of this presence and the relationship with the Crown, in Portugal, until independence, that the documentation tells. For more than 10 years, around 120 researchers involved in this project worked on the 300,000 documents that are located at the AHU and that involve Brazil, which are now duly identified and distributed in more than 2,000 boxes, in addition to being available on digital media.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 03:25:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Concert | OneRepublic perform in Hong Kong this month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/09/concerto-onerepublic-actuam-em-hong-kong-este-mes/</link><description>The North American band OneRepublic is returning to Asia for a series of concerts, highlighting their trip to the AsiaWorld-Expo stage on the 17th for the “OneRepublic – From Asia, With Love in Hong Kong” tour. Performances will follow in China, Korea and Japan
Asian fans of North Americans OneRepublic will soon have the opportunity to see them up close again. After a visit to Macau in 2024, the group will return to Asia, but this time to neighboring Hong Kong, to perform as part of the “OneRepublic – From Asia, With Love in Hong Kong” tour. This show is scheduled for the 17th of this month at AsiaWorld-Expo.
Organized by LiveNation, the concert takes place from 8pm and promises to bring the greatest hits from the band that has already been nominated for a Grammy, namely “Counting Stars”, “Apologize”, “I Ain’t Worried” and “Run”.
The synopsis of the show, published on the AsiaWorld-Expo portal, states that the band “continues to captivate millions of fans around the world with their characteristic sound and sincere narratives”, and, during their visit to Hong Kong, fans can expect “an electrifying night of music, energy and connection”, in a collective celebration of “the group's greatest hits and new works”.
The “From Asia, With Love” tour aims to be “a special celebration of OneRepublic’s strong connection with its Asian fans, highlighting the region as one of the band’s most passionate audiences”, with Hong Kong “being one of the main stops on this exclusive tour”.

In March, it is OneRepublic's turn to travel to another show taking place in Singapore, on the 2nd; followed by Taipei, Taiwan, on March 4th. Concerts in China follow on April 17th, 19th and 25th in the cities of Shenzhen, Wuhan and Shanghai, respectively.
OneRepublic continues to tour the rest of the world, particularly with concerts in Mexico and Europe, in countries such as Italy, Luxembourg, Spain and Scotland.
Successes since 2000
OneRepublic emerged in 2002 in Colorado Springs presenting themselves as a group of pop rock and alternative rock songs, starting to be successful on the social network MySpace, which has since disappeared. In 2006, the band managed to sign a contract with the record label Mosley Music Group, releasing their debut album, “Dreaming Out Loud”.
At that time they achieved international success, thanks to the single “Apologize”, which featured the contribution of rapper and producer Timbaland; and also the single “Stop and Stare”. This album sold more than three million copies worldwide.
After several years of recording and being on the road, OneRepublic participated, in 2022, on the soundtrack of the film that revived the cinema classic “Top Gun”, starring Tom Cruise. On the album that contains all the songs from “Top Gun: Maverick” the band participates with “I Ain’t Worried”, alongside names like Lady Gaga or Lorne Balfe. After the release of “Artificial Paradise” in 2024, the group returned to new songs in December last year with the single “Give Me Something”, made for the game “Arknights Endfield”. This song was produced by band members Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle and Simon Oscroft.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 03:19:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Concerts | Ticket scam embezzles five women</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/concertos-burla-com-bilhetes-desfalca-cinco-mulheres/</link><description>Five women from the interior of China were allegedly defrauded of more than 18 thousand patacas in a scheme related to concert tickets. According to the Chinese Radio Macau channel, the fraud scheme was similar to all the victims and began with a comment from the alleged fraudster in social media posts made by women who wanted to go to concerts and had difficulty acquiring tickets.
One of the victims lost a total of 10,438 patacas, having started by transferring 6,000 patacas as payment for two tickets that the fraudster had arranged. Afterwards, the suspect said that the tickets were already sold out, promising a refund that never happened. The scammer also sent QR codes for victims to contact a fake employee from a financial department who would help with reimbursement, leading victims to transfer more money.
In this woman's case, another three thousand patacas were transferred, with the suspect claiming that the operation had not been successful, demanding more payments. Only then did the woman realize that she could be a victim of fraud and complained to the police. The Judicial Police (PJ) says it received complaints regarding five cases of fraud between the 6th and 8th of February, all of which are being investigated. There have been no arrests yet.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:09:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Research | Businessman Ng Lap Seng in the Epstein files</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/investigacao-empresario-ng-lap-seng-nos-ficheiros-epstein/</link><description>Local businessman Ng Lap Seng, convicted in the Public Works case, appears in five Epstein files due to the trial in New York in which he was sentenced to three years in prison. References appear in newsletters analyzing investigation trends into “white collar” crimes and in email exchanges between FBI departments
Macau businessman Ng Lap Seng, who was released from Coloane prison last year after serving two and a half years in the Public Works case, also appears in the Epstein files, analyzed by HM. It is recalled that Ng Lap Seng was sentenced in 2018 in the United States to three years in prison for bribing the president of the United Nations General Assembly, John Ashe, to guarantee support for the construction of an international organization's conference center in Macau.
In an email sent by a firm of legal analysts, with the receiver crossed out, in which a compilation of news and analyzes of cases of financial corruption is made, there is news about the Ng Lap Seng case and how an accomplice of the businessman, in charge of delivering the bribe, escaped a prison sentence for having collaborated with justice.
The other reference to Ng Lap Seng appears in an email sent by the Department of Justice itself, about a week before Jeffrey Epstein's death, with a newsletter on investigation trends in international corruption cases.
The Macau businessman is mentioned in an article where he says he paid a security firm, made up in part of former FBI agents, to take care of his security in an apartment in New York (mid-town), while he awaited the start of the trial.
The other three documents in which Ng Lap Seng's name appears are email exchanges between FBI departments, dated between the end of May and the beginning of June 2019, about two months before Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in a cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. The subject of the emails indicated is the management of documents discovered in the investigation.
At the end of the emails, the cases handled by the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Southern District of New York, in collaboration with the FBI, are listed, including the case of Ng Lap Seng.
Life is a party
Another lurid detail where references to Macau appear in the “Epstein Library”, as the US Department of Justice calls it”, is in the case that Hanna Bouveng filed against the owner of the New York Global Group, tycoon Benjamin Wey, in a process that culminated in 2015 with compensation of 18 million dollars, which would later be reduced to 5.6 million dollars.
The Tianjin-born businessman was accused of defamation in one of the many legal cases he faced. Benjamin Wey's judicial “career” includes accusations of eight crimes of conspiracy, financial and electronic fraud and money laundering, on suspicion of using offshore accounts to hide transactions between Chinese companies and American shell companies. The case would eventually collapse due to illegally obtaining evidence.
The reasons why the Epstein files contain documents from the court case between Hanna Bouveng and Benjamin Wey are unclear, something that recurs in the documentary “library”, where a lack of context is the norm.
However, the case alleges that two defendants, including Wey, published an article in a magazine with the title: “Do you want to attract Swedish women?”. Hanna Bouveng, of Swedish nationality, is characterized in the article as “a girl who likes to party and who has just arrived at the clubs of New York after a year of providing ‘entertainment’ in clubs in Hong Kong and casinos in Macau”, alluding to prostitution activities.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:08:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Requests concrete measures to promote NAPE</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/economia-pedidas-medidas-concretas-para-promover-nape/</link><description>With small and medium-sized companies dealing with the reality of the closure of satellite casinos, the deputy linked to the Jiangme community, Lee Koi Ian, asks the Executive for a plan with concrete measures to promote the economy in NAPE
With NAPE facing the end of satellite casinos and their impact on the local economy, MP Lee Koi Ian is calling on the Government to come up with measures to deal with the new problems. The position was taken through a written interpellation, published on the Legislative Assembly portal.
“As the satellite casinos gradually ceased operations in NAPE, the surrounding commercial districts face a sharp decline in the number of visitors, plunging the entire area into a difficult situation, characterized by imbalance between sectors and the loss of customers”, begins by outlining the scenario, the deputy supported by the Jiangmen community.
Lee Koi Ian also recognizes that the Government Action Lines for this year promise to promote “a series of carnival-style events” at NAPE, with experiences that are expected to attract greater “cultural and tourist consumption” in order to “revitalize the image of the community and increase the vitality of the commercial area”.
However, the legislator is now asking the Executive for more concrete plans. "Given the value of the location and the commercial base of NAPE's surrounding districts, it is crucial to establish a long-term revitalization mechanism. This is the central approach to avoid dependence on short-term policies, break the impasse of homogenized competition and cultivate a sustainable commercial ecosystem," he said. “Does the Government have a specialized plan to revitalize the commercial areas around NAPE?”, he asks.
Profound changes
Lee Koi Ian also warns of the difficulties of not only attracting tourists to that area of ​​the city, but making them want to stay and consume there, taking into account the existence of other more attractive places.
“The transition of commercial zones from a transit destination to a consumption destination is not only central to sustainable development. It is also a crucial measure to create a local commercial ecosystem”, argues Lee Koi Ian. “In this context, what specific measures will the Government introduce in ZAPE commercial areas, to help small and medium-sized companies to modernize, while cultivating different business formats?”, he asks.
The deputy also calls for optimizing NAPE's infrastructure, expanding pedestrian facilities and organizing “various events to increase the circulation of people and stimulate the vitality of local consumption”. The request is made despite the measures being seen only as palliative care to facilitate the transition.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:07:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism | Associations want activities in neighborhoods to attract visitors</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/turismo-associacoes-querem-actividades-nos-bairros-para-atrair-visitantes/</link><description>The president of the Macau Tourist Industry Association, Andy Wu, thinks that the Government can improve plans to attract tourists to residential neighborhoods, which are on the margins in terms of commerce for the many visitors who arrive in Macau.
Speaking to the newspaper Ou Mun, the businessman also argued that although last year the Government launched several activities in residential neighborhoods, the short duration of the initiatives did not allow them to create lasting impressions among tourists. Without asking for a daily schedule in these areas of the city, Andy Wu would like to see regular activities every weekend, in order to put places that are not normally visited “on the map” for tourists. Furthermore, the person responsible understands that transport to community neighborhoods must be improved to facilitate access for tourists.
With the Chinese New Year holidays next week, travel agency entrepreneur Paul Wong also indicated that the Government should continue to close areas of the city to traffic to divert visitors from the most popular tourist attractions.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:03:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Pearl Horizon | Only 338 residents purchased replacement units</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/09/pearl-horizon-so-338-residentes-compraram-fraccoes-de-substituicao/</link><description>Only 338 residents of the 1,923 affected by the non-construction of Pearl Horizon went ahead to purchase replacement apartments, made available by Macau Renovação Urbana.

The deadline for the purchase ended at the end of January, according to the order from the Chief Executive published in November last year. The number represents 17.6 percent of injured residents.

Leung Chun-ying explained that GX, based in Hong Kong, has provided financial support to allow medical students from the Timor Lorosa’e National University to travel to one of the two Chinese regions.
In an interview with Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK, the former leader of the territory's government said that the foundation has expanded its work to ten countries on four continents, offering eight different types of assistance.
Leung said GX has signed agreements with three local higher education institutions: the University of Hong Kong, Chinese University and Polytechnic University. The aim, explained the former HK Chief Executive, is to help students participate in humanitarian work, so that they can learn “benevolence” in Hong Kong and “compassion” abroad.
Leung argued that, faced with major changes in the international panorama, China needs not only to consolidate existing friendships with other countries, but also to make new ones.
In October 2024, the executive director of GX, Emily Chan Ying-yang, told Lusa that the foundation wanted to apply in other countries, starting with Honduras, a project that reversed the rapid growth of dengue fever in Timor-Leste.
Between January and July, GX installed more than 1,670 anti-mosquito lamps and distributed almost 30 thousand adhesive tapes to catch insects, close to 18 thousand rapid dengue detection tests and around 500 anti-mosquito nets, in the 14 Timorese municipalities.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 03:17:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Cooperation | Coimbra and Macau with research program</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/09/cooperacao-coimbra-e-macau-com-programa-de-investigacao/</link><description>The academic collaboration program between universities in the two cities will focus on promoting Sino-Portuguese studies and includes the digitization of historical archives
The University of Coimbra and the Polytechnic University of Macau launched a research program in Digital Humanities, focused on promoting Sino-Portuguese studies, which includes the digitization of historical archives, announced the Chinese institution.
The initiative aims to “further develop Macau's role as a bridge for academic exchange between China and Portuguese-speaking countries and deepen international cooperation in interdisciplinary scientific research”, reads a statement from the Macau Polytechnic University (UPM).
The new program, officially launched this week, will bring together “the advantages of the two universities” to “develop multidimensional research innovations”, focusing on “promoting Sino-Portuguese humanities studies, including the digitization of historical archives, research and development in large-scale Portuguese language models and artificial intelligence, the digital revitalization of cultural heritage, as well as contemporary digital communication”.
Also according to the statement, the vice-rector of the University of Coimbra (UC), Nuno Mendonça, said at the time that, with artificial intelligence profoundly changing research and teaching, “the rise of digital humanities is not only a technical challenge, but also a profound dialogue that involves ethics and culture”.
“With centuries of experience in studying Chinese culture, the UC serves as an academic bridge between East and West, with the aim of integrating linguistic technologies, creative industries and research into cultural heritage through this program”, said Mendonça, quoted in the note.
Academic laboratories
In the future, the two universities will cooperate to create academic laboratories that “will pioneer technological innovation on the campus in Hengqin, a space that symbolizes the fusion between tradition and innovation”, he reinforced.
The two educational institutions signed an agreement “to establish a base of cooperation in the field of higher education in the ‘International Education (University) City of Macau and Hengqin’, in order to build an ‘international campus’ oriented towards the global community”, recalled, in turn, the rector of UPM.
In this sense, said Marcus Im, the new program takes on a significant mission. Focusing on “language and text technologies and digital applications”, and through “building a database of interlingual texts, it promotes data innovation in the human and social sciences”.
On the other hand, through digital exhibitions and interactive experiences, “it encourages the dissemination and sharing of multicultural resources”, stated the rector of UPM, also mentioned in the note. The new campus of the Macau Polytechnic University will be integrated into a university city, which will also include the new campus of the University of Macau, whose work began in December last year.
In the presentation of the Lines of Government Action for 2026, at the end of last year, the local government stated that, in a first phase, the University of Macau, the Polytechnic University of Macau and the University of Tourism of Macau will establish themselves in the location, “expected to begin teaching activities from September 2026, with the number of students set at 1,200, in the first year, and with a predominance of postgraduate.”</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 03:12:38</pubDate></item><item><title>ZELENSKY VS ZELENSKY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.

At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke at length and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. It says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no such thing as chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is usually used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in others. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this mistake. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who didn't love anyone./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria stayed with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely outside our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J. Pinto Fernandes emerges at the exact moment when we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but this only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows everyone else and the joy of recognizing that the yardstick of the world is not measured with my short measure and that, on the contrary, it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican for writers from the north, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thought about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché “all different, all equal”, a return to “diplomacy”, given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that “we are unified because we share the same nature” but simply highlights that we “still do not share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that quenches your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and impressive, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unresponsive to reins and containment.
Let men refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish, because of it the tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the pride of the countries will be destroyed.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert”.
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that muzzle, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relationships were restricted, or if it merely lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Obviously, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as a hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, in a different way, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE

The table where the old people played,
Everything mixed, everything mixed with bodies, with blood,
All one river, one wave, one dragging horror.
Helahoho! helahoho!
I unearthed the child's tin train pressed into the middle of the
[road,
And I cried like all the mothers in the world about the horror of life.
My pantheistic feet tripped over the sewing machine
[widow who was killed with a bayonet
And that poor instrument of peace stuck a spear in my heart.
Yes, I was the one to blame for everything, I was the soldier for them all
Who killed, raped, burned and broke,
It was me and my shame and my remorse like a shadow
[misshapen
They travel around the world like Ashavero,
But behind my steps there are footsteps the size of infinity
And a physical fear of being accountable to God makes me close my eyes.
[eyes suddenly.
(…)
I ordered, captain, to shoot the trembling peasants,
I let the daughters of all fathers tied to trees be raped,
Now I saw that it was inside my heart that all this happened,
And everything scalds and suffocates and I can't move without it
[everything be the same.
God have mercy on me, I didn't have it from anyone!
LÀ-BAS, JE NE SAIS OÙ…”
What is clear today, at this disastrous moment in which Cristiano &amp; Companhia failed in their mission in Braga, and in which the self-sabotage of Russia's gas pipelines reminds us that Putin will be willing to do anything to maintain dominance over the areas endorsed,
is that, bomb for bomb, the “bomb” of the Fifth Empire was preferable.
However, even in this, my dears, we were irresolute, a little more on the side of piela than determined, and we procrastinated.</description><pubDate>2022-09-29 02:34:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran | Leader calls for show of force on the streets against US</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/irao-lider-pede-demonstracao-de-forca-nas-ruas-contra-eua/</link><description>Iran's supreme leader yesterday called on Iranians to use the 47th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution on Wednesday to demonstrate strength against the enemy, in a context of tensions with the United States.
Since 1979, “foreign powers have always sought to reestablish the previous situation”, declared Ali Khamenei, in reference to external influence during the Pahlavi dynasty (1925-1979), an ally of the Americans, which was removed from power by the revolution.
Led by the then 'ayatollah' Ruhollah Khomeini, Shiite fundamentalists established the Islamic Republic following the 1979 revolution, which deposed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last shah of Iran, formally called Persia until 1935.
“The power of a nation lies not so much in its missiles and planes, but in the will and resilience of its people,” said Khamenei, quoted by the France-Presse news agency (AFP).
“Show it again and thwart the enemy’s plans,” said the supreme leader, calling on Iranians to participate in the anniversary of the revolution.
“The presence of the people at the march and the expression of loyalty to the Islamic Republic will make the enemy retreat from its ambition against Iran and national interests,” said Khamenei, also quoted by the Spanish agency EFE.
The country's highest political and religious authority has assured that the demonstration of “national power” through unity will lead to “the discouragement of the enemy”.
Khamenei warned that, as long as the enemy is not discouraged, “he will not stop causing inconvenience” to the Iranians. He also mentioned that on February 11, 1979, the Iranian people achieved a “great victory by freeing the country from foreign intervention”.
Khamenei did not participate on Sunday in the annual meeting with the commanders of the Air Force, the first military body to join the 1979 revolution.
Blood in the streets
The speech comes at one of the Islamic Republic's most fragile moments, after the violent repression of protests against the regime and in the face of the threat of US military intervention if a nuclear agreement is not reached.
The demonstrations, which began on December 28th due to the devaluation of the currency in Tehran, spread throughout the country and were crushed on January 8th and 9th. The Iranian government admitted the deaths of 3,117 people, attributing the violence to the United States and Israel.
The non-governmental organization HRANA, based in North American territory, counted 6,961 deaths, and is still verifying more than 11 thousand possible deaths and 51 thousand arrests.
The UN special rapporteur for Iran, Mai Sato, said that medical reports point to the possibility of up to 20,000 deaths, although the United Nations highlights the difficulty of corroborating the data. Following the crackdown, authorities launched a wave of arrests of moderate political figures and activists.
At the same time, Iran and the United States resumed negotiations for a nuclear agreement last week, in the first meeting after the 12-day war between Tehran and Tel Aviv. The United States participated in the conflict by bombing Iranian nuclear facilities.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:31:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Nuclear | Largest nuclear power plant in the world reactivated</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/nuclear-reactivada-maior-central-nuclear-do-mundo/</link><description>The Japanese electricity company TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) yesterday reactivated the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa (KK) nuclear power plant, the largest in the world in terms of capacity and closed in 2011 after the accident in Fukushima.
“At 14:00, the control bars were removed and reactor number 6 of the nuclear plant was put into operation,” TEPCO said in a statement. The restart of the reactor had been suspended last January after an alarm was raised. The company added that it will continue to check “the integrity of the plant's equipment” and stated that it will respond “sincerely” to inspections by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority.
The company plans to gradually increase the amount of power generated at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa until it resumes commercial operations from March 18.
With a capacity of more than 8,000 megawatts (MW), the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant is a fundamental piece in TEPCO's energy supply plan and is in line with the strategy promoted by the Japanese Government of Sanae Takaichi to boost nuclear plants and meet emissions reduction targets.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:22:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | PM with reinforced power open to dialogue with China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/japao-pm-com-poder-reforcado-aberta-ao-dialogo-com-a-china/</link><description>Sanae Takaichi, who came out with enhanced powers after Sunday's elections, admits to talking to China after the statements about Taiwan that inflamed relations between the two nations
Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, winner of the elections on Sunday, admitted yesterday to dialogue with Beijing, after having raised Chinese anger by admitting a military reaction from Japan if China attacks Taiwan.
"Our country is open to various dialogues with China. We already have exchanges of views. We will continue with these exchanges. But we will do so in a considered and appropriate way", declared Takaichi, quoted by the agency France-Presse (AFP).
The statement was made one day after the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP, as it is known internationally), led by Takaichi, achieved a significant victory in early legislative elections. The result will allow Takaichi to continue with the Government program he has headed since October 2025, including a strong investment in defense.
Takaichi stated in November that the Japanese army could intervene in the event of a Chinese military attack against Taiwan, considering that Japan's security would be at risk. The statement, during a debate in parliament, generated a strong protest from China and both economic and political reprisals, but Takaichi refused to retract.
Chinese diplomacy spokesman Lin Jian said yesterday that Japanese authorities must pursue a pacifist agenda in the region and reaffirmed the demand that the prime minister withdraw the “wrong statements” about Taiwan. Lin also asked Takaichi to demonstrate with “concrete actions” his intention to maintain the political basis of bilateral relations, according to statements cited by the Spanish agency Europa Press (EP).
Absolute majority
The 64-year-old conservative leader won a historic victory on Sunday by winning 316 of the 465 seats that make up the lower house of parliament, according to official data released by NHK television. The first woman to lead Japan thus secured an absolute majority of two thirds, which totals 352 seats when counting the support of the ally Japan Innovation Party (Ishin).
At a press conference in Tokyo, Takaichi yesterday described the electoral victory as a “strong impulse” given by the Japanese people “to carry out political changes regardless of the cost”, according to Spanish news agency EFE.
The prime minister reiterated that the results will allow the coalition to implement “important changes”, including a “proactive and responsible fiscal policy”, as well as a “fundamental strengthening of security policies”. Among the goals announced is the promise to reduce the tax on food and beverages to zero for two years to alleviate the pressure of inflation on families.
He also promised a stimulus package of 21.3 billion yen (around 115 billion euros, at current exchange rates). This stance in favor of increasing public spending raises concerns about the financial health of the most indebted developed power in the world.
Since Takaichi took power in October, the yen has been on a downward trajectory, currently standing at 156 units per dollar on the Tokyo market. The yield on debt obligations reached multi-decade highs, according to EFE.
The American Friend
On the external front, Takaichi also said that he intends to consolidate the “unshakable unity” between Tokyo and Washington, when he visits the United States on March 19, to meet with President Donald Trump.
“Regarding the meeting with President Trump, we will reaffirm the unshakable unity between Japan and the United States and further strengthen cooperation in a wide range of areas, namely diplomacy, economy and security,” he said yesterday. “We will then open a new chapter in the history of the Japanese-American alliance”, he added, quoted by AFP.
Trump, que visitou o Japão em Outubro, anunciou na semana passada que Takaichi visitará Washington em 19 de Março, e descreveu a líder japonesa como “uma dirigente forte, poderosa e sábia, que ama verdadeiramente o seu país”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:18:34</pubDate></item><item><title>HK | Beijing defends “severe punishment” for Jimmy Lai</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/hk-pequim-defende-castigo-severo-para-jimmy-lai/</link><description>The heavy sentence imposed on the former press tycoon received applause from Beijing for concluding that Jimmy Lai seriously endangered national security
The Chinese government yesterday defended that businessman and activist Jimmy Lai deserves a “severe punishment” for having “severely endangered” national security, following his sentence to 20 years in prison in Hong Kong.
At a press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian stated that Lai “was one of the main organizers and participants in a series of anti-China incidents that destabilized Hong Kong”, in a reference to the 2019 anti-government demonstrations.
According to Lin, the actions of the founder of the Apple Daily newspaper, which has since closed, “severely harmed the prosperity, stability and well-being of Hong Kong”. The central government “firmly supports” the authorities of the Special Administrative Region “in safeguarding national security, in accordance with the law, and in punishing crimes that put it at risk”, he added.
In response to international criticism of the sentence, Lin Jian urged “to respect China's sovereignty and the rule of law in Hong Kong”, asking that “irresponsible statements be avoided” and “stop interfering in Hong Kong's judicial affairs and China's internal affairs”.
Criticisms and appeals
The human rights organization Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) reacted to the decision, classifying the conviction as “political” and highlighting that Jimmy Lai, aged 78, was the target of a long judicial process, having been found guilty in December 2025.
The CHRD recalled that United Nations experts in 2024 considered Lai's detention as “arbitrary” and called for his release on humanitarian grounds after the December verdict.
The trial took place before three judges designated specifically for cases related to the National Security Law. The indictment attributed to the businessman a sustained campaign to promote international sanctions against China and Hong Kong, through Apple Daily and his network of contacts.
The defense argued that the published content was part of the public debate protected by the right to freedom of expression.
EU condemns sentence
The European Union (EU) yesterday condemned the 20-year prison sentence imposed on Jimmy Lai, a businessman linked to the media, by a Hong Kong court and demanded his immediate release. “The EU deplores the harsh 20-year prison sentence imposed on British citizen and media businessman Jimmy Lai by the Hong Kong High Court on 9 February 2026”, reads the statement published by the European Union External Action Service.
According to the diplomatic service of the European bloc, “the EU reiterates its call for the immediate and unconditional release of Jimmy Lai, also taking into account his advanced age and health”. “The political persecution of Jimmy Lai and former Apple Daily executives and journalists damages Hong Kong’s reputation,” the statement highlighted.
“Deserved” penalty
Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said yesterday that the founder of the Apple Daily newspaper, Jimmy Lai, “deserved” the 20-year prison sentence imposed on him. Lai was convicted of three counts of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces and publishing seditious material. Eight other defendants in the same case received sentences ranging from six years and three months to ten years in prison.
In a statement, John Lee stated that the 156 days of public hearings “with a large volume of evidence presented” proved that Jimmy Lai was “a despicable and unscrupulous anti-China leader”. “The defendant committed several heinous crimes and his malicious acts are beyond measure,” the official added.
For Lee, the heavy sentence “demonstrates that the rule of law is respected and that justice was served”, which “brings relief to everyone”. The Chief Executive admitted, however, that Hong Kong “has already paid a heavy price”, stating that many residents, especially young people, were “misled” by Apple Daily during the 2019 protests, becoming “radical”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:15:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Taiwan | Transfer of 40% of chip production to the United States rejected</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/10/taiwan-rejeitada-transferencia-de-40-da-producao-de-chips-para-os-estados-unidos/</link><description>Taiwan's vice leader said yesterday that it was "impossible" to transfer 40 percent of the island's semiconductor production to the United States, arguing that research and development of advanced technologies should continue to be carried out in Taiwan.
Cheng Li-chiun's statements come after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated last month that President Donald Trump's administration intends to move around 40 percent of Taiwan's semiconductor supply chain to the United States, following a trade agreement signed between Washington and Taipei.
“I clearly told the American side that this is impossible,” said Cheng on Sunday, during an interview with the CTS television channel.
The official highlighted that advanced chip manufacturing processes in Taiwan, essential for the development of artificial intelligence devices, represent around 90 percent of the value of global production. This dominance is the result of a semiconductor ecosystem built over decades and “cannot be transferred”.
Cheng stressed that, although it is not possible to “redistribute capacity”, there could be an expansion of the industrial presence in the United States. For bilateral cooperation in building the supply chain to be viable, the Taiwanese model must be adopted, something that, according to him, was welcomed by Washington.
The official also guaranteed that the existing science parks in Taiwan will not have an equivalent in the United States, ensuring that the capacity of the Taiwanese industry for manufacturing and advanced packaging of 'chips' will be “much superior” to facilities in the United States or other countries.
"It is essential to first establish factories in Taiwan and confirm the viability of mass production. Only then will companies expand with new investments abroad", argued Cheng, reiterating that technological innovation must continue to be carried out on Taiwanese soil.</description><pubDate>2026-02-10 02:11:06</pubDate></item><item><title>CNRS | 125 million year old dinosaur discovered with spikes identical to the porcupine</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/09/cnrs-descoberto-dinossauro-com-125-milhoes-de-anos-e-picos-identicos-ao-porco-espinho/</link><description>A new species of herbivorous dinosaur, which lived 125 million years ago and had spines comparable to those of a modern porcupine, was discovered in China, the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) announced on Friday.
In a statement, the CNRS stated that “until then, there was no evidence to prove the existence of such spines in dinosaurs” and explained that scientists named the new species ‘Haolong dongi’ in honor of Dong Zhiming, a pioneer of Chinese paleontology.
The investigation into the discovery was published on Friday in the journal Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution, reported the agency Efe.
The discovery in China of the exceptionally well-preserved fossilized skin of a young Cretaceous iguanodon led CNRS scientists and their international partners to use high-resolution X-ray tomography and histological sections.
The researchers were then able to observe skin cells preserved for 125 million years, which indicated the presence of hollow, horny spines on a large part of the body, comparable to those of modern porcupines in their defense function.
These protuberances also demonstrate a hitherto unknown evolutionary defense mechanism in iguanodons, a group of dinosaurs that, depending on the species, could measure between 6 and 10 meters in length and weigh several tons.
The study suggests that the spines played a role in thermoregulation (because they are hollow, they could have helped dissipate or absorb heat) or sensory perception (to detect movement or changes in the environment).
“As the ‘Haolong dongi’ specimen is a juvenile, it is not yet known whether these spines were also present in adults,” the CNRS further noted.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>South Sea | Beijing carries out air and naval patrols</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/09/mar-do-sul-pequim-realiza-patrulhas-aereas-e-navais/</link><description>Beijing revealed yesterday that it carried out air and naval patrols in the disputed South China Sea, in response to joint exercises carried out in January by the Philippines and the United States in these disputed waters.
The spokesperson for the Southern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) said that the patrols took place between February 2 and 6, without providing further details about the air and naval assets involved.
“In an attempt to provoke instability in the South China Sea, the Philippine side allied itself with countries outside the region and carried out so-called ‘bilateral air patrols’, which undermine regional peace and stability,” lamented Zhai Shichen.
In a statement, the spokesperson highlighted that Chinese forces “will remain on high alert” and “firmly defend China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests”. The maneuvers followed those carried out by Beijing, in the same waters, on January 25 and 26, after the Philippines and the United States organized a joint navigation exercise at Scarborough Atoll.
This atoll is known as Huangyan in China and Bajo de Masinloc in the Philippines, which ensure that the area is within Manila's exclusive economic zone.

China has canceled the death sentence of a Canadian accused of drug trafficking by Beijing, a Canadian government source said Friday, marking a new sign of reduced diplomatic tension between the two countries.
Arrested for drug trafficking, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg had been sentenced to death in January 2019, when tensions were very strong between Beijing and Ottawa, following the arrest, in Vancouver (western Canada), of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's financial director, at the request of the United States.
But relations have since calmed with the release of Meng Wanzhou and as US President Donald Trump's protectionist policies and sometimes erratic diplomacy have led Canada to move closer to China.
In mid-January, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney discussed a new partnership in Beijing, after years of disagreements.
A spokeswoman for the Canadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Ottawa had been informed of “the decision of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China in the case of Robert Schellenberg”.
“Canada advocated clemency in this case, as it does for all Canadians sentenced to the death penalty,” he added.
Arrested in 2014 for drug trafficking and sentenced in the first instance to 15 years in prison, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was tried again and sentenced to death in 2019. At the time, the court had considered the initial sentence too “lenient”.
The court had accused him of having played a “key role” in drug trafficking aimed at sending around 222 kilograms of methamphetamine to Australia. Already convicted in the past in Canada for drug trafficking, Schellenberg claimed, in turn, that he was just a tourist who had been caught.
The confirmation of his sentence occurred at a time when Meng Wanzhou was before a Canadian court for hearings dedicated to his possible extradition to the United States.
The financial director of Huawei and daughter of the founder of the Chinese telecommunications giant was accused of having lied to circumvent American sanctions against Iran. At the same time, China had also put two Canadian citizens behind bars, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, accused of espionage.
Although the three were, however, released, tensions persisted, with Beijing blaming Ottawa for its alleged alignment with Washington's Chinese policy, until Donald Trump's return to power and his interference in the Canadian elections.
Turn the page
When visiting Beijing in mid-January, Prime Minister Mark Carney wanted to turn the page on years of friction between the two countries. This was the first visit by a Canadian head of government to Beijing since Justin Trudeau in December 2017.
Although Canada has, historically, economically and politically, much stronger ties with its American neighbor, Canada and China have in common suffered, directly or indirectly, in recent years, the effects of President Donald Trump's aggressive policies, both against his rivals and his allies.
Carney made a commitment to see Canada double its exports to countries beyond the United States by 2035. And he highlighted the weight of China: the second economic power representing a third of global growth and with which trade supports hundreds of thousands of Canadians.
China is Canada's second trading partner, behind the United States. The volume of exchange of goods between Canada and China reached 89.62 billion US dollars in 2025.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 03:33:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Historic US allies cede influence to China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/economia-aliados-historicos-dos-eua-cedem-influencia-a-china/</link><description>The leaders of the United Kingdom and Canada “bowed to Beijing”, observed analyst Bill Bishop yesterday, in an analysis of recent diplomatic contacts with China, which reflect a distance from the United States.
“We had two of the United States' staunchest historical allies, two members of NATO […] effectively, in a way, bowing down to Beijing”, commented the analyst in his daily bulletin Sinocism.
Last week's visit by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the People's Republic of China – the first by a British head of government since 2018 – comes at a time when other Western leaders, such as those from France, Finland and Canada, are also seeking to strengthen ties with Beijing, in a trend towards diversifying alliances in the face of the unpredictability of North American foreign policy.
Although Beijing did not announce any major concessions to the British delegation, Starmer returned to the United Kingdom with a reduction in tariffs on British whiskey from 10 percent to 5 percent and with the promise of new commercial partnerships. A business delegation of around 50 companies, including AstraZeneca, accompanied the head of Government, and an investment of 15 billion dollars in China until 2030 was announced.
The visit was preceded by the approval, by the British authorities, of a project for a new Chinese embassy in London, blocked for several years, as well as the abandonment of a judicial process for espionage involving Chinese citizens.
For Bishop, Beijing's strategy does not aim to replace the United States as these countries' main ally, but rather to “explore the space left by fissures” in traditional relations with Washington. Starmer's visit, like that of the Canadian Prime Minister, is interpreted as a sign of openness to more pragmatic relations with two members of NATO and the “Five Eyes” information alliance.
“China continues to have a huge advantage in critical supply chains, such as rare earths,” recalled Bishop, referring to Chinese control over minerals essential to the industry.
A recent report by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) think tank pointed in a similar direction. The document concluded that Donald Trump's unilateral and transactional foreign policy is causing a global realignment, with several countries considering China a more predictable and, in some cases, more trustworthy actor than the United States.
Influence Maps
According to ECFR, only 16 percent of Europeans today see the US as a reliable ally. Among respondents in 21 countries, only 10 percent believe that the US will have more influence in the world within 10 years, while 36 percent believe in China. The report also highlighted that many citizens, both in Europe and in the so-called Global South, no longer see the world divided between two rival blocs, but rather as a multipolar space, where it is possible to maintain good relations with both powers.
For Bishop, China's objective is not to turn Western allies against Washington, but rather to take advantage of the divisions that have widened. “It’s not about turning them against the United States, but rather about expanding the space for influence and negotiation,” he stated.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 02:09:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Marcelo Loureiro, author and teacher: “The indigenato was a continuation of slavery”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/04/marcelo-loureiro-autor-e-docente-o-indigenato-foi-uma-continuacao-da-escravidao/</link><description>He was recently in Macau to present the book “Colonial Citizenship: law, race and rights through the Portuguese empire”. Marcelo Loureiro's work explores the way in which, in the Portuguese empire, Portuguese citizenship was shaped according to skin color. Macau was no exception, although with different contours compared to Africa, argues the professor at the University of Leicester

How did this investigation begin and how did the themes of colonialism and citizenship emerge?
Everything was born from a personal and family experience. I grew up in Rio de Janeiro, in a family marked by the Portuguese diaspora on the one hand, and colonial silence on the other. My paternal grandmother, Portuguese, kept the documents that allowed me, at the age of thirteen, to claim Portuguese citizenship in the back of a closet. My other grandmother, mestizo, cafuza, had no papers, no stories to tell; From her to me, there was only silence. This division, between those who have the right to documents and a voice and those who are forced to be erased, was the starting point for questioning the legal construction of citizenship and nationality. When I arrived in Portugal to study Law in Coimbra, I began to realize that the law that recognized me as Portuguese was the same one that historically denied this recognition to millions of people based on race, 'civilization' and skin color. The book is, in part, an attempt to understand this legal structure of inclusion and exclusion, it is a denunciation of the injustice behind rights. It is a denunciation of citizenship as a method of exclusion.
In the context of the Portuguese empire, when did the first notions of citizenship emerge and what criteria were used?
The first formal notions of national belonging in Portugal appear in the Philippine Ordinances of 1603, which establish who should be considered 'natural' of the kingdom. It is interesting to note that the inclusion of the notion of nationality was only included in Portuguese law during the Iberian Union, during the Philippine dynasty, when Spain controlled Portugal through the Habsburgs. It was in this context that Spanish law was transposed to Portugal to separate Portuguese from Spanish. However, the practical construction of Portuguese citizenship begins much earlier, in opposition: through slavery. Since the 15th century, with papal bulls (such as Dum Diversas of 1452 and Romanus Pontifex of 1454), Portugal obtained canonical legitimacy to enslave Africans and conquer their territories. Portuguese citizenship was thus constructed, in opposition to the figure of the ‘other’ – the Moor, the black, the pagan, the ‘savage’, and finally, the ‘indigenous’.
What were the differentiation criteria?
The criteria were essentially civilizational and racial: being Christian and, progressively, being white or recognized as ‘civilized’ according to European standards. Conversion to Christianity functioned, at times, as a kind of 'spiritual whitening', but even converts rarely achieved full legal equality, which continued to be imposed for centuries. The law called indigenous to all those who existed outside the standard of civilization expected of citizens, which were the non-white populations of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and Timor.
Macau will always have occupied a “privileged position” in the context of this empire. Specifically, how?
In terms of citizenship, Macau has never been subject to the Indigenous Statute, which was in force in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and Timor. This exclusion was not accidental. The Indigenous Statute applied to populations considered 'uncivilized' according to European racial and cultural criteria, being, in practical terms, essentially black populations from continental Africa and Timor. In Macau, the Chinese population, often called ‘Macau Chins’, although not European, were treated differently. There were laws that regulated the rights and customs of the Macanese population, with a complete law coming into force in 1909 and only abolished in 1949, for example. The Portuguese presence in Macau has always been accompanied by several other factors, such as British influence through contact with Hong Kong, the progressive political presence of Beijing, Portuguese political instability and the questioning of the existence of the Portuguese empire itself internationally. This meant that Portugal was unable to impose in Macau a sovereignty as powerful as that imposed in Africa and Timor.
Were there cases of discrimination against the Chinese and Macanese communities before the 20th century?
Discrimination existed, although of a different nature than that imposed in Africa. We can even see in literature, in the works of Senna Fernandes, for example, how the existence of walls, sides and parts of Macau, sometimes even ideological, for different populations, from Chinese villages to Christian cities. The same division occurred in the world of rights, only in an indirect way, and not through the direct imposition of indigeneity and the status of second-class national. Segregation and difference occurred socially, with difficulty accessing certain careers, the lack of invitations to birthdays because they were not ‘white’. This discrimination did not take the systematic legal form of indigeneity, as stated. The Macanese occupied an intermediate position, often functioning as intermediaries between the Portuguese and Chinese. Their ‘Portugueseness’ was recognized in an ambiguous way: they were Portuguese, but of a different type.
We can mention that skin color was decisive in not placing Macau under the Indigenous Statute.
Yes, skin color was absolutely decisive. The Indigenous Statute was applied in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and Timor, territories with populations that are mostly black or ‘non-white’ in the colonial sense. Portuguese law even created the term 'oceanic race' to identify Timorese during the imposition of indigenato so that they could bring this population racially closer to African populations. Macau, Portuguese India, Cape Verde, and, to a certain extent, São Tomé and Príncipe, were excluded from this classification. The official criteria established 'uses and customs' and 'civilization' as the parameters to identify these people, but in reality these categories only functioned as a substitute for race: they were race, but by another name.  The populations of Portuguese India and Macau, although not European, have always been spared the application of openly racist laws, despite local practices and policies imposing, most often indirectly, restrictions on the full citizenship of these populations, as I have described.
Taking into account the Indigenous Statute, what evolution can you trace in terms of the concept of Portuguese citizenship?
The Indigenous Statute, consolidated in the early 1930s, represented the maximum legal codification of racial exclusion. Indigenato was a legal form of racial segregation that created two categories of being Portuguese, namely being a Portuguese citizen (white and assimilated) and being indigenous Portuguese (the majority black). The indigenous people were legally Portuguese, but they were not citizens; they did not live with access to rights, but to restrictions, they lived, as I call it in the book, in a status of ‘negatory nationality’. Indigenous people could not vote, could not move freely, did not have the right to lawyers, were subject to forced labor, paid special taxes based on race, and could not attend the same schools or hospitals as whites. The evolution of the concept of Portuguese citizenship in this context is paradoxical: formally, everyone was ‘Portuguese’, but materially, citizenship was reserved for those who demonstrated ‘civilization’ through skin color or by proving themselves to be sufficiently assimilated despite being black. Assimilation was the only legal path to leaving indigeneity, but it required proving mastery of the Portuguese language, abandonment of African ‘uses and customs’, stable employment, ‘good moral conduct’, and military service.  Very few could.
What are the most flagrant cases of denial of rights that you can point to?
One of the most flagrant is the system of forced labor, which functioned as a continuation of slavery under another name. Indigenous people were forced to work on plantations, mines and public works, often far from their families, in inhumane conditions. Another case is spatial and social segregation: separate hospitals for whites and indigenous people, segregated neighborhoods, different schools. In Guinea, indigenous people were forced to wear necklaces with metal plates. In Mozambique they were forced to pay radio taxes if they had a device. In Timor they were required to pay taxes if they moved from one local authority to another, or when they divorced according to local customs. The archives also show cases of indigenous people who, despite having moved to Lisbon, still continued to be treated as indigenous people. All thanks to a 1955 law that imposed indigenato status on any indigenous person in any part of the Portuguese empire – which was previously only applied in indigenato colonies. This was the case of the so-called ‘Lisbon Requests’, a group of assimilation applications that I found in the Lisbon Ultramarine Archive, where indigenous people who, having emigrated to the metropolis, tried to obtain recognition as citizens.
The Indigenous Statute would be abolished years later, but the effects seem to have remained.
I absolutely agree. And I say more: indigenato was a continuation of slavery itself, a reflection that is still felt today by so many communities touched by the Portuguese empire. The Statute was abolished in 1961, but decades of legal, educational and economic exclusion are not erased by decree. African populations have been systematically denied access to education, property, mobility and political participation for generations. This explains, to a certain extent, the difference between the different parts of the Portuguese empire, where Brazil, Angola, Macau and India occupy completely different spectrums in relation to levels of protection and access to rights. When the Statute was abolished, a context of restriction and necessity was already consolidated where the black majority survived without formal education and without access to basic rights. The post-colonial effects are equally profound: indigenato taught generations of Africans that their culture, language and way of life were inferior, and that to formally be someone, to be recognized as fully human before the law, they had to become white, they had to resemble, as much as possible, the colonizer. But even this formal assimilation rarely translated into real protection: legal recognition did not guarantee effective access to rights. Assimilation marks not only a historical period, but a way of seeing, feeling and surviving colonial history. This violence left marks that persist in Portuguese-speaking post-colonial societies and that can only be resolved when there is a process of acceptance, truth and reconstruction — something that the Portuguese State has not yet been able to do.</description><pubDate>2026-02-04 03:57:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Exhibition | Eric Fok shows “Dreaming of the Occident” in Taiwan: “In Portugal, I see traces of my city”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/15/exposicao-eric-fok-mostra-dreaming-of-the-occident-em-taiwan-em-portugal-vejo-vestigios-da-minha-cidade/</link><description>The year began with a new project by Eric Fok, who despite living in Portugal did not leave Macau and the East. “Dreaming of the Occident” is on display at the Helios gallery, in Taipei, and can be seen until January 24th. To HM, the local artist reveals that he wants to artistically explore the universe of Vendas Novas bifana, through its connection to Macau pork chop
How is the West represented in this exhibition?
I've always been fascinated by the intersection between Eastern and Western cultures, and I've explored how Macau was a territory shaped by Western missionaries and navigators who brought new sciences and ideas to the East. Regarding a previous exhibition, and during the research process, I realized how rare it was for the Chinese to travel to Europe at the time of the Discoveries. I read with enthusiasm the reports of the few who did so. There are diaries that vividly recreate the dangerous sea voyages and what life was like in ancient European cities. This allowed me to project myself into their stories, bridging the gap between past and present, between East and East. These cultural differences are not just history to me, but have become a rich source of imagination for my new work.
As an artist from Macau, how has the history of the territory, marked by exchange between East and West, shaped your way of thinking about this exhibition?
It all started with mapping Macau for the “Paraíso” series [2014 exhibition], a project that was born out of my curiosity about the city's past in a context of rapid expansion of the tourism and gaming industries. Through this dialogue with local history, I began to truly understand the city. I went from focusing on the small details of urban life to having a macro perspective of the world, highlighting Macau's significant role in global history. This includes its status as a gateway to China during the Discoveries, its contribution to the beginning of globalization, or even being a space for the spread of Catholicism to the East. [We cannot forget] the profound influence of maritime culture. All of these themes constitute an extension of my exploration of the historical and unique experience of Macau.
Can you describe in more detail the creative process for “Dreaming of the Occident”?
In addition to maps of Macau, this exhibition also presents maps of Eurasia and several Asian colonies, where I explore themes such as navigation, trade and empire. My research also extends to experimenting with materials. In addition to using paper and wood, I incorporated unconventional supports, such as ostrich eggs. These objects function as canvases to narrate stories about endemic species and the history of migration, establishing a bridge between a biological and historical side.
Does the exhibition intend to criticize the Western influence in Macau, reflect on it or simply observe it?
In my exploration of these themes I am mainly interested in the cultural dimensions of history. When Europeans first arrived in Asia, they viewed the world from a Eurocentric perspective. The term “Far East” was not just a geographical designation, but a symbol of power and a specific view of the world. But, on the other hand, the term “Far West” represents an initial global imagination, in the sense of being a space of mutual understanding, albeit incomplete. Today, as we live in an era of a lot of information, where connectivity is instantaneous, we have lost that sense of mystery, and my work seeks to recover a little of what is the fantasy of distance.
Do you expect different readings of the exhibition or a deeper knowledge of what Macau is, in cultural and historical terms?
In the creative process, I privilege personal expression as responses to society and the world in which we live. Although exhibiting in a commercial gallery inevitably brings a market dimension to my work, my focus is always on the integrity of the work. In recent years, my desire for the public to “correctly decode” my art has changed, in the sense that, although I feel deep satisfaction when someone connects with my inner world, I have come to accept this “emptiness” in the narrative of my work. These gaps are meant to be filled by the experiences and emotions of the viewer, or perhaps by time and history itself. In a time of rapid and ephemeral changes, I use the brush to document and preserve. My work consists of sharing the urban experience that invites the public to create an emotional connection with cities, promoting a deep reflection on identity and belonging.
He has lived between Macau and Portugal. How does this influence your work and your view of Macau’s history and culture?
At the moment I respond to this interview I find myself in Vendas Novas, a town in Portugal that is famous for bifana. I am currently exploring whether there is any direct connection between this local specialty and Macau pork chop bread. Centuries ago, the Portuguese sought to build a “home” in Macau, leaving behind Portuguese structures that defined the skyline of my city. Currently, being in Portugal, I see traces of my city everywhere. Being Asian, and being surrounded by different races and languages, I find a certain sense of belonging that can be both alienating and deeply familiar. The enormous geographical distance is shortened by culture and history, which are shared. This exchange of identities and the movement between places constitute deep inspirations for my work.
Searching for an unknown place
On the Helios gallery's internet portal, Eric Fok's new exhibition is described as a search for a Europe that, on the eastern side, was known to exist, but which was far from being known, especially from the middle of the 16th century, when the term “Taixi” appeared as a reference to the “Great West”. The Chinese expression was used by the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci and is one of the focuses of the Macau artist's work in “Dreaming of the Occident”.
According to Helios' presentation, “Taixi” was a term attributed to “an extremely distant land in the West that was, once, a blank space on maps, yet to be explored”. In this way, Eric Fok's imagined maps explore the ideas of an absent and unknown place, also analyzing “the identity of the self, the transport of memories, power and ideology”. Using historical research, the Macau artist “rediscovers ‘Taixi’ from the perspective of the Far East, through writing and cartographic representation”. Eric Fok also investigated “the views of the world that existed in the past, formed by the interconnection between power and belief”, it is described.</description><pubDate>2026-01-15 01:53:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Iranian Ambassador in Lisbon condemned “institutionalization of the improper use of force”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/14/embaixador-do-irao-em-lisboa-condenou-institucionalizacao-do-uso-indevido-da-forca/</link><description>Iran's ambassador in Lisbon, Majid Tafreshi, condemned the “institutionalization of a new policy”, implemented with the instrument of “improper use of force”, alluding to the United States and Israel. In an interview with the Lusa agency, Tafreshi warned that this process will “spread” if countries, especially Western ones, “do not take serious measures” against the United States and Israel, “which have incited public unrest”.
“There are no guarantees that such practices will not be repeated, especially when disturbing discussions are already being heard, such as those regarding the possession of Greenland”, highlighted Tafreshi, remembering the North American actions in Venezuela, and the insinuations against Colombia and Cuba.
The interview took place before the diplomat was called by the Portuguese Government because of the violent repression of demonstrations against the Iranian Government, an announcement made yesterday by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Iranian diplomat recalled having already asked his “academic colleagues” and diplomats to create in Portugal a new forum entitled “Dialogue between Enemies”, in the search for “universal peace and a world free from war and tension”, as well as the creation of new mechanisms – such as an East Asian Union – “could constitute a meaningful initiative”.
“I believe that politics and politicians should follow more closely the will of their own people, who, in reality, do not seem to have major conflicts between themselves – as can be clearly seen in tourism, in football stadiums, in concerts and in hundreds of other human interactions”, argued the Iranian diplomat.
Regarding recent developments in Iran, in which, he said, peaceful demonstrations focused on economic challenges, over time, “some elements present in these concentrations escalated to violent incidents”, including armed actions that, according to reports, “involved individuals with prior training”.
“Regrettably, these events resulted in casualties among security forces, public order forces and ordinary citizens,” said Tafreshi, after the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, condemned and demanded an end to the “repression of protests in Iran, which have resulted in more than 600 deaths since December 28, according to a non-governmental organization.
Iran's ambassador in Lisbon referred to the “millions of Iranian citizens” who participated in public demonstrations on Monday, “reflecting a change in the general picture and expressing support for their Islamic country”, which, as in the past, the news received limited attention from the Western media.
Outside incentives
Asked about what is strangling the Iranian economy, Tafreshi highlights the interventions of Israel, “to a lesser extent”, and the United States, “which have encouraged public unrest”, as well as Iran's economic challenges, which are significantly influenced by extensive sanctions imposed” by Washington.
“These measures, which Iran considers illegal, have also been supported by European countries that defend human rights, despite there being concerns that such policies have negatively affected fundamental rights of the Iranian population, including access to healthcare”, he denounced.
“Respect for the Charter of the United Nations, the bitter lessons of the First and Second World Wars and the devastating experiences and costs of events in Afghanistan, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Ukraine and elsewhere should be enough to remind us of the urgent need to prioritize, more than ever, peaceful coexistence”, he added.
Regarding the high number of fatalities, Tafreshi denied that Iranian security is using a disproportionate use of force, exemplifying, alongside the high number of deaths among civilians, the significant number of deaths and injuries among police officers”.
People power
Asked about the words of Reza Pahlavi – son of the former shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, deposed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution – in which he stated that he intends to return to Iran soon, Tafreshi considered that, with the “support of some Western and Zionist media”, he appears to be trying to play the role of a “Robin of the Woods”.
"However, Robin Hood never called on ordinary people to resort to violence or violate international norms and principles, such as attacking embassies and diplomatic facilities. During his father's reign, despite Iran having the support of the United States and the West, the country lost its 14th province, Bahrain. Based on experience, the United States supports and exploits anyone capable of harming Iran's independence and security," he responded.
Tafreshi denied, on the other hand, that the regime – “the term “regime is an illegitimate and biased expression” – is at risk, highlighting again “the millions” of Iranians who demonstrated on Monday in favor of Iran's sovereignty.
“The Islamic Republic belongs to the people of Iran. Ayatollah [Ali] Khamenei is the leader of Iran and one of those citizens”, highlighted the diplomat, for whom China and Russia maintain “good relations” with Tehran, meaning it is not necessary to count on Beijing or Moscow to defend the country, which counts on its own people to protect its security and sovereignty.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 02:52:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Sofia Ferreira da Silva, author of a study on opera in the Mao years: “Silk Road was the biggest influence”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/07/sofia-ferreira-da-silva-autora-de-um-estudo-sobre-opera-nos-anos-de-mao-rota-da-seda-foi-a-maior-influencia/</link><description>In “Singing the Revolution: The Role of Songs and Opera in the Spread of Communism in Mao Zedong's China”, Sofia Ferreira da Silva analyzes the way in which songs and opera spread political ideals, leaving marks on the country's cultural panorama. The analysis came from the doctoral thesis in Artistic Studies, defended by the author at Universidade Nova de Lisboa
What was the musical environment like in the country before Mao Zedong came to power?
China was, and continues to be, a territory with a huge variety of practices at regional, local and ethnic levels. We can speak of four main types: music of a more erudite nature, symbolized by court music (yayue) and guqin music, more centered on Confucian ideals and with ritual functions and self-cultivation of individual morals; folk music, with vocal and instrumental genres varying according to region and ethnicity; Taoist, Buddhist and other religious music; and traditional opera, such as Kunqu and Peking, Sichuan and Canton operas, combining singing, declamation, stylized movements and martial arts. The biggest influence on Chinese music was, perhaps, the Silk Road, as a good part of the musical instruments that are now considered “Chinese”, such as the erhu, the pipa, the suona and the sanxian, have their origins in foreign instruments brought to Chinese territory, and which were gradually adapted and incorporated into their music. On the other hand, some narrative and operatic genres evolved from the adaptation and combination of counterparts from the territories crossed by this route. If it weren't for the Silk Road, traditional Chinese music would be radically different.
What other influences are there?
The other big influence is Western music. This, despite having entered the country in the 16th and 17th centuries, was felt with greater intensity from the middle of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century. The growing foreign presence and influence led to the systematic introduction of Western notation, academic training along European lines and Western classical and popular music genres, which would be assimilated in varying ways by Chinese composers, such as Ma Sicong, Li Jinhui or Xian Xinghai, combining them or not with traditional music motifs.
In the thesis, he talks about two major changes in the Mao years, with the creation of the so-called “model shows (yangbanxi)” and the revolutionary Peking operas. How did these formats help to reshape the music scene at the time?
The model shows, which include Peking operas and revolutionary songs, played an important role in reforming the Maoist musical landscape, implying changes not only in musical styles, but also in the social function of music. Production became entirely subordinated to the political project of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), resulting in the mandatory membership of artists and designated artistic associations, and the suppression, through criticism in the media, of musical elements or genres considered “feudal”, “bourgeois” or “superstitious”. In opposition, and following successive political movements and campaigns, other formats were promoted, more in line with the regime's ideals.
How, in concrete terms?
In the case of the “yangbanxi”, from the Cultural Revolution, the fact that they were called “model” implied that all new creations must strictly follow the aesthetic precepts established through them, especially the rules of the “basic task”, with the construction of revolutionary heroic figures as the ultimate aim of artistic creation. There were also the “Three Prominences”, with the attribution of greater or lesser prominence to a certain character depending on their degree of positivity or negativity, their function in the plot. These rules guided not only the narrative structure and the role of the characters, but also aspects such as the integration between music and gestures, the construction of costumes and sets, and the harmony between traditional and Western musical elements. This codification would aim, to this extent, to guarantee the ideological and aesthetic uniformity essential to the creation of a controlled, functional and politically effective musical culture within the framework of the objectives of the revolution.
What are the main political messages conveyed through these two types of shows?
The first big idea is the almost religious loyalty to Mao Zedong and the unconditional observance of his ideas. It is his thought that inspires and guides the actions of the heroes and heroic characters, the second most important category of characters in revolutionary operas, and leads them to the successful completion of the mission assigned to them or to heroic sacrifice in favor of the communist cause. The second is the class struggle as the driving force of history. We have, on the one hand, the oppressive, capitalist, imperialist and feudal class as the villain, and on the other the working people, exploited and oppressed by the former, suffering the greatest storms at their hands. The conflicts and difficult situations faced by the heroes or other positive characters, such as the death of family members, imprisonment or slavery, were always the direct expression of this struggle, and their resolution would only come from the revolutionary stance and the assumption of an active role in the construction of socialism.
And the third idea present in the shows?
This is collectivism, as a true revolutionary places the interests of the Party and the People above any individual dream or desire. No matter how prominent his role, the hero needs popular support to complete his mission: his aspirations are the aspirations of the people, and it is in solidarity between all that difficulties are overcome and the much-desired socialist harmony is achieved. Personal achievement only has value if it serves the collective cause, and individual sacrifice is glorified when it contributes to common progress. Operas promote, to this extent, a worldview where individual identity dissolves into the identity of the revolutionary collective, and where the active participation of the masses is not only desirable, but necessary.
These were years of so-called cultural Maoism, as mentioned in the thesis. How is it characterized?
Cultural Maoism presents points of contact regarding the subordination of art to politics, the valorization of the daily lives of the masses as the raw material for creation and the defense of its widespread popularization. However, it is distinguished by its emphasis on the proletarianization of the artist himself, who should abandon his position as a distant intellectual and become an active member of the working people, learning through practice and inserting himself in their daily struggles.
What are the main influences of this movement?
In addition to the Marxist-Leninist matrix, cultural Maoism would be marked by Confucian influences, giving art an ethical and formative function, as in Confucius, Mencius or Xunzi, art shaped character. However, in the Maoist context, this molding was channeled towards the construction of socialist consciousness and the eradication of traces of the bourgeois mentality. One of the central principles of this policy was the “mass line”, a kind of circular cultural dynamic in which popular ideas and expressions were collected and systematized by the Party, before being returned to the people in a clearer and more politically oriented way. Another aspect to consider is the appreciation of native and foreign cultural heritage, condensed in the maxim “use the past to serve the present, use the foreign to serve China”.
In what way?
To create new artistic works, Mao recommended the initial study of Western works, considered “scientific” and technically superior, before selectively incorporating elements of Chinese tradition. In both cases, the value of artistic forms lay in their social and political function, not in their preservation as heritage. In this context, the PCC leader proposed two criteria for artistic evaluation: the political, which required the promotion of national unity and the rejection of ideas contrary to the Party; and the artistic, which presupposed technical and aesthetic rigor following an abstract notion of “scientific criteria of art” at the service of the masses. This double requirement replaced, in Maoism, the Confucian distinction between moral quality and aesthetic quality.
In these years, what were the biggest influences on songwriting?
The composition of songs was greatly influenced by two great musical traditions: the native, with the use of regional melodies and motifs and those of the various ethnic minorities that make up the territory; and the Western, in which I include the Soviet musical tradition, most visible in marches and so-called “art songs”, which could be understood as a type of revolutionary ‘lieder’ or with highly politicized content. The influence of each of them was more or less visible depending on the political situation of the territory.
How did the years of “cultural Maoism” change the country’s musical landscape?
Some aspects of the production of Cultural Revolution operas, such as the introduction of the Western orchestra and the use of techniques from Western music, the incorporation of more realistic scenarios and the melodramatic nature of the stories influenced and continue to influence the production of new Beijing operas, especially those with contemporary or historical themes relating to the 20th century. XX. Over the last 30 years, operas with historical themes have also been produced with some of these elements, especially in terms of music and settings, such as “Cao Cao and Yang Xiu”. Some remnants of this period can also be seen in the interpretation of traditional operas, especially in the presentation of arias or excerpts on television programs. I see countless performances that combine, just like in the revolutionary repertoire, arrangements with a Western orchestra and realistic scenarios, with extensive use of new technologies. However, what I consider to be the greatest remnant of revolutionary operas will, perhaps, be a greater artistic audacity on the part of the creators of new operas. It is an issue that deserves further study by the academy, but, from my observations as a spectator, I notice a greater openness to the incorporation of elements from other arts, such as dance and theater, and a greater complexity in the characters, especially those considered negative, less antagonistic, with more nuances when it comes to motivations for acting in a certain way. It is obvious that the psychological suffering inflicted by these operas on an entire generation of Chinese people is undeniable and cannot, under any circumstances, be forgotten; however, model operas boosted the creative impetus of composers and librettists, in line with the evolutionary process, of fusion with other arts, of Peking Opera over the centuries.</description><pubDate>2026-01-07 01:10:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist activist, 34 years old, physical engineer, Romani national. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied this right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on staying, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
What are you talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Motorsport | New alternative will be created in Foshan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/26/automobilismo-nova-alternativa-vai-ser-criada-em-foshan/</link><description>Motorsport in the urban core of the Pearl River Delta will have a new permanent infrastructure, after the first fixed circuit was announced in the city of Foshan, located around 120 kilometers from Macau
The official announcement was released in the first week of the year. The result of an investment led by Benchmark Global Group, the project aims to mark a relevant milestone for Guicheng, the urban center of Nanhai district, consolidating Foshan as an international hub for sports consumption and stimulating high-level development in the areas of culture, sport and tourism. Benchmark Global Group had already developed reference projects in Sanshan in partnership with Key Capital, RDM and other entities, including Guangfo Florentia Village, Zona Artística One Times, Hilton Hampton Hotel and Chimei Art School.
According to the statement, “the circuit aims to attract a younger audience and boost the surrounding area”. Inspired by the successful experience of the Tianjin V1 Auto World, whose layout is used in local competitions, the V1 Guangfo International Circuit aims to create an integrated car park, combining the race track, motor culture and themed entertainment. The complex will occupy approximately 141,666.7 m² and will have all the necessary support infrastructure.
According to the tender documents, the land is located on Sanlongwan Avenue, in the south, and Gangzhong Street, to the west, with a lease period of twenty years and planned use as an ecological and sports car park. The project also includes a kart track of at least 1.1 km, while the main circuit should reach FIA Grade 2, allowing it to host competitions promoted by the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC).
The development aims to “strengthen Guicheng's emerging consumption and entertainment ecosystem”, complementing the surrounding commercial hubs and enhancing the urban functions of the Wenhan Lake International Scientific and Technological Innovation Cooperation Zone. Residents and visitors will benefit from more diverse and sophisticated leisure experiences.
Foshan is one of the national pilot cities dedicated to new formats and consumption models, promoting innovation and economic dynamism. The V1 Guangfo International Circuit will represent a concrete example of the application of these guidelines, focusing on diversified consumption scenarios and sustainable growth in the sector.
 
Other options
In the Greater Bay Area, motorsport has focused on the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) and the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC) in Zhaoqing, but several recent projects indicate a growing effort to expand the infrastructure network, including the possible construction of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit in Doumen, with an initial investment of 250 million renminbi and FIA Grade 3 certification.
In 2024, before the return of the Formula 1 Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai, Guangzhou announced plans to build a Grade 1 circuit, capable of hosting events in the premier discipline. So far, no new information has emerged about this project, which was intended to be the second Formula 1 circuit in China. The first, in Shanghai, was opened in 2004, as the Zhuhai International Circuit, the first permanent circuit in China and designed to host Formula 1, never received maximum approval from the FIA. Other projects designed in Hong Kong and Shenzhen have not taken shape until now.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | Rui Valente questions staying in motorsport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/gp-rui-valente-questiona-permanencia-no-automobilismo/</link><description>Rui Valente had a 72nd Macau Grand Prix to forget. To the point that the driver with the most years of activity in motorsport in the territory seriously admits the possibility of hanging up his helmet and putting away his gloves, or, at least, stopping competing in Macau's premier race, be it the Macau Roadsport Challenge or even the entire event.
 
 
“There are a number of factors that lead me to question whether it makes sense to continue,” Rui Valente told HM. The experienced Touring car driver points out several reasons for this reflection, namely “the fact that Grand Prix races are of much less interest today, as they are almost always contested behind the Safety Car, the current scoring system for Macau qualification and the attitude of some drivers on the track”.
The most recent edition of the Grand Prix did not leave good memories for those who made their debut at the Guia Circuit in 1988. The Macau Roadsport Challenge weekend started negatively for the Portuguese driver, who did not avoid touching the rails in the Paiol area during free practice on Thursday, an incident that affected his entire performance. After achieving the 25th best time in the qualifying session, misfortune manifested itself again in the race, when the recovery attempt at the controls of the #16 Subaru BRZ ended prematurely on the approach to the São Francisco Curve. On the restart after the first Safety-Car, Rui Valente was hit by Li Kwok Chuen, in a maneuver in which the Hong Kong driver attempted to overtake on the inside, in a place where there was no available space.
"Even today I can't understand what went through his head. I don't know how he saw a space that simply didn't exist. Maybe he thought I was going to lift my foot to let him pass", recalled the driver, who has thirty-six participations in the Macau Grand Prix and was one of the nine representatives of the Macao SAR in the 2025 edition of the Macau Roadsport Challenge.
 
Qualification lottery
Rui Valente has been one of the most critical voices of the current qualifying model for the Grand Prix, which mainly benefits those who finish one of the races in the top ten. The use of identical vehicles by all competitors, Toyota GR86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8), accentuates the balance of movement on the track. Added to this factor is the fact that only four races count towards qualification and that the grids often have more than three dozen participants, transforming each race into an authentic “pitched battle”, in which the objective is to achieve a top result in a single race to guarantee the points necessary to be on the starting grid for the event in November.
“With so many cars on the track at the same time, there are many drivers under enormous pressure to score points, which ends up causing a high number of incidents”, admits the Portuguese driver. “In this way, the qualification is closer to a lottery than a process truly based on merit”, adds the Premium Racing Team representative.
On the other hand, Rui Valente recognizes that younger people are the main losers. With experience clearly superior to that of newcomers, who have fewer kilometers of track and less competitive experience, the driver emphasizes, even so, that the difficulty is not restricted to newcomers. "Even for those who have been racing for many years, like me, qualifying is extremely complicated. If this is the case for the more experienced, it becomes clear that young people end up being the most penalized by this model", he concluded.
 
Next step
As for the future, Rui Valente – who received the award for third place among Macau drivers in Group A of the MTCS Macau Roadsport Challenge, at the 2025 Awards Ceremony of the General Automobile Association of Macau-China – has not yet made a definitive decision. The alternatives on the table include remaining in competition along the same lines, considering a change of category, an option conditioned by budgetary limitations, or, ultimately, putting an end to their participation in the Grand Prix, or even their career.
The second driver with the most participations in the history of the Macau Grand Prix, just behind Albert Poon, confesses that he has not lost his love for motorsport, an activity that keeps him in excellent physical shape at 64 years old. However, he admits that "perhaps it's time to leave Macau. It's a shame, because I really like this. In fact, the problem is that I like this a lot."</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 01:56:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Lamborghini | Asian debut of the Temerario GT3 could be in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/09/lamborghini-estreia-asiatica-do-temerario-gt3-podera-ser-em-macau/</link><description>Lamborghini said goodbye to the Huracán GT3 at the 2025 Macau Grand Prix and is now aiming for the Asian debut of the recently launched Temerario GT3, scheduled for November, on the streets of our city
The ninth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup, scheduled for the 19th to 22nd of November at the Guia Circuit, appears as the likely stage for the debut on the Asian continent of the latest competition car from the Sant’Agata Bolognese brand, in a season in which the new twin-turbo V8 engine model will mainly be in a phase of competitive consolidation in Europe and the United States of America.
Due to the limitations inherent in the production and delivery of new cars, Lamborghini Squadra Corse never seriously considered the introduction of the Temerario GT3 in the Asia-Pacific market in its launch year, despite the interest expressed by several teams, including JLOC, the formation of the Japanese Super GT championship that local driver André Couto represented. Even so, there is a clear desire on the part of Automobili Lamborghini's competition department to put its new GT3 on the track in Asia this year, precisely in the context of the Macau Grand Prix.
“I can confirm that no Temerario will be entered in the GT World Challenge Asia or other regional championships,” explained a spokesperson for the Italian brand to the Portuguese portal SportMotores.com. "However, we are working on the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau, a race of enormous importance for us, where we intend to be present in the best possible way. At this stage, we cannot provide any further details."
The possibility of Lamborghini competing this year in the Macao SAR race with the old Huracán GT3 is ruled out. The model faced difficulties in 2024 related to the introduction of the mandatory and controversial torque sensors. Edoardo Mortara had a particularly ungrateful weekend, seeing his third best time in Super Pole canceled for exceeding the maximum power limit, later ending up abandoning the main race when his car shut down.
Production limitations
Unlike other competition departments of major manufacturers, the Lamborghini Squadra Corse is a relatively small structure. The main limiting factor in the implementation of the Temerario GT3 this season, especially outside Europe, is related not only to the availability of units, but above all to the priority given to adequate technical support from the factory.
The United States of America, where the car will make its competition debut at the 12 Hours of Sebring in March, continues to assume a strategic role for Lamborghini, hence the brand's full-time presence in the IMSA SportsCar Championship through the Pfaff Motorsports team. For the current season, Lamborghini Squadra Corse has allocated seven examples of the Temerario GT3 to competition in Europe, divided between the GT World Challenge Europe and the DTM. The Italian manufacturer plans to field three cars in the GT World Challenge Europe and four in the DTM.
Mercedes-AMG evaluates return
The absence of Mercedes-AMG in last year's edition was one of the most talked about topics in the paddock. This decision was justified by the lack of opportunities for Asian client teams to test the complex torque sensors, at a stage in which the Stuttgart brand is going through a demanding process of transitioning its sporting activities from HWA to the new subsidiary Affalterbach Racing.
“At this stage, it is not possible to say whether a Mercedes-AMG GT3 will compete in the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau in 2026,” an official source from the German manufacturer, who maintains high interest in the MSAR event, told Hoje Macau. "The race is extremely appealing, both from a sporting and strategic point of view. We will carefully analyze the conditions at the appropriate time and evaluate them together with the interested teams."
It should also be noted that the Macau Grand Prix could symbolize the definitive goodbye of the current Mercedes-AMG GT3, as the star brand is already developing the next generation of its car for the category, whose debut in competition could take place in 2027.</description><pubDate>2026-02-09 03:50:25</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | The driver with the most victories in the history of the race has passed away</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/02/gp-faleceu-o-piloto-com-mais-vitorias-da-historia-da-prova/</link><description>British John Macdonald passed away last week, aged 89, after a prolonged illness. He was the most successful driver in the history of the Macau Grand Prix and the only one to triumph on the Guia Circuit in both car and motorcycle races.
The news was released on social media by his friend Eli Solomon, a historian and writer based in Singapore, who in recent years worked, together with Angus Lamont, on the production of the book “King of Macau”. The work portrays the life and career of Macdonald, who lived for decades in Hong Kong and was one of the central figures of motorsport in Southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s.
"It is with deep sadness that I announce the passing of John Macdonald, which occurred on Sunday, January 25th, at the age of 89, after a prolonged illness. His mind remained as clear as ever, and he and Angus Lamont continued to work on King of Macau until the end of last year", wrote Eli Solomon, adding that "the final text was presented to him for approval at the end of last year, with the book expected to be ready for distribution this quarter, possibly in time for the deliveries in the UK for the Goodwood Members’ Meeting in April”.
John Macdonald remains the only competitor to have won all the main races held on the Guia Circuit: four victories in the Macau Grand Prix (1965, 1972, 1973 and 1975), the triumph in the 1969 Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix and victory in the inaugural edition of the Macau Guia Race in 1972. However, his passion for motor sport was not limited to racing in circuit. After starting out on motorcycles in the United Kingdom, he participated in the 1962 Central African Rally, driving a Lancia B20, and in 1963 in the Scottish International Rally, in a Land Rover. That same year he moved to Hong Kong, where he joined the local police. Throughout his career he won three international rallies, two in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines, the country where he became National Champion in 1974.
During his stay in Hong Kong, he was the owner of Camlex Garage, in Kowloon, after leaving Hutchinson, where he held the position of Group Service Director of Far East Motors, at the end of 1967. After retiring from business activity, he sold Camlex Garage, in 1981, to German Motors, owned by businessman and also pilot Herbert Adamczyk.
Eternalized with the wax statue in the Macau Grand Prix Museum, Macdonald was also associated with the famous phrase: “Motor sport is the only truly exciting sport that can be practiced sitting down”.
Sum of successes in Macau
His debut at the Macau Grand Prix took place in 1964, with a sixth place at the wheel of a Lotus Elan, in what was his first experience in speed racing in cars. The following year he returned with a Lotus 18, a formula purchased for 7,000 patacas from the renowned Team Harper, and his performance at the wheel of an already aged single-seater was widely praised. After a race marked by incidents and some confusion, he took the checkered flag in first place and achieved the first of his six victories on the Guia Circuit.
With the introduction of the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix into the program in 1967, Macdonald could not resist taking part, also benefiting from the experience gained in the two-wheeled races he had competed in the United Kingdom at the end of the 1950s. In that debut year, marked by Japanese dominance, he did not stand out, but went on to win the race in 1969.
His second victory at the Macau Grand Prix came in 1972, driving a Brabham BT36 ex-Graham Hill, after an absolutely dominating performance, crossing the finish line with a 30-second advantage over second place. On the same weekend he also won the first edition of the Macau Guia Race, in an Austin Mini Cooper S, a replica of which is now on display at the Macau Grand Prix Museum.
With sponsorship and equipment to match his talent, he returned in 1973 to defend the Macau Grand Prix title, this time in a Brabham BT40, with which he had won in the Philippines and at the Malaysian city circuit of Penang, in addition to achieving third place in Singapore. After taking pole position, he became the first driver to win the race three times, also setting a new lap record.
His fourth and final victory at the Macau Grand Prix came in 1975, nine years before the race adopted Formula 3 regulations, at the wheel of a Ralt RT1. Faced with the strongest opposition yet, Macdonald prevailed again, recording his final triumph in the competition. His last participation in the Macau Grand Prix occurred in 1976. His farewell to Grand Prix racing as a driver took place in May 1977, at the Penang Grand Prix, although in that same year he continued to be linked to Macau as a sponsor, giving his Ralt RT1 to Vern Schuppan. He left Hong Kong in 1983 and moved with his wife to Andorra. His last years of life were spent in Mauritius.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Coloane | Kartódromo hosts the Champions of the Future Academy Program</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/09/coloane-kartodromo-recebe-o-champions-of-the-future-academy-program/</link><description>The Coloane Kartdrome will start the year at high speed, hosting from the 16th to the 18th of January the first edition in the territory of the new Champions of the Future Academy Program competition, organized and promoted by the Swiss company RGMMC Group
The Champions of the Future Academy Program is an international Arrive and Drive karting competition designed to develop the next generation of motorsport talent. According to the promoter, the event is aligned “with FIA sporting standards and combines elite competition with comprehensive training for drivers, offering young people the experience and international visibility necessary to launch professional careers, while keeping costs under control”.
With three competitive categories — Mini, OK-N Junior and OK-N Senior — the concept aims to bring together emerging talents from around the world to compete in world-class events. According to the organization, this event in Macau “aims to expand the Champions of the Future Academy Program to national series”, reinforcing the presence of the concept outside its main calendar.
In addition to the event in Macao, RGMMC, founded in 2004, also has a non-championship event planned in the United Arab Emirates in February. The regular championship consists of six stages, taking place between February and December, with visits to Spain, Greece, Italy, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The same entity also promotes a series along the same lines in the United Kingdom.
The Champions of the Future Academy Program Macau, which has the support of the General Automobile Association of Macau-China (AAMC) and the MSAR Sports Institute, will take place over three competitive days, with two final races that determine the classification of the event winner for each category. The paddock will open to teams on Thursday, followed by a full day of free practice on Friday, while timed training and racing will take place on Saturday and Sunday.
Equal for everyone
Each category admits a maximum of 24 competitors, a limit that remains the same in all events. The Mini Group 3 category, aimed at drivers between 9 and 12 years old, will use Parolin chassis and TM engines, with a registration cost of approximately 32,750 patacas. The OK-N Junior categories, for ages between 12 and 14, and OK-N Senior, for ages 14 and 17, will compete with Kart Republic chassis and IAME engines, with the registration fee being around MOP42,125 per weekend.
As the name Arrive &amp; Drive indicates, these values ​​include the kart and its engine, space in the tent, necessary tools, tires — supplied in all classes by LeCont Pneumatici —, fuel, lubricants and all associated logistics. This way, drivers can focus exclusively on driving and, thanks to mechanical equality, competitive and lively races can be expected at one of the best kart tracks in Southeast Asia.
In 2026, the Coloane Kartódromo will have a particularly busy calendar. In addition to the karting and motorcycling competitions organized by the AAMC, the route designed by architect Carlos Couto will host the Chinese Karting Championship, on the 11th and 12th of April, the IAME Series Asia, on the weekend of the 23rd and 24th of May, and the Macau International Karting Grand Prix, scheduled for the period between the 11th and 14th of December.</description><pubDate>2026-01-09 02:34:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Davis Cup | Tiago Pereira makes his national team debut with China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/09/taca-davis-tiago-pereira-estreia-se-pela-seleccao-com-a-china/</link><description>Tiago Pereira is the new addition to the national tennis team for the Davis Cup match with China, on February 6th and 7th, which also includes Nuno Borges, Francisco Cabral, Jaime Faria and Henrique Rocha, it was announced yesterday. “Tiago Pereira has been improving a lot and, in recent months, he has obtained good results not only in singles but also in doubles, which makes him an option for both variants”, said captain Rui Machado about the debutant.
In addition to the 21-year-old Algarvian, ranked 265th in the world rankings, Rui Machado's bet was on Nuno Borges (45th) and Francisco Cabral (20th), the best Portuguese tennis players today in singles and doubles, respectively, in addition to Henrique Rocha (157th) and Jaime Faria (151st).
Portugal has not competed at home since September 2022, then against Brazil, and the visiting condition has been favorable, but Rui Machado is confident in the group he will take to China.
“We are aware that it will be a very difficult tie against a team with experienced players, with a lot of potential and who have already proven that they can play at a very high level”, he considered, without knowing his counterpart Di Wu's chosen ones. Portugal will visit China in the play-off of Group I of the Davis Cup in tennis, in which they will try to avoid relegation to Group II, where they have not been since 2015.</description><pubDate>2026-01-09 02:28:28</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
