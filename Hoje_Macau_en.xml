"I like President Xi from China, I always liked it and I will always like it, but it is very difficult," said the US leader on his Truth social network the day when customs on steel and aluminum imported by the US increased to 50 percent.
Trump's statements come at a time when US press advances with the possibility of the two leaders approaching a final deal by telephone that attenuate commercial tensions.
It was not clear if Trump spoke to Xi, however. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused the United States on Tuesday to violate the provisional trade agreement in Geneva last month by imposing "negative measures," such as the latest restrictions on semiconductor exports or the annulment of visas from Chinese students. Wang made those statements during a meeting with the new US ambassador to China, David Perdue.
"Unfortunately, the US recently introduced a series of negative measures based on unfounded fundamentals, impairing China's legitimate rights and interests," Wang said during the meeting in Beijing, according to a statement widespread by the Chinese government. Wang called on the US to "create the conditions necessary for [bilateral] relationships to return to the right way."
Trump has previously been confident that a conversation with XI can relieve commercial tensions, although it is not clear that this call is being organized.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 00:06:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Zone A | Open public tender for five commercial spaces</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/05/zona-a-aberto-concurso-publico-para-cinco-espacos-comerciais/</link><description>The Housing Institute (IH) is holding a public tender for the granting of five commercial spaces in the public housing venture in zone A of the new landfills, namely for restaurants, a banking unit or a pharmacy, and four spaces are located in the Tong Chong building and the other in the Tong Kai building, both on the Avenida do Mar de Mirror, in the new landfills.

For several years based in Berlin, Cheong Kin Man has been a visual artist and anthropologist who has never left experimentation aside. Now, alongside the Polish artist Marta Sala, has been embedded in new artistic directions, which, this time, flow into Lisbon.
This happens in multiple forms. First with the show “The Slazing and Curious Travel”, which will be evident at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) between tomorrow and July 6. Curated by Lorena Tabares Salamanca, from Colombia, the show is a “cross -cultural exposure that crosses art, visual anthropology and personal archives, reflecting on displacements, memory and languages”, with the signature of Cheong Kin Man, Marta Sale and Deborah Uhde from Germany.
The public can see “immersive installations, textile pieces, video and self-ethnographs that reconfigure the relations between travel, history and knowledge,” says a press release of the Poland City Council. In the inaugural session of this Thursday there will also be a conversation with the artists, which is repeated on Friday, but this time at the Goethe Institute library in Lisbon at 18h.
Here, in “Creating Connections”, a conversation with the three artists of “The Slazing and Curious Travel”, which is “an intimate artistic meeting, in which Deborah Uhde, as well as the duo Marta Stanisława Sala and Cheong Kin Man, will share among themselves-and with the public-reflections on their practices and experiences in creating intercultural bonds through art, especially art, with emphasis on art. their paths in Berlin and the latest artist books. ”
These initiatives are supported by the Poland Embassy in Portugal, the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage and the Adam Mickiewicz Institute of Poland. They also have the partnership of the City Council of Krakow and the Boym Institute, also from Poland.
Fusions and Travel
The show that now presents at CCCM brings works of the duo Cheong Kin Man - Marta Sala, known “by the fusion of fabric, video and language experiments”, in which the public can “embark on a trip through parallel worlds and personal files” based on three multimedia projects, such as “The Utopian's compass”, “Revelations” and a new cycle of Macaense diaspora.
In the case of “The Utopia Compass”, it is a “bamboo and fabric installation composed of 13 textile compositions that materialize processes of cultural discovery and mutual learning”, and the work is inspired by the “Flora Sinensis” (1656), by the Jesuit Miguel Boym, who studied in Krakow; as well as “in the musicality of Cantonense poetry translated into chromatic shapes and in self-ethrical motifs associated with the migration of a Macaense family and the contemporary trips of the artists”.
In turn, the “Revelation” series, presented for the first time at the Macao Biennial in 2023, “combines text, textiles and video in a science fiction narrative”, and the fabric “which integrates this fiction coding episodes of the Polish family archive, including migration through the borders of the twentieth century - from Vilnius to the Mongolian steppes and, later, to current Poland”.
Also noteworthy is that the exhibition reveals “the experimental film project based on interviews within the Macaense Diaspora”, taking the public to Brazil, “where the nostalgia shared by humanity echoes in automatic translations for various languages”. There are also, associated with the video, the new publication entitled “Entrevista, MięDzy-Wizje. Roz-Mowa, disorder”, which is “in the form of Flipbook with Luso-Polaco glossary, which deconstructs an excerpt from the recording to reflect on each word said and the limits and possibilities of translation”. This Thursday's CCCM session begins with a guided tour of the artists at 5 pm, including the launch of "Revelation", a new book by artists.
In the case of Deborah Uhde, who accompanies the pair of artists from Macao and Poland, is a filmmaker and artist graduated in beautiful art and humanities, residing in Berlin. Obtained his diploma at the Art University of Braunschweig (2009–2015). It has a formation in Philosophy, History of Art and Journalism from the University of Leipzig (2006–2009). Deborah's work was recognized with several bags and awards.
New book
The duo Kin Man - Sala brings to Lisbon the new edition of the book "Revelations", which includes "a collection of fictional ideograms originally created at the house of Krakow in Nuremberg, the only cultural institution in the municipality of Krakow outside Poland."
This reprint now has over 600 pages and was supported by the Oriente Foundation. The artist book was originally commissioned for the Macau Biennial in 2023, containing “hundreds of ideograms originating from the Copenhagen with Love Exhibition,” held in Nuremberg in 2024, with the support of the East Foundation and the Municipal Chambers of Krakow and Nuremberg.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:49:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Burlas | More than 1,800 detainees in extended Asian operation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/burlas-mais-de-1-800-detidos-em-operacao-asiatica-alargada/</link><description>More than 1,800 people were detained in an operation against networks dedicated to Asian -mounted mounted mounted mocked mesh, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Maldives. In Macao, the Judiciary Police revealed the detention of nine suspects, who will have missed 84 victims in about 4 million Patacas
 
An operation, which crossed seven jurisdictions in Asia, resulted in the detention of 1,858 people linked to fraud and burlans networks. The operation, which involved authorities from Hong Kong, Macao, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Maldives, intercepted funds from Hong Kong's $ 150 million $ 150 million schemes, Hong Kong Police Crimes Department, Wong Chun-Yue, said.
In Macao, according to the Judicial Police (PJ), nine people were arrested, including three who were undergoing Alipay customer service officials, Macau Daily Times said. The head of the PJ Burlas Coordination Center, Cheong a Hong, revealed that the scheme will be started in April with over 400,000 so -called fraudulent all from Macao.
Locally, 84 victims were embezzled by about 4 million patacas in Alipay's burla scheme. The PJ operation culminated in search of two locations, including a hotel room, where 16 devices were found that allow to hide the origin of the calls.
But in total, the PJ investigated 78 cases that will result in losses of about 12 million patacas, in the freezing of eight bank accounts and in 67,000 patacas confiscated on suspicions of being raised through crimes.
Opening the angle
The joint operation has involved 9,268 cases of fraud, including online purchases, telephone throlles, investment slops and employment frauds, with a total loss of $ 225 million, according to data advanced by Hong Kong police, cited by Global Times. In total, 32,607 bank accounts were frozen and about $ 20 million in fraudulent funds. The detainees are between 14 and 81 years old.

The victim transferred $ 499,000 to Hong Kong, said the assistant director of the Singapore Police Anti -Freed Command, Aileen Yap, adding that through transionic cooperation, the money was recovered.
A United Nations report in April found that transnational groups of organized crime in East and Southeast Asian are spreading fraudulent operations around the world.
According to the report issued by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, for several years the groups proliferated in the southeastern Asian continent, especially at the borders of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, as well as in the Philippines, transferring operations from one place to another to escape the police. The centers of the schemes set up in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos are known to attract people to work, using false arguments.
Victims of online burlas and fraud also include workers used in operations that face threats, violence and poor working conditions. Employees are often forced to financially explore people around the world, and many are arrested in virtual slavery.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:31:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Literature | Macau project for childhood arrives in Portugal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/literatura-projecto-de-macau-para-a-infancia-chega-a-portugal/</link><description>The objective of the Association syllable - Educational and Literary Association (syllable - AEL) goes through Macao and bring the literary project “Dinis Caixapiz” to the universe of Portuguese -speaking countries
 
The head of the literary project “Dinis Caixapiz”, born in Macau to encourage reading among the little ones without forgetting environmental responsibility, told Lusa yesterday that the second edition has the merit of arriving in Portugal as well. "We can launch in Lisbon, this for me is the highlight," he told Lusa Susana Diniz, president of Sílba - Educational and Literary Association (syllable - AEL), author of the initiative.
Despite the starting point of this literary project “Always Macao”, because it was in the Chinese region “that was thought and created, with the aim of giving a reading alternative to students who learn Portuguese”, “Dinis Caixapiz” had soon had the objective of reaching the universe of Portuguese -speaking countries.
Now, the invitation of the Portuguese Association of Editors and Devices (APEL), to launch the project, on June 7, at the 95th Lisbon Book Fair, approaches the syllable - AEL of this purpose.
"The idea is to transport [the initiative] to Portugal and then to the communities. It has to leave somewhere. Leaving Lisbon, the doors open more easily," said the president of the association. Also on June 7, the 2nd edition will be launched in Macao, in the Garden of the Consulate General of Portugal, an event integrated in the celebrations of June-Month of Portugal in Macao.

The president of Supermarket and Liveliod Food Association of Macau points to the change of consumer patterns and the increase of Chinese products on local surface shelves, due to the most expensive prices of imported goods
 
After having passed through the rain drops during the pandemic, and even increased invoicing, the large surfaces of Macao supermarkets now cross a period of weak businesses and “unprecedented challenges”. The panorama of difficulties was described by the president of Supermarket and Liveliod Food Association of Macau, Wong Man Wai.
Recently, some supermarkets have closed, including from the Royal and Tai Fung chain, in places such as Jardim Camões and In Areia Preta, with other stores to launch total settlement discount campaigns, implying that they can also end. At Wong Man Wai's optics, this scenario will force chains to think of making adjustments to their operations to adapt to the change of population consumption habits.
Speaking to the newspaper or Mun, the associative leader explained that consumers not only buy less, but they are more selective in choosing goods in the face of “cost-effective”. "In the past, people bought more products imported from abroad, which were more expensive, but now they choose more different products from the interior of China," said the leader, adding that the prices of goods purchased abroad makes them "inventable". For this reason, "supermarket chains do not dare import in large quantities."
The two edges
With the disappearance of foreign products and product proliferation on local supermarket shelves, Wong Man Wai states that consumers can see this adjustment as an incentive to make shopping in Zhuhai, as they will buy the same products in either way. The official also stressed the fact that the large supermarket chains were left out of the big consumption award campaign.
However, not only stores are impacting the low confidence of consumers, also suppliers, especially those who operate outside the most touristy areas, are suffering from a 30 percent reduction. But those who are suffering more, according to Wong Man Wai, are the small and medium suppliers, who face risks of survival and marked breakdare of orders.
High costs with human resources and logistics of supermarkets since the race for home delivery services started other elements highlighted by Wong Man Wai, which places supermarkets in a difficult position to compete with electronic trade platforms in the interior of China.
The leader also mentioned the possibility, which was advanced by various media, opening a large supermarket in Gongbei as the “gout of water” for many surfaces in Macao, which can close within a year.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:25:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Health | Zhong Nanshan continues to lead expert commission</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/saude-zhong-nanshan-continua-a-liderar-comissao-de-especialistas/</link><description>Chinese epidemiologist and pulmonologist, who has become known worldwide during the pandemic, will continue to preside over to the Specialist and Advisory Commission for the appreciation of traditional Chinese drugs for another three years
 
Epidemiologist and pulmonologist Zhong Nanshan will continue for another three years to preside over to the Commission of Experts and Advisers for the appreciation of traditional Chinese drugs.
The renewal of the appointment of one of China's most media figures during the pandemic and the implementation of the zero policy of COVID-19 was published yesterday in the official bulletin. The decision was made by the secretary for social and cultural affairs, LAM, and will come into force on June 23.
The Specialized Commission has as its functions the authorization, renewal, change, suspension and cancellation of the registration of traditional Chinese drugs and evaluation of quality, effectiveness and safety of these same medicines. The opinions are issued at the request of the Institute for Pharmaceutical Supervision and Administration (Isaf).
The renewal of the appointment is not a surprise, since Zhong Nanshan only fulfilled a mandate as president, which is renewable.
In addition, in February this year, about two months after the executive's head of the Chief Executive, the interior doctor of China was received by Sam Hou Fai at the Government's headquarters, as a member of the Chinese Engineering Academy, director of the Guangzhou Laboratory, and chairman of the Guidance Commission of the Macao Translational Medicine and Innovation Institute.
Also in 2020, due to the role of consultant from the Macao government during the pandemic period, Zhong Nanshan received the Honor Sente Great Lotus Medal.
New appointment
Regarding the other members of the Commission, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, chose not to make major modifications. Zeng Li, Rector of the School of Medicine, Macao University of Science and Technology (Must) becomes part of the 17 members of the commission. Li will replace Michael Yao Specialist in Chinese and Academic Medicine that was also linked to Must. The reasons for the substitution were not advanced.
The other experts appointed are Liu Liang, Yang Changming, Han Wei, Wang Yitao, Zhang Law, Yang Zifeng, Du Shouying, Ji Shen, Zhou Hua, Chen Xin, Li Shaoping, Lee Ming Yuen, Yan Ru, Li Jun and Mo Hui.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:19:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Cooperation | A look at the approach to Spanish -speaking countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/cooperacao-um-olhar-sobre-a-aproximacao-aos-paises-de-lingua-espanhola/</link><description>The MSAR was already approaching Spain, but the chief executive began to refer to official speeches the importance of cooperation between Macao and Spanish -speaking countries, as well as the usual Lusophone world. Analysts relate these words to the current panorama of relations between China and Spain
 
The chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, has expressed in some discourses the importance of having to establish economic and commercial relations not only with Portuguese -speaking countries, but also with Spanish -speaking ones. Last month, on a public occasion, the government leader stated that the territory has to "welcome foreign friends to invest in Macau and also to realize his dreams in Macao." Sam Hou Fai highlighted the area of ​​advanced technology, stressing that “they can come from Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries” because “as long as they are in favor of economic diversification, they are always welcome,” he added.
Moreover, after the inauguration of the new government, Tai Kin IP, secretary for the economy and finance, made, in March, a visit to several European countries, leading a delegation that passed through Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Monaco to deepen “international links and explore opportunities for cooperation”, according to official information released at the time.
This approach to the Spanish -language universe, in addition to the usual connection already established between China and the Lusophone world, can have several origins: the growing relationship between China and Spain, as well as the desire to diversify the economy by MSAR, say analysts contacted by HM.
“The interpretation of Sam Hou Fai Declaration is very objective and pragmatic and can be summed up to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Portuguese-speaking countries. But the fact is that companies and institutions in Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in response to this need for Macao. For cooperation it seems logical to me, ”said economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, former resident of Macao and president of the Silk Route's New Friends Association (ARS).
According to the leader, “Macau is a pure market economy, is classified by the World Trade Organization as a free port with its own international agreements both in the economic, commercial, investment, financial, health, sports, sports, international relations agreements with various organizations. Therefore, the business in Macau is very free, and the part of the government of Macau is to promote and frame this opening”. "As Sam Hou Fai says, all companies and investors who bring Macao economy diversification solutions are welcome," he added.
To Cátia Miriam Costa, professor at ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon, and specialist in Chinese foreign policy and Macao, considered the HM that “this connection to the Spanish stems from the high -level official visits made by the Spanish government to China, that is, there is certainly one of the consequences of the repeated presence of Spanish diplomacy on a very high level, reinforcing the ties between the two. countries ”.
THE IMPORTANCE OF GLOBAL SOUTH
It is true that Beijing, in the words of President XI Jinping, has shown great interest in the approach of the countries of the so -called “global south”, where Portuguese and Spanish speaks, essentially. For Cátia Miriam Costa, here also resides another explanation for the change of paradigm in the field of commercial and economic cooperation.
"It seems to me that recent meetings with high Spanish political representatives have influenced this decision, along with China's increasing political investment in the global south where Portuguese and Spanish are, in fact, the most spoken languages."
For Académica, "the strategy of using Macau as a convergence point may be historically justified by its cosmopolitanism, but also by its traditional role in including the routes that connected Asia to Latin America." In addition, "adds to a historical perspective, a contemporary view for a region that needs economic diversification and benefits from this proximity to distant spaces, whether historical or culturally." Cátia Miriam Costa understands, therefore, that "Spanish can be seen as an additional value to Portuguese, without distorting the paradiplomacy strategy defined for Macao early on."
The inclusion of Equatorial Guinea in the Macao Forum cannot be ignored, as a result of its entry to the CPLP - community of Portuguese -speaking countries. However, Cátia Miriam Costa believes that this change has little or nothing to do with the inclusion of Spanish -speaking countries in the official commercial approach discourse.
"The inclusion of Equatorial Guinea in the Macao Forum stems from another circumstance, that of his participation as a member of the CPLP. In this sense, it was a logical step to its integration into the dynamics of the Forum. However and although it can count as a positive element in this approach, the leverage that Equatorial Guinea has in the Hispanic or Hispanic speaking world," he pointed out.
ASES BY ARE
Maria Fernanda Ilhéu also highlighted the fact that the only direct air connection between Macao and Europe will be for Madrid and not to Lisbon. “By chance, TAP or the Portuguese government have contacted Air Macau or the Macao government expressing interest in resuming this airline? I don't know, but I know that this connection will greatly contribute to strengthening the Spanish presence in Macao, whether in tourism, commerce or investment.”
The guardian highlights the complementarity factor of the air route. "Is the Portuguese and Spanish presence in Macau is incompatible? It doesn't look like, but it is competitive, it may even be beneficial if they know how to collaborate and gain scale in the Great Bay area, but Portugal has to strive more to their presence in Macau is not a historic relic."
Moreover, the economist does not forget the role that Portuguese foreign policy may play in this issue, with the removal of Huawei in Portugal and a closer approach to Beijing in recent times.
“Portugal's decision banning the use of Huawei equipment says mainly respect for the economic relations of Portugal with mainland China and it is framed by a fearful diplomatic relationship that the Portuguese government followed from 2019 to 2024, contrary to the Spanish diplomatic relationship. It should be noted that the Spanish Prime Minister visited China several times during this period and the Portuguese government alone was represented by the foreign business minister. At the Boao Forum in Hainan, with a brief pass for Beijing. ”
Thus, Maria Fernanda Ilhéu understands that between 2019 and 2024 “the Portuguese government and the Portuguese civil society were very conditioned by the American narrative of cold war and the formation of two antagonistic blocks, not knowing how to keep the line followed by 2019 to proceed with a relationship with China supported by the friendship and confidence of nearly 500 years of cooperation in Macau”.
The necessary work
For the economist and president of ANSRs, it is necessary to take into account the investments and business movements made in recent times to perceive the position of Portugal and Spain in this domain.
“The last major investment of a large Chinese company in Portugal was registered in 2020, and only now is this type of investment with Calb investment [SINE Battery producer] that is in the implementation and licensing phase. If we see the same type of investments in Spain from 2020 to 2024 we can record five major energy investments, by China Three Gorges and Huadian; Transport, Geely, Chery Auto and Envision Group; a major investment in agriculture by Yankuang Beijing Energy and also a major investment in the health sector by Worg Pharmaceuticals. ”
For the official, “a lot of work will have to be done by the new Portuguese government to develop Portuguese economic cooperation with mainland China and MSAR, but it will also have to be accompanied by Portuguese business fabric”, he summarized.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:17:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs | Trump says it is “extremely difficult to reach an agreement” with Xi Jinping</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/05/tarifas-trump-diz-que-e-extremamente-dificil-chegar-a-um-acordo-com-xi-jinping/</link><description>United States President Donald Trump said yesterday that he appreciates the Chinese counterpart, but that it is “extremely difficult to reach an agreement” with Xi Jinping at a time when the two countries lock a trade war.

For several years based in Berlin, Cheong Kin Man has been a visual artist and anthropologist who has never left experimentation aside. Now, alongside the Polish artist Marta Sala, has been embedded in new artistic directions, which, this time, flow into Lisbon.
This happens in multiple forms. First with the show “The Slazing and Curious Travel”, which will be evident at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) between tomorrow and July 6. Curated by Lorena Tabares Salamanca, from Colombia, the show is a “cross -cultural exposure that crosses art, visual anthropology and personal archives, reflecting on displacements, memory and languages”, with the signature of Cheong Kin Man, Marta Sale and Deborah Uhde from Germany.
The public can see “immersive installations, textile pieces, video and self-ethnographs that reconfigure the relations between travel, history and knowledge,” says a press release of the Poland City Council. In the inaugural session of this Thursday there will also be a conversation with the artists, which is repeated on Friday, but this time at the Goethe Institute library in Lisbon at 18h.
Here, in “Creating Connections”, a conversation with the three artists of “The Slazing and Curious Travel”, which is “an intimate artistic meeting, in which Deborah Uhde, as well as the duo Marta Stanisława Sala and Cheong Kin Man, will share among themselves-and with the public-reflections on their practices and experiences in creating intercultural bonds through art, especially art, with emphasis on art. their paths in Berlin and the latest artist books. ”
These initiatives are supported by the Poland Embassy in Portugal, the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage and the Adam Mickiewicz Institute of Poland. They also have the partnership of the City Council of Krakow and the Boym Institute, also from Poland.
Fusions and Travel
The show that now presents at CCCM brings works of the duo Cheong Kin Man - Marta Sala, known “by the fusion of fabric, video and language experiments”, in which the public can “embark on a trip through parallel worlds and personal files” based on three multimedia projects, such as “The Utopian's compass”, “Revelations” and a new cycle of Macaense diaspora.
In the case of “The Utopia Compass”, it is a “bamboo and fabric installation composed of 13 textile compositions that materialize processes of cultural discovery and mutual learning”, and the work is inspired by the “Flora Sinensis” (1656), by the Jesuit Miguel Boym, who studied in Krakow; as well as “in the musicality of Cantonense poetry translated into chromatic shapes and in self-ethrical motifs associated with the migration of a Macaense family and the contemporary trips of the artists”.
In turn, the “Revelation” series, presented for the first time at the Macao Biennial in 2023, “combines text, textiles and video in a science fiction narrative”, and the fabric “which integrates this fiction coding episodes of the Polish family archive, including migration through the borders of the twentieth century - from Vilnius to the Mongolian steppes and, later, to current Poland”.
Also noteworthy is that the exhibition reveals “the experimental film project based on interviews within the Macaense Diaspora”, taking the public to Brazil, “where the nostalgia shared by humanity echoes in automatic translations for various languages”. There are also, associated with the video, the new publication entitled “Entrevista, MięDzy-Wizje. Roz-Mowa, disorder”, which is “in the form of Flipbook with Luso-Polaco glossary, which deconstructs an excerpt from the recording to reflect on each word said and the limits and possibilities of translation”. This Thursday's CCCM session begins with a guided tour of the artists at 5 pm, including the launch of "Revelation", a new book by artists.
In the case of Deborah Uhde, who accompanies the pair of artists from Macao and Poland, is a filmmaker and artist graduated in beautiful art and humanities, residing in Berlin. Obtained his diploma at the Art University of Braunschweig (2009–2015). It has a formation in Philosophy, History of Art and Journalism from the University of Leipzig (2006–2009). Deborah's work was recognized with several bags and awards.
New book
The duo Kin Man - Sala brings to Lisbon the new edition of the book "Revelations", which includes "a collection of fictional ideograms originally created at the house of Krakow in Nuremberg, the only cultural institution in the municipality of Krakow outside Poland."
This reprint now has over 600 pages and was supported by the Oriente Foundation. The artist book was originally commissioned for the Macau Biennial in 2023, containing “hundreds of ideograms originating from the Copenhagen with Love Exhibition,” held in Nuremberg in 2024, with the support of the East Foundation and the Municipal Chambers of Krakow and Nuremberg.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:49:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Shanghai | Foundation Serralves presents almost a century of Álvaro Siza Vieira</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/xangai-fundacao-serralves-apresenta-quase-um-seculo-de-alvaro-siza-vieira/</link><description>The Foundation of Serralves inaugurates this week, in Shanghai, a major exhibition dedicated to Portuguese architect Álvaro Siza Vieira, with drawings, models, sculptures and objects that reflect several decades of the Pritzker Award work.
Titled Álvaro Siza: The Archive, the exhibition will be evident between June 6 and September 7 at the Power Station of Art, the first Public Museum of Contemporary Art of Continental China and headquarters of the Xangai Biennial.
This is an adaptation of the C.A.S.A. Show, presented in Serralves in 2024, and represents the largest exhibition ever held on the work of Álvaro Siza, according to a note spread by the organization.
Curated by architect António Choupina - in collaboration with Siza Vieira and Carlos Castanheira - the exhibition is jointly organized by the Museum of Serralves and the Power Station of Art, and proposes a chronological reading of the Portuguese architect's work over almost a century, from their childhood designs to the various typologies that define their path.
In all, the exhibited pieces occupy almost a kilometer of extent extent, the organization said. “Set about art, geometry and beauty, this exhibition presents a portrait of Siza as a true contemporary thinker whose practice continues to resort to drawing as a tool to unravel the internal mechanisms of architecture and thought,” reads the statement.
The 91 -year -old Porto architect has some important works in China, developed in collaboration with Carlos Castanheira, including the water building, in Huai'an (East), and the Ningbo Museum of Art and Education. The exhibition also marks the 30th anniversary of the Gemination Agreement between the cities of Shanghai and Porto.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 01:02:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Airbus | China Negoceia Buying Hundreds of Airplanes</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/05/airbus-china-negoceia-compra-de-centenas-de-avioes/</link><description>China is considering the possibility of ordering hundreds of airplanes from European Construtora Airbus next month, at the time of the 50th anniversary of official relations between the country and the European Union, Bloomberg yesterday advanced.
According to the news agency, which cites unidentified sources, the business may focus on about 300 narrow and narrow fuselage aircraft, while another source advances with 500 devices, which would constitute one of the largest airplanes in history and the largest for China.
In any case, these sources claim that negotiations are still open and that the business may not materialize or be closed on a later date.
So far, neither Airbus nor the Chinese authorities responsible for the aircraft negotiations have issued any official confirmation on the subject. France and Germany, two of the countries that control Airbus, will be able to send their leaders, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz, to the China - EU, which takes place in July, in Beijing.
New alliances
If the agreement is signed at that time, it may also be interpreted as a sign of Chinese President Xi Jinping to his US counterpart Donald Trump that he intends to strengthen commercial ties with the EU, at a time when Beijing's ties with Washington deteriorate due to trade war between the two powers.
However, Bloomberg points to Airbus's main rival, the American Boeing, as one of the potential winners of a hypothetical trade agreement between Beijing and Washington. In the recent Commercial Pact with the UK, one of the most important points was precisely the sale of aircraft.
But Boeing has been in difficulties in the Chinese market for years, compared to commercial tensions and concerns about the security of its planes, which resulted in a ban of nearly five years of 737 MAX, after two accidents with a total of 346 dead in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
This, associated with other temporary prohibitions, such as the ban, for a month, between April and May, from the delivery of Boeing aircraft to Chinese companies due to the escalation of the trade war between Beijing and Washington, allowed Airbus to gain advantage in China in recent years. Boeing has not received a major order from China since at least 2017.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 00:04:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Borders | More than 390 thousand visited Macau on the weekend</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/fronteiras-mais-de-390-mil-visitaram-macau-no-fim-de-semana/</link><description>Last weekend, due to the Dragon Boat Day holiday, 390,442 visitors entered Macao, according to data released by the Public Security Police (CPSP), a total that represented an increase of almost 14 percent over the same period last year.

The government now predicts that revenues have a break of 12 billion patacas, forcing the budgetary review yesterday by André Cheong yesterday
 
Yesterday were released by the Executive Council, the data on the budget review for this year, which happens due to the low forecast of the amount of gross revenues of the game, which depend, on large scale, the local economy and public revenues.
Thus, if the executive initially estimated that the game's gross gross revenues would be, this year, from 240 billion patacas, this value now drops to 228 billion, or 12 billion. Regarding the average monthly estimate, 19 billion patacas in gross revenues are now foreseen, because "the situation is not like the one planned."
In yesterday's presentation, the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, and also spokesman for the Executive Board, said that “after study and analysis of the current global economic conjuncture and the effective situation of exploitation of the game sector from the beginning of this year to the present moment, it is proposed that the annual estimate of gross revenues of the game will be reduced from 240 billion to 228 billion, thus serving as to Main base of the financial budget financial revenues, and that relevant budgetary revenue rules are properly adjusted. ”
In November last year, when Ho Iat Seng was about to leave the position of Chief Executive, predictions for gross revenues were 240 billion, taking into account the initial version of the budget proposal for 2025. At the time, the forecast represented an increase compared to what had been estimated to 2024, which situated the gross revenues of casinos by 216 billion Patacas, an increase of 11.1 percent. Given the gross game recipes in 2023, the estimate for 2025 was a 31.1 percent increase.
It is important to highlight that the new forecast below expected is an annual increase of only 0.5 percent in gross revenues, when the initial numbers translated into annual growth of 5.8 percent. In the first five months of this year, the game's revenues rose only 1.7 percent annually to 97.7 billion patacas.
Balance Guarantee
In response to journalists, the subdirector of finance services, Ho Silvestre in Mare, said the new calculations were based on the data provided by the Directorate of Inspection and Game Coordination Services (DICJ) in contrast to the first semester public expenses.
“In this proposed budget law we made an analysis of the global conjuncture and took into account a different model regarding the consumption of tourists in Macau. We made general considerations for these estimates and, according to DICJ, from January to April this year, an average of 19 billion and there was an increase to 21.1 billion (gross revenues). reaching the 20 billion [ragous game revenues, on average], so in the second half of the year there will be uncertainties. ”
"In this budget we intend to take a balance in expense and revenue. After an evaluation at the first half of the year, we can make an assessment taking into account the amount of 19 billion Patacas, and according to the current expense of the MSAR, we were able to get a more balanced budget," he added.
In general terms, and according to the explanatory note presented by André Cheong, the total amount of the ENGRICIAN INTEGRATED ORDINARY BUDGET for the 2025 economic year is 116.5 billion, when a revenue of the 121 billion patacas was expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to reduce the DSF's gross revenue revenue. The cut is 4.56 billion patacas.
In addition, the official said, only the reduction in the tax raised on the game, due to the break in gross revenues, translates into 450 million patacas for the administration. It should also be noted that budgetary expense within the PIDDA [Administration Development Investment and Development Plan] is reviewed to about 19.587 billion Patacas.
Budgetary expense rises 2.5 percent due to education and social support
The government ensures that, in the proposal for a budget for this year, the construction of a new campus of the University of Macau (one) on Hengqin Island will contribute, in part, to the increase in expense, around 2.5 percent, as well as “the increase in the budget in relation to subsidies attributed to vulnerable groups and investment in research and scientific and technological development”.
In the budget proposal presented yesterday, there is a approximate amount of 1.7 billion Patacas for the construction of the new UM campus, said the subdirect of Finance Services (DSF). In addition, at the level of scientific and technological investment was added the amount of 340 million patacas “for investments in the scope of science and technology, such as the acquisition of laboratory devices, to satisfy the measure and policies of the Government of Masters,” said Ho Silvestre in Mais.
"For construction is expected an expense of about eight billion patacas. As the campus is built on Hengqin Island, the cost must be calculated in Renminbis, which is about seven billion. This is the data we can have at this time," said the official.
Support for support
With regard to social support, the budget proposal for this year reveals an increase of 2.86 billion of Patacas in the expected expenses, as a way of reinforcing these supports. In total, the rise in expenses is 2.5 percent, to 116.2 billion patacas.
As for the preparation of the budget for next year, it is being prepared and the watchword is containment. "We are already elaborating the budget for the year 2026, and all services of the Government of MSAR need to consider more about their expenses, especially given the current conjuncture. In the budgetary elaboration phase we take a prudent and rigorous attitude towards the expenses," said the subdirector of DSF.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:29:05</pubDate></item><item><title>EU has to be “much more vocal” about Israel in Gaza</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/03/ue-tem-de-ser-muito-mais-vocal-sobre-israel-em-gaza/</link><description>Former European doctor Elisa Ferreira demanded yesterday to the European Union to be “much more vocal” about the boundaries that Israel “is surpassing” in the war against Hamas, defending an articulated voice of the community bloc.
"Europe, even because of all the defense of human rights, has to be much more vocal to saying to Israel that it cannot exceed the boundaries it is exceeding, and that current international agreements do not allow certain actions," Elisa Ferreira said in statements to Lusa after a conference at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau.
However, the academic noted that Member States have never attributed competencies to the European Union in defense that allow it, for example, to intervene with armament in cases of country invasions.
"That said, many countries-Ireland, Spain-they moved a lot, and I think there is a joint and joint voice to prevent us with a sense of impotence in the face of deaths that are absolutely unacceptable in the 21st century," said the former Minister of the Environment (1995-1999) and territorial planning (1999-2002) in the governments of António Guterres. Elisa Ferreira stressed that there have already been “there were some expressions of this will” by Lisbon and expects “to keep up”.
PEACE STEPS
In late May, Slovenia, Spain, Ireland and Norway, who recognized the Palestinian state a year ago, appealed to all countries to do the same compared to Palestine and Israel, as it is a necessary step for peace in the region.
"We remember that recognition is another step towards the implementation of the solution of both states and we appeal to the international community to take the necessary steps to make it a reality, among them, the individual recognition of Palestine and Israel by the countries that have not yet done it," reads a "joint statement."
Israel's retaliation for Hamas' attack on October 7 caused more than 54,000 dead, the destruction of almost all Gaza strip infrastructures and the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of people.
Elisa Ferreira wants to look for new partners like China
Former European doctor Elisa Ferreira defended Lusa yesterday that the European Union must rethink partnerships and look for new interlocutors, including Beijing, to keep “a great actor” on the international scenario.
"If there is an opportunity in every crisis, as I think the Chinese say, there is also an opportunity in this US leadership crisis, because it has shown us that Europe has to know where it wants to go and not lose control over its own agenda, and, on the other hand, it has to diversify partners abroad," said the former Portuguese minister in Macao, after a conference at Consulate General.
In the current context of instability, China “has to be a great partner,” said the academic. "China is a great power. I think it has always been latent, now it is completely affirmed, especially in future areas, in stories of new digital and environmental technologies." "For a long time, Europe wanted to be driving out of new clean energy, energy savings technologies, etc.; I think China, when it defines it, when it determines, when it is organized, accelerates with an unstoppable speed," he noticed.
In Macao at the invitation of the Institute of European Studies, Elisa Ferreira inaugurated yesterday the “conversations in the Consulate” cycle, with the lecture “Portugal: from the successes of the democratic Portugal to the crossroads of the present”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Dsal | Number of work accidents suffers slight breakdown in annual terms</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/03/dsal-numero-de-acidentes-laborais-sofre-quebra-ligeira-em-termos-anuais/</link><description>Data related to occupational accidents last year reveal stability compared to 2023: about five thousand people, 5,095, suffered accidents at work, slightly less than 5,293 victims of 2023, while the number of deadly victims arising from these incidents remained in a dozen

According to the DSAL report released last year, there were 5,293 victims of occupational accidents in 2023, and almost all occurrences (5,253) resulted in temporary work disability. Only 30 cases resulted in the person's permanent disability, and 10 people died. Last year, DSAL also recorded the same number of deaths from occupational accidents, and a case is associated with an alleged “infringement of occupational safety and health legislation”.
"All mortal cases were sent to the court organs for due processing, and, later, DSAL will adjust the data in accordance with the judgments given," reads the report relating to 2024.
DSSA says investigations to all labor incidents, having applied fines to two entities for “infringements to occupational safety and health”, in cases involving two workers. In addition, fines to 43 persons were applied for infringement of the legal regime of reparation for emerging damages of occupational accidents and occupational diseases, involving 303 workers in total.
More men than women
The report also presents more specific data on occupational accidents last year. Thus, of the 5,095 cases, 5,063 resulted in temporary disability, and 557 workers managed to return to service on the same day of the occurrence of the accident highlights DSal. However, a total of 22 people ended up having permanent disability. Noteworthy is the number of people who were hit in the hands (1,336), followed by accidents in the feet zone with 894 occurrences, various parts of the body with 831 cases, and accidents in the trunk zone with 743 cases.
Statistical data also show that men dominate with regard to victims: thus, in 2024, 255 victims aged between 16 and 24 years. In this age group, 165 men suffered occupational accidents as opposed to 90 women. The numbers rise in people aged 25 to 44, in which there were 2,719 occurrences, reaching 1,568 men and 1,151 women.
From 45 to 64 there were 1,908 occurrences, this time, more women than men: 1,188 compared to 720 male workers. Highlight for 213 cases of occupational accidents involving people at renovation age, ie 65 years or older, where 120 women were affected in contrast with 93 men.
The 2024 data also look at the type of profession in which more accidents occurred: dominate the “administrative employees”, with 1,318 cases, followed by the “staff of services, sellers and similar work”, with 1,207 cases, as well as “unqualified workers” with 1,219 occurrences. There were also 413 occurrences in the group of “workers of industrial production and artisans” and 196 in “operators of machines, drivers and assemblers”. In the category of “intermediate level technicians and professionals” 420 work incidents were recorded.
Let's go by parts
If we look at the numbers of occupational accidents taking into account the branch of economic activity, it is observed that they dominate “cultural and recreational activities, lottery and other services”, therefore, to the game and entertainment sector, with 1,512 cases occurred last year. Following are accidents in “hotels, restaurants and the like”, with 1,293 cases, as well as 414 incidents in the area of ​​“transport, storage and communications”. In the construction sector, there were 374 accidents.
It should be noted that the 2023 data is also similar in terms of economic activity where more work accidents occurred and in terms of the gender of workers, with 52 percent of men and 48 percent of affected women. In 2023, there was a higher incidence of occupational accidents in ages between 25 and 44 years, representing 53.6 percent, while at the age of 45 and 64 years, the percentage of accidents lowered to 37.2 percent.
The 2023 DSal report also showed that “cultural and recreational activities, lottery and other services” (29.5 percent), “hotels, restaurants and the like” (23.2 percent) and “transport, storage and communications” (10.8 percent) occupied the first three positions compared to the total number of occupational accident victims.
Regarding the professions, the “unqualified workers” (26 percent), the “staff of services, sellers and similar workers” (24 percent) and the “administrative employees” (22.9 percent) occupied the first three positions in relation to the total victims of occupational accidents.
Action and reaction
The 2024 DSA DSA report also reveals that 3,550 inspection visits were made to different workplaces, such as construction shipyards, industrial and commercial establishments, which resulted in 395 improvement recommendations and fines in 10 situations due to lack of safety.
Last year, four suspensions of the operation of shipyards were ordered in the context of occupational safety and health verification, the most serious consequence after the application of fines or awareness.
Dsal also points out that, last year, 404 seminars were performed for different sectors and types of work, which had the participation of 17,148 people. Regarding courses on occupational safety and health, formations were carried out to obtain the occupational security card in the construction, with 26,590 participants, which resulted in the issuance of 25,069 cards. The “Safety Training Courses in Specific Construction Works” had 3,167 participants, and 2,895 certificates were issued.
In another important area for the local economy, hotel and restoration, 25,965 participants participated in the “training courses to obtain the occupational safety card in hotel and restoration”, with the issuance of 25,020 cards.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 01:08:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Cooperation | A look at the approach to Spanish -speaking countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/cooperacao-um-olhar-sobre-a-aproximacao-aos-paises-de-lingua-espanhola/</link><description>The MSAR was already approaching Spain, but the chief executive began to refer to official speeches the importance of cooperation between Macao and Spanish -speaking countries, as well as the usual Lusophone world. Analysts relate these words to the current panorama of relations between China and Spain
 
The chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, has expressed in some discourses the importance of having to establish economic and commercial relations not only with Portuguese -speaking countries, but also with Spanish -speaking ones. Last month, on a public occasion, the government leader stated that the territory has to "welcome foreign friends to invest in Macau and also to realize his dreams in Macao." Sam Hou Fai highlighted the area of ​​advanced technology, stressing that “they can come from Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries” because “as long as they are in favor of economic diversification, they are always welcome,” he added.
Moreover, after the inauguration of the new government, Tai Kin IP, secretary for the economy and finance, made, in March, a visit to several European countries, leading a delegation that passed through Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Monaco to deepen “international links and explore opportunities for cooperation”, according to official information released at the time.
This approach to the Spanish -language universe, in addition to the usual connection already established between China and the Lusophone world, can have several origins: the growing relationship between China and Spain, as well as the desire to diversify the economy by MSAR, say analysts contacted by HM.
“The interpretation of Sam Hou Fai Declaration is very objective and pragmatic and can be summed up to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Portuguese-speaking countries. But the fact is that companies and institutions in Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in response to this need for Macao. For cooperation it seems logical to me, ”said economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, former resident of Macao and president of the Silk Route's New Friends Association (ARS).
According to the leader, “Macau is a pure market economy, is classified by the World Trade Organization as a free port with its own international agreements both in the economic, commercial, investment, financial, health, sports, sports, international relations agreements with various organizations. Therefore, the business in Macau is very free, and the part of the government of Macau is to promote and frame this opening”. "As Sam Hou Fai says, all companies and investors who bring Macao economy diversification solutions are welcome," he added.
To Cátia Miriam Costa, professor at ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon, and specialist in Chinese foreign policy and Macao, considered the HM that “this connection to the Spanish stems from the high -level official visits made by the Spanish government to China, that is, there is certainly one of the consequences of the repeated presence of Spanish diplomacy on a very high level, reinforcing the ties between the two. countries ”.
THE IMPORTANCE OF GLOBAL SOUTH
It is true that Beijing, in the words of President XI Jinping, has shown great interest in the approach of the countries of the so -called “global south”, where Portuguese and Spanish speaks, essentially. For Cátia Miriam Costa, here also resides another explanation for the change of paradigm in the field of commercial and economic cooperation.
"It seems to me that recent meetings with high Spanish political representatives have influenced this decision, along with China's increasing political investment in the global south where Portuguese and Spanish are, in fact, the most spoken languages."
For Académica, "the strategy of using Macau as a convergence point may be historically justified by its cosmopolitanism, but also by its traditional role in including the routes that connected Asia to Latin America." In addition, "adds to a historical perspective, a contemporary view for a region that needs economic diversification and benefits from this proximity to distant spaces, whether historical or culturally." Cátia Miriam Costa understands, therefore, that "Spanish can be seen as an additional value to Portuguese, without distorting the paradiplomacy strategy defined for Macao early on."
The inclusion of Equatorial Guinea in the Macao Forum cannot be ignored, as a result of its entry to the CPLP - community of Portuguese -speaking countries. However, Cátia Miriam Costa believes that this change has little or nothing to do with the inclusion of Spanish -speaking countries in the official commercial approach discourse.
"The inclusion of Equatorial Guinea in the Macao Forum stems from another circumstance, that of his participation as a member of the CPLP. In this sense, it was a logical step to its integration into the dynamics of the Forum. However and although it can count as a positive element in this approach, the leverage that Equatorial Guinea has in the Hispanic or Hispanic speaking world," he pointed out.
ASES BY ARE
Maria Fernanda Ilhéu also highlighted the fact that the only direct air connection between Macao and Europe will be for Madrid and not to Lisbon. “By chance, TAP or the Portuguese government have contacted Air Macau or the Macao government expressing interest in resuming this airline? I don't know, but I know that this connection will greatly contribute to strengthening the Spanish presence in Macao, whether in tourism, commerce or investment.”
The guardian highlights the complementarity factor of the air route. "Is the Portuguese and Spanish presence in Macau is incompatible? It doesn't look like, but it is competitive, it may even be beneficial if they know how to collaborate and gain scale in the Great Bay area, but Portugal has to strive more to their presence in Macau is not a historic relic."
Moreover, the economist does not forget the role that Portuguese foreign policy may play in this issue, with the removal of Huawei in Portugal and a closer approach to Beijing in recent times.
“Portugal's decision banning the use of Huawei equipment says mainly respect for the economic relations of Portugal with mainland China and it is framed by a fearful diplomatic relationship that the Portuguese government followed from 2019 to 2024, contrary to the Spanish diplomatic relationship. It should be noted that the Spanish Prime Minister visited China several times during this period and the Portuguese government alone was represented by the foreign business minister. At the Boao Forum in Hainan, with a brief pass for Beijing. ”
Thus, Maria Fernanda Ilhéu understands that between 2019 and 2024 “the Portuguese government and the Portuguese civil society were very conditioned by the American narrative of cold war and the formation of two antagonistic blocks, not knowing how to keep the line followed by 2019 to proceed with a relationship with China supported by the friendship and confidence of nearly 500 years of cooperation in Macau”.
The necessary work
For the economist and president of ANSRs, it is necessary to take into account the investments and business movements made in recent times to perceive the position of Portugal and Spain in this domain.
“The last major investment of a large Chinese company in Portugal was registered in 2020, and only now is this type of investment with Calb investment [SINE Battery producer] that is in the implementation and licensing phase. If we see the same type of investments in Spain from 2020 to 2024 we can record five major energy investments, by China Three Gorges and Huadian; Transport, Geely, Chery Auto and Envision Group; a major investment in agriculture by Yankuang Beijing Energy and also a major investment in the health sector by Worg Pharmaceuticals. ”
For the official, “a lot of work will have to be done by the new Portuguese government to develop Portuguese economic cooperation with mainland China and MSAR, but it will also have to be accompanied by Portuguese business fabric”, he summarized.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:17:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Physical Fitness | Study shows good results in preschool children</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/aptidao-fisica-estudo-mostra-bons-resultados-em-criancas-do-pre-escolar/</link><description>One study analyzed the physical fitness of preschool children in Macao. The results point to “modest growth and development”, “small increases in height and weight” and “improvements in speed, agility, muscle strength and flexibility”, thanks to the 2015 curriculum reform that bet on school sports
 
The government is to be congratulated with regard to sports in preschool, according to an academic study that evaluated children of kindergartens and statistical data of their physical fitness provided by the Institute of Sport (ID).
In "Temporal Trends of Physical Fitness in MSAR preschool children between 2002 and 2020", published in the Journal of Exercise &amp; Fitness, academics point to "modest growth and development among preschool students." Statistically evaluated parameters focus on performance in activities such as running, length jump or march. The work is by SIU Ming Choi, Faculty of Education, Grant R. Tomkinson, Justin J. Lang, Cristina Cadenas-Sanchez, Haoyu Dong, Si Man Lei, Eric Tsz Chun Poon, the latter linked to the Department of Sports Sciences and Physical Education at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
The authors have taken the annual ID data to realize how the children's body has evolved in recent years, allowing you to perceive data related to weight, height and body measurements. Thus, it is read that there were “small increases in height, weight and circumferences, improvements in speed-agility, muscle strength and flexibility of the lower body and flexibility, and declines in the muscle power of the upper body and equilibrium capacity”.
The study reveals "significant but small increases at the time, weight and circumference of the chest," while "the physical aptitude trends were contradictory, with declines ranging from insignificant to small throwing and equilibrium performance." There were also “insignificant improvements to small in other measures” of the body, with the authors to point out that “no significant differences were found between genres, which indicates equitable development” between boys and girls.
In general terms, “an increase in body size and modest but significant improvements in various components of physical fitness, such as speed-agility, muscle power, and flexibility, and flexibility, and declines elsewhere” have been registered.
The authors consider that these results “can be attributed to a combination of factors of the education system and the domestic environment”, as “the Macao Education System and the curriculum guidelines have given priority to the development of physical education and the acquisition of motor skills”.
It is also noteworthy that Macau was "the first region of China to incorporate kindergarten into its free education system since 2007, making the education of its residents a fundamental priority."
The study also mentions the 2015 curriculum reform, which “explicitly emphasizes learning fundamental movement skills, such as locomotor (walking, running, bouncing, equilibrium, trigger) and object control (launch, catch) through various physical activities and games designed by teachers”.
The work emphasizes the importance of guardians in the connection of children with sport, remembering the pandemic years. “Parents' positive influence on the modeling of physical activity can also play a role in these improvements, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when children had less opportunities for physical activity away from home.”
Academics emphasize that it is important, for the authorities, to make a “continuous monitoring” and “support the physical fitness and overall health in early childhood”, and there must be “strategies to improve global physical fitness in early childhood”.
Jump and jump
For this study, data from children between the age of three and the age of five were analyzed in preschool, in 2002, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020, such as body size, with regard to height, weight and circumferences of the chest, waist and hip; And physical fitness, such as the 2 × 10 m shot, foot length heel, marching, continuous two -legged heel, head throttle and sitting and reaching. ”
In addition, "preschool children of six macaoal gardens were recruited through a combination of stratified and group random sampling methods." A total of 4,519 children, with 59 percent boys and 41 percent girls participated.
The results reveal “an equitable improvement of physical fitness” and the data put Macau at a better position on some European countries referred to in the study. “In contrast to previous investigations into the trends of the physical development of children and adolescents in Poland, which revealed stability at the time, but increases in weight and body mass index, our results suggest that macao preschool children have increased in size, perhaps due to the best living and nutritional conditions.”
Academics conclude that "results are particularly significant," and point out that "the improvement observed in the performance of the standing length of the pre-school of Macau is encouraging."
Such "contrasts with the investigation into similar populations in the Czech Republic and Poland, where declines were reported in the performance in the length of standing length with increases in the body mass index and in the cutaneous fold," is indicated.
Other signs
The study also reveals “a temporal improvement of flexibility in Macao preschoolers, which differs from the trends observed in pole preschoolers”, and there are “cultural, environmental factors or other factors that influence the development of flexibility in young children in different regions and populations”.
The work also points out that the masters “mixtures uniquely mix eastern and western cultures, which turns it into an intriguing scenario to examine trends in the physical fitness of preschool children”. It is also noted that "the region has a strong commitment to education, offering 15 years of free preschool education to high school and secondary education, ensuring broad access to education and development programs in early childhood childhood for all children."
The compliments of the academics continue, stressing the “remarkable life expectancy, which exceeds 84 years in 2019”, and “Macao gave priority to their health and social systems”.
“Recognizing the importance of physical health, standardized and systematic physical fitness tests were performed on people of all ages since the beginning of the century, when the government implemented a physical fitness surveillance system aligned with China's national physical fitness monitoring,” is also explained.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 00:30:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Crime | “Illicit game” with an increase of more than 900 percent</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/28/criminalidade-jogo-ilicito-com-aumento-superior-a-900-por-cento/</link><description>The changes to the “Law on Combating Unlawful Game Crimes”, which added the crime of illegal exchange, led to more occurrences.

The law has changed and the crime increased. It was like this with the illegal exchange rate in casinos, as the activity began to be criminalized by the change to the “law to combat illicit gaming crimes” last year.
According to the balance of crime made yesterday, the crimes associated with the illicit game rose 906.3 percent, with 161 cases in the first quarter of this year compared to last year, growth enhanced by illegal exchange cases. The legislative change in question “led to a large increase of this type of crime, especially with regard to illegal exchange,” was mentioned.
In adding the crime of “illicit exchange exchange for game”, it was thus adjusted “the scope of coverage of some related crimes, resulting in the increase in crimes related to the illicit game”, it was added.
At yesterday's press conference, Secretary for Security, Wong Sio Chak, said that police authorities will continue to “reinforce the prevention and execution work of the law”, and follow “and analyze the development of crime”.
Exchanges and Baldrocas
In general terms, the game -associated crimes also increased, with 567 inquiries, 216 compared to the first quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 61.5 percent.
According to a press release of Wong Sio Chak's office, "it is believed that the main cause of this increase is related to the criminalization of" illegal money "," the dismantling of several relevant criminal networks in joint operations, as well as uncertain factors in society resulting from increased tourist.

Data released yesterday by the executive show how taxi drivers committed to increasing. In the first quarter of this year alone, 773 offenses were registered, with 660 being detected by agents of the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP).
According to the authorities, "more than half were situations in which taxi drivers did not wait for the order of customers in taxi squares."

At a time when they celebrate the 500th anniversary of the birth of the poet, Filipe de Saavedra, Academic of the Local University, speaks of the initiative and the Middle Middle Congress of the Birth of Luís de Camões, in Mozambique
 
Last year, 500 years were completed from the birth of the one who is considered the greatest Portuguese poet of all time. Luís de Camões, author of the epic “Os Lusíadas”, was born in 1524, sailed the seas and traveled lands where the Portuguese walked, namely Mozambique, Goa and Macao, among others, and on them left poems and writings in letters. Its importance is mirrored in the celebrations of June 10 - Portugal, Camões and the Portuguese Communities.
All the literary manifestations that Camões has left written will now be translated into Chinese thanks to a project that has been developed by the University of Science and Technology of Macao (Must, English acronym). Filipe de Saavedra, specialist in the life and work of Luís de Camões, professor and researcher at this University and PhD in Portuguese Studies, spoke to HM about the project.
“Our translations will come out of a project ongoing at UCTM [Must in the Acronym in English] where the full translation of Chinese of all lyrical genres and letters of Camões is foreseen. Students have been exposed to the poet from the first year of the degree in Portuguese studies to the master's degree, and their response is enthusiastic. Macao '. We had already had the same success with the Indonesian students.
"The most ambitious project is that of the critical edition of the work, which we are starting with letters and odes. It will combine the accumulated efforts of various generations of scholars with our new readings of the manuscripts, and new interpretations. It will be the most lasting and most necessary contribution by these celebrations," added the Camonist.
Must also has the theater studio project in which “students represent Camões”, and this year's poetry contest, students chose to recite Camões, demonstrating great sensitivity to his poetry ”. For Filipe de Saavedra, "the seed is launched, and from there will come the translators and camons of the future."
Given Macau's strong connection in the life of Luís de Camões, the territory welcomed the “I Congress of Middle Millennium”, representing academics from various countries with studies around the figure, work and life of Luís de Camões.
The balance made by Filipe de Saavedra is quite positive. “We have already brought three times the master-transtor Zhang Weimin, always with the support of the Oriente Foundation, which gave several master classes on how to translate Camões into Mandarin to UCTM's most advanced courses.”
In this context, Must has established "protocols with foreign universities where there are Camonian centers for common initiatives." One of the most recent was with Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique to hold the second edition of the same Congress next June, Maputo and the Island.
Camões in Mozambique
According to Philip de Saavedra, "Congress takes place on special days for Camões, and in places he dwelt: February 25, the most likely date of his birth and March 12, the date of the publication of the epic; and now June 10, the poet's death day in Lisbon."
"As Camões lived two years on the island of Mozambique, late or early we would go. Congresses had already been held about Camões in Portugal and Brazil, but this is the first that gathers throughout Africa, and in Asia we also did two, one in Indonesia and one in Macao, the first on this continent," he explained.
In Mozambique, the professor will talk about “about Africans in general [present] in the work of Camões”, and other academics will “take care of his relationship with Mozambique, with other people who have passed through the time he was there, of translation issues that are always primal, and the teaching of Camões in schools”. According to the Academic, this Congress has the support of the Portuguese National Commission for the celebrations of the V Centenary of Camões.
Filipe de Saavedra is also part of the “Camões Network in Asia &amp; Africa”, which brings together several experts in Camões and has organized the Middle Millennium Congresses. "The chamonism network we have implemented in Asia will be true to its translating meeting point matrix with exegetes. It is characterized by a global and plural perspective, centered on texts, but anchoring equally on the vital experience of the poet, specifically in his Asian and African experiences. This is a different point of view from that of Portugal."
The III Middle Millennium Congress will take place next year in Goa, in partnership with the University of Goa. "We will deepen the relations of Camões with India of that time, and not only with Portuguese India. We are offering co-inmates to Indian students of Master and PhD who want to work Camões, as well as bibliographic assistance. We will also invest in the search for new translators of Camões poetry for the various Indian languages," he said.
Missing writings
Asked what the poet's work is to be analyzed and investigated, the Must researcher highlights the few advances at the level of the work, and more in the biographical aspect. “In the twentieth century, and in what goes from the 21st, it has advanced above all in the knowledge of Camões's life. But as for the work, progress has been slower. Despite the fundamental contributions provided by Portuguese and foreign scholars, it can be said that no lyric editions are still up to its whole as definitive, and the same as those of theater.
Philip de Saavedra points out that "a lot is done and a lot is to do," but as far as the poet's hectic life is concerned, "there are many aspects of Camões's life where we even know too much, on matters that he might have not liked to know so much."
"Even the study of the lyric would already be an abuse for him, since he did not want to gather or publish, when he could easily have done it after the success of" Os Lusíadas ". It was a renegade part of his work, not to mention the private letters, some very private. Therefore all this excess of knowledge, this one knows almost everything about life and about the work of Camões, represents for us a miracle, and for him," he added.
For Philip de Saavedra, "the distressing dilemma between respecting the will and privacy of an author, and pending to the intimate recesses his earthly existence, even probing his most intimate thoughts." "Here we are forced to weigh the interest of the individual on the one hand, ideally assistance, and the interest of culture and history by the other, which is greater and sovereign. It wins the second, and that Camões forgive us," he concludes.</description><pubDate>2025-05-27 22:56:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Zone A | Open public tender for five commercial spaces</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/05/zona-a-aberto-concurso-publico-para-cinco-espacos-comerciais/</link><description>The Housing Institute (IH) is holding a public tender for the granting of five commercial spaces in the public housing venture in zone A of the new landfills, namely for restaurants, a banking unit or a pharmacy, and four spaces are located in the Tong Chong building and the other in the Tong Kai building, both on the Avenida do Mar de Mirror, in the new landfills.

In his oral interpellation, Ron Lam U Tou argued that, for example, provisional wastewater treatment facilities on Marginal Avenue of Lam Mau and provisional wastewater treatment facilities in the outer port did not take place according to the Urban Planning Law. This in the sense that before the works were executed was not requested a plant of Urban Conditions (PCU), nor issued the public notice regarding the projects. Nor were public opinions collected according to the legislation.
Thus, the deputy questions whether unified criteria can be created for the procedures in public works. In addition, since Macao has a new jurisdiction for the management of new maritime areas, there are increasing construction projects related to this zone that are not covered by previously elaborated PCU, not even public consultation.
Therefore, the deputy wants to know if the government can comply with the public consultation mechanism provided for in the Urban Planning Law, so that the public's right is respected to know the contours of the projects and give opinions about their content.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:26:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Traffic | Deputies prepare increased fines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/transito-deputados-preparam-aumento-de-multas/</link><description>With the entry into force of the amendments to the Traffic Law that are being discussed in the Legislative Assembly, several fines for smaller offenses will become more expensive. The scenario was drawn yesterday by Ella Lei, president of the 1st Permanent Commission of the Legislative Assembly, which is discussing changes in the specialty.
According to the deputy, cited by the newspaper or Mun, if a vehicle does not respect the safety distance, the fine will increase from 600 patacas to 900 patacas, a difference of 300 patacas.
An increase of 300 patacas will also be applied to situations where conductors use sound signals without justification. In these situations, the fine will move to 600 patacas, when it is currently 300 patacas. In this case, the deputy indicates that the changes to the law will also clarify the situations where instead of resorting to the beeps, drivers should use the light signs.
At the same time, the text of the law will indicate that vehicle drivers have to slow down when circulating in places such as gas stations, access to parking lots or residence zones.
The new law will also define that when a vehicle circulates at a too slow speed, with traffic disturbance, the penalty rises to 600 patacas, when it is currently 300 patacas. Although there is no minimum speed, Ella Lei said the police will apply this type of fines based on concrete situations.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:22:48</pubDate></item><item><title>AL | Family conciliation law ready to be voted</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/al-lei-conciliacao-familiar-pronta-para-ser-votada/</link><description>The 3rd Permanent Commission of the Legislative Assembly (AL) ended the analysis of the proposal of the conciliation regime for family causes, which should be voted in the coming days in the specialty. The government proposed by the government aims to create a mechanism to prevent courts in case of disputes resulting from divorce, exercise of paternal power, food provision or issues related to the family home.
According to the proposal, before resolving the issues through the courts, citizens must first resort to a pre-mediation system integrated at the Institute of Social Action (IAS).
The mediators are made available by IAS, which, according to Deputy Vong Hin Fai, chairman of the commission, will give training about 200 workers. The government is prepared for the proposal to take effect at the beginning of next year, and Vong said the preparation will not imply an increase in the current budget.
According to the newspaper or Mun, also president of the Macao Lawyers Association indicated that the deputies proposed to the government that the 49 Macao mediators recognized to exercise mediation within the Great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay, many of which lawyers could perform the mediation functions in this process. However, the government has refused the proposal because it considered that these mediators are mainly prepared to resolve commercial disputes.
The statistics pointed out by the government to the committee indicate that every year there have been about 1,000 cases of family disputes to enter the courts of Macao. Among these cases, 200 will have to go through the pre-mediation process.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:20:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Health | Zhong Nanshan continues to lead expert commission</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/saude-zhong-nanshan-continua-a-liderar-comissao-de-especialistas/</link><description>Chinese epidemiologist and pulmonologist, who has become known worldwide during the pandemic, will continue to preside over to the Specialist and Advisory Commission for the appreciation of traditional Chinese drugs for another three years
 
Epidemiologist and pulmonologist Zhong Nanshan will continue for another three years to preside over to the Commission of Experts and Advisers for the appreciation of traditional Chinese drugs.
The renewal of the appointment of one of China's most media figures during the pandemic and the implementation of the zero policy of COVID-19 was published yesterday in the official bulletin. The decision was made by the secretary for social and cultural affairs, LAM, and will come into force on June 23.
The Specialized Commission has as its functions the authorization, renewal, change, suspension and cancellation of the registration of traditional Chinese drugs and evaluation of quality, effectiveness and safety of these same medicines. The opinions are issued at the request of the Institute for Pharmaceutical Supervision and Administration (Isaf).
The renewal of the appointment is not a surprise, since Zhong Nanshan only fulfilled a mandate as president, which is renewable.
In addition, in February this year, about two months after the executive's head of the Chief Executive, the interior doctor of China was received by Sam Hou Fai at the Government's headquarters, as a member of the Chinese Engineering Academy, director of the Guangzhou Laboratory, and chairman of the Guidance Commission of the Macao Translational Medicine and Innovation Institute.
Also in 2020, due to the role of consultant from the Macao government during the pandemic period, Zhong Nanshan received the Honor Sente Great Lotus Medal.
New appointment
Regarding the other members of the Commission, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, chose not to make major modifications. Zeng Li, Rector of the School of Medicine, Macao University of Science and Technology (Must) becomes part of the 17 members of the commission. Li will replace Michael Yao Specialist in Chinese and Academic Medicine that was also linked to Must. The reasons for the substitution were not advanced.
The other experts appointed are Liu Liang, Yang Changming, Han Wei, Wang Yitao, Zhang Law, Yang Zifeng, Du Shouying, Ji Shen, Zhou Hua, Chen Xin, Li Shaoping, Lee Ming Yuen, Yan Ru, Li Jun and Mo Hui.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:19:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Tim Wong presented yesterday application</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/eleicoes-tim-wong-apresentou-ontem-propositura-de-candidatura/</link><description>For now, it seems that the next legislative elections will have a new list head. Tim Wong, who directs the Macao and Myanmar Friendship Association and founded the Association of the Promotion of Citizens and Economics, presented yesterday the request for the Constitution of the Application Commission to the Electoral Affairs Committee of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal).
The list presented yesterday, composed of local and foreign residents of Macao, began to be thought of two years ago and was now handed over to Caeal the request for the constitution of a commission, signed by 500 residents.
Among the issues that move the candidacy, the list head highlights as a priority the support for the subsistence of the most disadvantaged groups, the quality of life of the population and the survival of small and medium enterprises.
Although Tim Wong shared opinions on various topics on social networks, and even delivered a petition to the government to reducing non-resident workers, the list does not yet have a complete political program, but is being prepared, yesterday guaranteed the potential candidate in statements after submitting the application for application.
After a career in the civil service, Tim Wong returned to university to do his doctorate and, in 2014, moved to the private sector and social services. The associative leader understands that, nowadays, there are not in the Legislative Assembly voices that represent the vulnerable groups of society.
In this regard, the potential candidate for deputy mentioned the changes to the rules of attribution of pecuniary checks, criticizing the fact that there was no public consultation, not a period of transition to the changes.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:41:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | RON LAM DELIVERS APPLICATION APPLICATION, WITHOUT LIST</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/eleicoes-ron-lam-entrega-pedido-de-candidatura-ainda-sem-lista/</link><description>Macau synergy delivered yesterday the request for the constitution of candidacy for the legislatures. Without confirming if it will be a list head, Ron Lam said he wants to continue to be a bridge between the government and the population. About his first term, Ron Lam confessed to feeling powerless, despite the effort to demonstrate his opinions
 
The Macau Synergy Association yesterday handed over to the Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) the request for the constitution of the Candidacy Commission for Legislative Elections. The Association led by President Johnson Ian and Vice-President and Deputy Ron Lam also handed over about four hundreds of signatures to support the candidacy.
Despite confessing that I would like to continue to give voice to the population, for the association of Macau synergy, it does not have a list formed, a fact that Ron Lam justified with limited resources and lack of time. "Regarding who will be the head of the list, our team will still argue, but I believe there are those who want me to keep my place in Hemiciclo. But it is important to obey the team's decision," he said.
Regarding his first term of deputy, who is about to end, Ron Lam confessed some frustration between commitment, his expectations and how they were not reflected in political reality. "I applied myself to legislative work with effort, participated in all meetings and expressed my opinions, but the results did not correspond to what I expected," he said.
To the other bank
Speaking in the public administration building, Ron Lam defended the importance of making the government the different opinions of the population, the mission that the deputy and potential candidate admits to want to continue to perform.
In fact, public opinion perceived by the deputy and the suggestions that result from public consultations of the executive continue to present major discrepancies. Ron Lam argues that these differences make governance not correspond to the wishes and expectations of the population for social development.
"We hope to continue effectively the role of bridge between society and the government, reflecting the opinions of the population. We also hope that the executive will decide more political, seriously and humble, in accordance with popular will," said Ron Lam.
The deputy gave as an example of situations in which the executive turned back after public opinions, which gave voice, the suspension of the works that would erect a giant statue of the goddess Kun iam in Coloane. "Although we can often not do better, in others we get the authorities to follow the way we point out."
The same was not true of changes to the form of attribution of the pecuniary check, where Ron Lam claims to have lacking communication between the government and society, not even through public consultation.
Caeal | Bom Lar Alliance Delivery
The Good Lar Alliance yesterday handed over to the Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) the request for the constitution of the Candidacy Commission, with 500 signatures. According to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, the agent of the Bom Lar Alliance Candidacy Commission is Iong Weng Ian, who is also president of the Fiscal Council of the General Association of Macao Women.
According to the presentation, the Good Home Alliance intends to fight for an improvement in the rights of women and children, and in a second phase, will listen to and collect social opinions to elaborate the political program and organize the list of candidates to the next elections for the Legislative Assembly.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>The meteorological systems of early alert and their importance</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/os-sistemas-meteorologicos-de-alerta-precoce-e-a-sua-importancia/</link><description>Olavo Rasquinho *
General knowledge is the importance that weather warnings have for human activities. However, about a third of the 193 members of the World Meteorological Organization (MMO) do not yet have efficient early warning systems to warn populations to be careful against the loss of lives and goods before natural meteorological disasters.
In the face of this reality, OMM selected for the theme of the 2025 World Meteorological Day celebrations (DMM) “Closing the Early Warning Gap Together”, which can be translated by “We reduce the failures of early alert systems together”. The theme is part of the “Early Warly Warnings for All Initiative”), which aims to protect the global scale, relative to hazardous hydrometeorological, climate and related environmental events.
Early alert systems are essentially based on four components: knowledge of risk; Monitoring and forecasting; communication and dissemination of alerts and response capacity of the communities. The failure of any of these components compromises the effectiveness of measures to be taken to prevent a natural disaster from becoming a catastrophe.
Meteorological services, using means of a global observation network, and physical-mathematical models that simulate the behavior of the atmosphere, predict the occurrence of phenomena that may affect the lives of citizens. For example, the approximate time of the arrival of a typhoon the earth may be foreseen, but the simple fact that your movement slows or accelerates may result in not getting it right when it happens. Usually the typhoons, which always form at sea, decrease the speed of progression and intensity as they approach land.
However, sporadically, this may not happen. This is what happened with Typhoon Hato who, in August 2017, hit Macao with serious consequences. Instead of decreasing its displacement speed and weakening, it suffered sudden intensification and increased speed, surprising meteorologists. This happened with the aggravation of the arrival of the typhoon coincided with the high astronomical tide, which reinforced the consequences of the storm tide. It can then be deduced that the “monitoring and prediction” component and, consequently, the component “communication and spread of alerts” of the early alert system did not function a hundred percent due to the anommal behavior of the typhoon.
This happened on a territory where the early alert system is well structured and usually works with a high success rate. Imagine what may happen when this type of phenomena occurs in regions where there are no early warning systems or, therefore, are not effective enough due to deficiency in means or lack of human resources. As an example of this situation one can mention what happened in November 1970, in the so-called East Pakistan. This Pakistani province was hit by one of the most violent cyclones of the last century, the “Great Bhola Cyclone”, which caused a number of dead that is estimated between three hundred thousand at half a million.
It is considered the tropical cyclone that has caused the most victims since there are records. Winds of about 200 km/h, coincident with a high astronomical tide, dragged the waters of the Indian Earth-to-Dentro, invading much of the Ganges River delta, causing a large storm tide that reached 6 meters. The consequences were so serious that they contributed to the people's revolt, motivated by the weak response of the central government. The discontent generated contributed to intensify the struggle for the independence of the province, which was materialized in 1971, giving rise to a new country, Bangladeche.
Another example was what happened in Myanmar (former Burma) in May 2008. This country, directed for tens of years by military dictatorships, would not suffer so much the consequences of the Camis Cyclone if they were attached with a modern and efficient alert system. The more than 130,000 deadly victims caused by the storm tide associated with the tropical cyclone would certainly be largely avoided. A few days before the cyclone hit that country had already been issued by the Specialized Regional Meteorological Center (“Regional Specialized Meteorological Center - RSMC”), which is the center responsible for the Meteorological Surveillance for the Indian Norte Basin1.
Also the meteorological service of India warned the government of Myanmar about the high probability of occurrence of a large storm tide that would affect the Irauádi River Delta, which happened about 48 hours later, enough time to evacuate the populations.
In the case of Bhola and Nargis cyclones the alert systems were practically nonexistent in East Pakistan and Myanmar. However, in the Philippines, an average affected country, on average, by about twenty tropical storms and typhoons, although the meteorological and civil protection authorities were considered well organized, failures occurred in two of the components of the early alert system in November 2013.
The components “Knowledge of Risk” and “Communication and Dissemination of Alerts” failed partly due to outdated flood risk maps and inadequate language used. Typhoon Haiyan (designated in the Philippines by Yolanda Superirty) caused a number of deadly victims of more than six thousand. The main reasons for the catastrophe to have reached such proportions were, in addition to the failures of two of the components of the early alert system, in the facts that the pressure was extremely low in the center (about 895 HPa), winds of great intensity and the typhoon had entered the land near the tide tide tide. These conjugated factors caused a storm tide that reached, in some places between 6 and 7 meters. Note that the decrease in pressure of 1 hPa corresponds to the elevation of the sea level of about 1 cm.

Friedrich Nietzsche
The project centered on artificial intelligence (AI) announced by Trump redefines the silicon valley hierarchies. And clarifies the industrial nature of AI. Since winning the elections, Donald Trump has spent a long time to talk about the stars. In the beginning was Musk, the famous «Nascent Astro», on the occasion of the first speech of the tycoon after the electoral victory. Subsequently, still linked to Elon, it was the turn of Mars, the red star and where to plant the star flag to update the manifest fate of such an exceptional people that it must become transglobal. And then, like a blue sky radius, the time has come for Stargate, the "door of the stars" with which Trump intends to relaunch the American dream, linking it to technological innovation and AI development, with the concrete objective of preserving world leadership.
The United States must maintain technological superiority from China that recently developed an AI (Deepseek) model capable of achieving chatgpt results with lower level hardware (according to them) and lower costs because only then Washington can establish with Beijing a "agreement" which is Trump's new word from a force position. Stargate is a potentially revolutionary project. It is about investing a hundred billion dollars immediately, intended to quintuple, to accelerate the development of the new generation of artificial intelligences, integrating the material production chain (data centers and chips) with the intangible (cloud computer management and algorithm writing). To do so, Trump trusts those elements of the technological world that, until yesterday, were far from the spotlight.
And sanction the end of those who, within the state, were occupied exactly with these issues. In short, the “Paypal Mafia” in its thielist and muskian currents will be out of the star door, occupying the antechamber in the company of Eric Schmidt, a former Google Democrat who presides over the (expensive) national security committee, now totally empty meaning. Trump's decision is clear. Like a new Adam Smith, the tycoon proposes a division of labor necessary so that none of the great men in the technological sector can accumulate too much power. There are no stars so brilliant that they can overshadow that of the president, which applies the most classic of divide et reepe. Will it work? To understand, we have to cross the door of the stars. When, last January 21, Trump appeared at the White House to announce the launch of Stargate, there were three people with him.
Less known than Elon Musk, often in disagreement with Tesla's founder and eager for showing the world as they can also be useful to the tycoon. After the president, the first to speak was Larry Ellison, co-founder and executive president of Oracle. Your company works with cloud, that is, it stores huge amounts of data for various technological companies. The eighty -year -old entrepreneur, against the president of his age, explains how AI can be useful for health. Your speech looks like an advertising announcement. But beware of appearances. Ellison theorizes the use of AI to implement a total surveillance system, necessary for "citizens to behave correctly." The president of Oracle is the only one who has not formally a role in organizing Stargate, but Trump introduced him as "CEO of everything" and also made it clear that he would be happy if they bought Tiktok.
Trump and Ellison are from the same generation, both are New Yorkers and have known each other for a long time. Probably understand each other very well. Then I intervened Masayoshi Son, known as Masa. He is the founder, representative director, corporate executive, chairman of the board and CEO of Softbank Group (SBG), a Japanese group of risk capital, and will be the financial responsible of Stargate. The task of bringing the capitalization of the star door to five hundred billion of dollars is, first of all, yours. But above all, as a good Japanese, Masa knows that the project was born with an antichinese function that "this is not just a business", making a point of specifying. It is about developing AI so as not to lose the race for innovation with China. And perhaps also create a container to promote the development of ARM, the English company that sells AI chips and that appears as the flagship of Softbank's investments. Last but not least, Sam Altman.
In November 2023, after the case that shook OpenAi's foundations due to its dismissal (later withdrawal), the state entered its company. Informally. But the presence of a figure like Larry Summers, a former treasure secretary and very close to national security devices on the ChatgPT mother's council council clearly shows how the government wanted to be aware of its internal dynamics.
Today, just over a year later, it is Altman who binds to the state. The founder of OpenAi will in fact play Stargate's role of operational responsible. And it has already obtained an important result, since Microsoft to which OpenAI is linked by a contract by 2030 granted Altman's company the ability to also use its competitors' cloud services for this project. In particular, obviously, those of Larry Ellison, CEO of everything.
The main actors are joined by Microsoft itself that will provide its stargate cloud platform and obviously NVIDIA. Because there is no GPU (Graphic Processing Units) to train the Machine Learning models. Jensen Huang's Nvidia is still, in fact, practically monopolistic in the sector, although the market is expanding and is increasingly difficult to meet demand. Finally, the United Arab Emirates Fund (MGX) specializing in technological investments will collaborate in the financial management of the operation. And so, almost as in a joke, Stargate is, in the end, a container in which a Bronx -born octogenarian, a sixty -year -old Japanese, a young AI guru, Microsoft, Jensen Huang with his leather coat and an Abu Dhabi background.
Trump's task will be to coordinate this heterogeneous human mass, joining it around a strategic goal of developing AI to reprogram the American dream and keep China a safe distance. All clear. How to proceed?

Secondly, come the Luxembourg, with an average active of 607,500 dollars. Hong Kongers are third, with an average active of $ 582,000, equivalent to about 4.54 million dollars from Hong Kong.
"Wealth" includes personal and other active income after debt, also designated by "net value".
The report also points out that the percentage of millionaires in Hong Kong is about 10 percent, ie out of ten adult residents of Hong Kong one is a millionaire. The report provides that Hong Kong in 2028 will be 17.3 percent of millionaires.
In the “ranking of the richest regions in the world in 2024”, another report published by the financial magazine “Forbes”, Luxembourg appears first with a GDP of $ 143,740, Macao ranks second with a GDP of $ 1340s and Hong Kong qualifies in 15th place with a $ 75,130 US GDP.
Two different financial reports show the financial situation of Hong Kong and Macao and there are several points worth mentioning:
First, Hong Kong millionaires represent about 10 percent of the population and Macau's GDP emerges as the second tallest in the world. These data indicate the strength of the two administrative regions and their impressive achievements under the principle "one country, two systems."
Second, Macao presents a per capita GDP of 134,140 USD. As we all know, Macau's main source of revenue comes from the game and this number reflects the sector's contribution to the city's economy.
The game sector brings considerable income to Macau, but also includes hidden dangers. Although the pandemic has already ended, the economy has not fully recovered and the game's recipes have decreased, which inevitably affects people's livelihood. Macao's economy should be moderately diversified and its dependence on the game sector should decrease in order to improve everyone's lives.
Third, Hong Kong's per capita GDP is 75,130 USD. Unlike Macao, Hong Kong has no industries that generate great recipes. If Hong Kong wants to improve its classification, it has to create industries that bring more recipes to the city.
Fourth, the average active of Hong Kong millionaires are about 582,000 USD. Hong Kong's most valuable assets are known to be related to real estate. If an active of a millionaire include a home, but if this home is their housing, then this property represents only a facial value. If the house is sold, it gets a lot of money, but needs to buy another house to live. Therefore, the financial effect of this type of assets is limited.
Wealth brings security and is a source of pride to everyone. Both financial reports demonstrate the financial stability of the two special administrative regions. However, as the economy has not completely recovered after the pandemic, people should be more careful in managing their finances and giving their best to enjoy the pleasure that wealth brings.

Imagine a civil servant to win in one day 51,000 euros. Impossible? No. It happened at the Santa Maria hospital in Lisbon with our money. A dermatologist and other elements of your team have gained 850,000 euros on just 10 Saturdays. Only the doctor in question has gained 450 thousand euros in 10 days. How was it possible? It is under investigation because it is a scandalous fraud.
At stake is the so -called Sigic, the integrated surgery management system for surgery, a system that allows you to have surgeries outside work hours to mitigate long waiting lines in hospitals. If on the one hand, productivity increases and diminishes waiting lists, on the other, it is a financial incentive for health professionals, given that they receive money for it. Now, for doctors to have surgeries over the weekend, they have to meet a goal. There must be a maximum limit of sense not to exceed one third of the total surgical production. Each of those interested in participating in Sigic in 2024 should produce regular surgery registered as such in a system in the estimated proportion of 3: 1. That is, it would be necessary to perform 66 outpatient surgeries to be able to do a day of Segic with 22 patients. The minimum allowed proportion is 2: 1.
Dermatologist Miguel Alpalhão headed a team with more colleagues and a nurse. The case is giving to talk every day in the press and television channels. The hospital's managing president himself said he had been a stunted, but has been publicly public that hospital management was already aware of what had happened a few months ago. "It is not possible that five -hour surgery pay about 900 euros and there are then doctors to earn more than three thousand euros for taking a signal," a Santa Maria professional vented to Saturday magazine.
The biggest problem is that the case of Miguel Alpalhão may be particular in the magnitude of the values ​​involved, but it seems that there are other public hospitals - and more medical specialties, as well as dermatology - where financial incentives under Sigic, to operate for regular working hours, have no control. A manager with knowledge of what is happening in the specialty of ophthalmology said that there are ophthalmologists to do dozens of simple interventions to catarats on Saturdays and Sundays, who gain tens of thousands of euros. And in this case, the scandal will be very serious in the history of the National Health Service completely paid by the State Budget, which means money spent belonging to all Portuguese.
But the whole currency has two faces. Imagine that in a case where you already talk about the expulsion of the doctor Miguel Alpalhão, he went to the medical course because when he was young had a disease for which there was no clinical explanation. In 2016 it was the best of his year to leave the Lisbon Medical School.
He chose dermatology because he wanted a good life. Those who worked with him describe him as “a Dr. House” with a unique visual memory. The 400,000 euros he received for ten Saturdays at the Santa Maria hospital did not drag him just for a scandal - they put on the radar the financial surgeries of the surgeries in the NHS outside the regular time. As a 24 -year -old man won the Professor Manuel Machado Macedo award for graduating with the best grade of his year at the Lisbon School of Medicine.
A doctor who worked with him describes the dermatologist, whom he met when he passed as an internal (holder of a paid internship) at his service in Santa Maria, as “a Dr. House”, in reference to the character in the fictional series, which has a sometimes less common deal and an innate talent for diagnoses. “It has a unique visual memory, made diagnoses that no one else did in the internship,” says his teacher. There were older doctors to ask him doubts about more pussy cases, something unusual in the middle. "It has a bright head," said the same teacher.
It was, like so many other doctors-whose post-university formation is largely sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry-in the radar of some laboratories (in all received 23,422 euros in six years, according to the Transparency Portal, almost everything paid in kind-travel, congresses and the like). He is an assistant professor at the college where he graduated, according to his profile on the CUF website (where he is also listed as a clinician at the Discoveries Hospital in Lisbon and in another in Torres Vedras).
However, the prosecutor has already opened an inquiry into everything that happened with doctor Miguel Alpalhão and his team in Santa Maria. However, we can not fail to refer to the statements of the Minister of Health that came to say that the case "is very serious" and that "an investigation has already begun."
But does anyone believe that a minister has the competence to hold a position of vital importance such as health and knew nothing of what was going on in various hospitals in the country?
With cases of this nature and with what came to light also last week about corruption of other civil servants in the Air Force, who were already notified as defendants of suspicion of active and passive corruption in the acquisition of helicopters injuring the state (all of us) in about 200 million euros, how can we admire that André Ventura's party has increased his vote with the Portuguese?</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 01:36:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Exhibition | Local artist Cheong Kin Man presents new show in Lisbon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/exposicao-artista-local-cheong-kin-man-apresenta-nova-mostra-em-lisboa/</link><description>It is a creative path with several locations that Cheong Kin Man and Marta Sala perform in Lisbon from tomorrow: first, the show “The Slazing and Curious Travel”, to see at the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center until July 6, whose launch is preceded by a conversation with artists and a book release.

For several years based in Berlin, Cheong Kin Man has been a visual artist and anthropologist who has never left experimentation aside. Now, alongside the Polish artist Marta Sala, has been embedded in new artistic directions, which, this time, flow into Lisbon.
This happens in multiple forms. First with the show “The Slazing and Curious Travel”, which will be evident at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) between tomorrow and July 6. Curated by Lorena Tabares Salamanca, from Colombia, the show is a “cross -cultural exposure that crosses art, visual anthropology and personal archives, reflecting on displacements, memory and languages”, with the signature of Cheong Kin Man, Marta Sale and Deborah Uhde from Germany.
The public can see “immersive installations, textile pieces, video and self-ethnographs that reconfigure the relations between travel, history and knowledge,” says a press release of the Poland City Council. In the inaugural session of this Thursday there will also be a conversation with the artists, which is repeated on Friday, but this time at the Goethe Institute library in Lisbon at 18h.
Here, in “Creating Connections”, a conversation with the three artists of “The Slazing and Curious Travel”, which is “an intimate artistic meeting, in which Deborah Uhde, as well as the duo Marta Stanisława Sala and Cheong Kin Man, will share among themselves-and with the public-reflections on their practices and experiences in creating intercultural bonds through art, especially art, with emphasis on art. their paths in Berlin and the latest artist books. ”
These initiatives are supported by the Poland Embassy in Portugal, the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage and the Adam Mickiewicz Institute of Poland. They also have the partnership of the City Council of Krakow and the Boym Institute, also from Poland.
Fusions and Travel
The show that now presents at CCCM brings works of the duo Cheong Kin Man - Marta Sala, known “by the fusion of fabric, video and language experiments”, in which the public can “embark on a trip through parallel worlds and personal files” based on three multimedia projects, such as “The Utopian's compass”, “Revelations” and a new cycle of Macaense diaspora.
In the case of “The Utopia Compass”, it is a “bamboo and fabric installation composed of 13 textile compositions that materialize processes of cultural discovery and mutual learning”, and the work is inspired by the “Flora Sinensis” (1656), by the Jesuit Miguel Boym, who studied in Krakow; as well as “in the musicality of Cantonense poetry translated into chromatic shapes and in self-ethrical motifs associated with the migration of a Macaense family and the contemporary trips of the artists”.
In turn, the “Revelation” series, presented for the first time at the Macao Biennial in 2023, “combines text, textiles and video in a science fiction narrative”, and the fabric “which integrates this fiction coding episodes of the Polish family archive, including migration through the borders of the twentieth century - from Vilnius to the Mongolian steppes and, later, to current Poland”.
Also noteworthy is that the exhibition reveals “the experimental film project based on interviews within the Macaense Diaspora”, taking the public to Brazil, “where the nostalgia shared by humanity echoes in automatic translations for various languages”. There are also, associated with the video, the new publication entitled “Entrevista, MięDzy-Wizje. Roz-Mowa, disorder”, which is “in the form of Flipbook with Luso-Polaco glossary, which deconstructs an excerpt from the recording to reflect on each word said and the limits and possibilities of translation”. This Thursday's CCCM session begins with a guided tour of the artists at 5 pm, including the launch of "Revelation", a new book by artists.

The Portuguese Bookstore welcomes a new exhibition tomorrow. This is “small worlds in solid state”, by Claudia Falcão, a conservation and restoration specialist who for the first time debuts with a project in the field of fine arts. The show can be seen until June 28th and is integrated into the official poster of the June 10th - Portugal, Camões and the Portuguese Communities celebrations.
According to the exhibition catalog, “small worlds in solid state” appears to the public as a “journey through memories and visual narratives in solid state, images crystallized in small worlds, worlds that result from what surrounds us, worlds we carry, worlds we build, worlds we share”.
Thus, “object photographs will be displayed, in which the image arises influenced by the morphology of stone, its color, textures and imperfections”, with references to the Portuguese sidewalk, which has become “emblematic” in the territory and is “one of the most recognized symbols in Portugal”.
“If the great art invites an immersive experience, the very small requires approximation and a close look at the discovery of what hides in detail. In both cases, there is a sharing of the artist's vision and, at the same time, we are invited to dive into our own unique universe, which is unique,” ​​is also described in the same catalog.
Sidewalk Images
This show is born from the Sølid project, described as "Claudia Falcão's first adventure on the creative side of the fine arts after many years across the art, as a conservative-restoration."
It is a “project that mirrors its experiences, its gaze and its aesthetic sensitivity, and naturally underlies concern for the preservation, not only of artistic and cultural heritage, but also of the visual memories, of more personal caress, which it collects”.
In the Portuguese Bookstore, the public can see works whose base is photography and a support made with sidewalk stones, in white limestone. “In this support, photography arises subtly transformed by its own shape, texture and color of the used stone and each piece becomes unique,” ​​is described.
The Sølid project is “entirely dedicated to Macao” and “was born of the desire to celebrate the cultural diversity of this special city and the bonds that unite it to Portugal”. “In a not sleeping city, like Macau, in a city that changes so quickly, crystallizing a moment on a stone turns out to be a symbolic act of honoring the memory of the instant and capturing the time passing voracious,” reads in the same catalog.
At HM, Claudia Falcão also said that Macau "fascinates her for much familiar and for what is different." "As a Portuguese artist, my gaze will always be a look that has this filter of Portuguese, a filter that is feeling and is culture, it does and will always do part of my identity, my way of seeing and feeling the world and expressing myself and I believe this will be very notorious in this exhibition," he said.
“Although we are on the other side of the world, we still find Borders of Portugal in Macau, daily, in particular in some architectural elements and milestones, such as the sidewalk, which being so Portuguese, is also part of the identity of Macao. In this particular exhibition, taking into account the context of the celebration of June 10, Portugal and Macao emerge through six series of images that celebrate this strong bond, but also their differences and their differences and their differences. Singularities, ”he said.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:54:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Burlas | More than 1,800 detainees in extended Asian operation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/burlas-mais-de-1-800-detidos-em-operacao-asiatica-alargada/</link><description>More than 1,800 people were detained in an operation against networks dedicated to Asian -mounted mounted mounted mocked mesh, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Maldives. In Macao, the Judiciary Police revealed the detention of nine suspects, who will have missed 84 victims in about 4 million Patacas
 
An operation, which crossed seven jurisdictions in Asia, resulted in the detention of 1,858 people linked to fraud and burlans networks. The operation, which involved authorities from Hong Kong, Macao, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Maldives, intercepted funds from Hong Kong's $ 150 million $ 150 million schemes, Hong Kong Police Crimes Department, Wong Chun-Yue, said.
In Macao, according to the Judicial Police (PJ), nine people were arrested, including three who were undergoing Alipay customer service officials, Macau Daily Times said. The head of the PJ Burlas Coordination Center, Cheong a Hong, revealed that the scheme will be started in April with over 400,000 so -called fraudulent all from Macao.
Locally, 84 victims were embezzled by about 4 million patacas in Alipay's burla scheme. The PJ operation culminated in search of two locations, including a hotel room, where 16 devices were found that allow to hide the origin of the calls.
But in total, the PJ investigated 78 cases that will result in losses of about 12 million patacas, in the freezing of eight bank accounts and in 67,000 patacas confiscated on suspicions of being raised through crimes.
Opening the angle
The joint operation has involved 9,268 cases of fraud, including online purchases, telephone throlles, investment slops and employment frauds, with a total loss of $ 225 million, according to data advanced by Hong Kong police, cited by Global Times. In total, 32,607 bank accounts were frozen and about $ 20 million in fraudulent funds. The detainees are between 14 and 81 years old.
In March, a financial director in Singapore was deceived through fake videos, by someone who went through the executive director of a multinational. The victim transferred $ 499,000 to Hong Kong, said the assistant director of the Singapore Police Anti -Freed Command, Aileen Yap, adding that through transionic cooperation, the money was recovered.
A United Nations report in April found that transnational groups of organized crime in East and Southeast Asian are spreading fraudulent operations around the world.
According to the report issued by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, for several years the groups proliferated in the southeastern Asian continent, especially at the borders of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, as well as in the Philippines, transferring operations from one place to another to escape the police. The centers of the schemes set up in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos are known to attract people to work, using false arguments.
Victims of online burlas and fraud also include workers used in operations that face threats, violence and poor working conditions. Employees are often forced to financially explore people around the world, and many are arrested in virtual slavery.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:31:59</pubDate></item><item><title>STD | Tourism of Mand will go to Bangkok to promote the big bay</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/dst-turismo-da-raem-vai-a-banguecoque-promover-a-grande-baia/</link><description>Between tomorrow and Sunday, the Government of MSar will hold a “large -scale promotion” entitled “Feeling Macau” in the capital of Thailand to “continue the promotional offensive in Southeast Asia's international markets”.

The head of the literary project “Dinis Caixapiz”, born in Macau to encourage reading among the little ones without forgetting environmental responsibility, told Lusa yesterday that the second edition has the merit of arriving in Portugal as well. "We can launch in Lisbon, this for me is the highlight," he told Lusa Susana Diniz, president of Sílba - Educational and Literary Association (syllable - AEL), author of the initiative.
Despite the starting point of this literary project “Always Macao”, because it was in the Chinese region “that was thought and created, with the aim of giving a reading alternative to students who learn Portuguese”, “Dinis Caixapiz” had soon had the objective of reaching the universe of Portuguese -speaking countries.

"The idea is to transport [the initiative] to Portugal and then to the communities. It has to leave somewhere. Leaving Lisbon, the doors open more easily," said the president of the association.

The president of Supermarket and Liveliod Food Association of Macau points to the change of consumer patterns and the increase of Chinese products on local surface shelves, due to the most expensive prices of imported goods
 
After having passed through the rain drops during the pandemic, and even increased invoicing, the large surfaces of Macao supermarkets now cross a period of weak businesses and “unprecedented challenges”. The panorama of difficulties was described by the president of Supermarket and Liveliod Food Association of Macau, Wong Man Wai.
Recently, some supermarkets have closed, including from the Royal and Tai Fung chain, in places such as Jardim Camões and In Areia Preta, with other stores to launch total settlement discount campaigns, implying that they can also end. At Wong Man Wai's optics, this scenario will force chains to think of making adjustments to their operations to adapt to the change of population consumption habits.
Speaking to the newspaper or Mun, the associative leader explained that consumers not only buy less, but they are more selective in choosing goods in the face of “cost-effective”. "In the past, people bought more products imported from abroad, which were more expensive, but now they choose more different products from the interior of China," said the leader, adding that the prices of goods purchased abroad makes them "inventable". For this reason, "supermarket chains do not dare import in large quantities."
The two edges
With the disappearance of foreign products and product proliferation on local supermarket shelves, Wong Man Wai states that consumers can see this adjustment as an incentive to make shopping in Zhuhai, as they will buy the same products in either way. The official also stressed the fact that the large supermarket chains were left out of the big consumption award campaign.
However, not only stores are impacting the low confidence of consumers, also suppliers, especially those who operate outside the most touristy areas, are suffering from a 30 percent reduction. But those who are suffering more, according to Wong Man Wai, are the small and medium suppliers, who face risks of survival and marked breakdare of orders.
High costs with human resources and logistics of supermarkets since the race for home delivery services started other elements highlighted by Wong Man Wai, which places supermarkets in a difficult position to compete with electronic trade platforms in the interior of China.
The leader also mentioned the possibility, which was advanced by various media, opening a large supermarket in Gongbei as the “gout of water” for many surfaces in Macao, which can close within a year.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:25:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Borders | More than 390 thousand visited Macau on the weekend</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/fronteiras-mais-de-390-mil-visitaram-macau-no-fim-de-semana/</link><description>Last weekend, due to the Dragon Boat Day holiday, 390,442 visitors entered Macao, according to data released by the Public Security Police (CPSP), a total that represented an increase of almost 14 percent over the same period last year.

Macao employed nearly 183,600 non-resident workers at the end of this year, an increase of 31,700 since the end of the Zero Covid policy in January 2023, it was announced yesterday. According to data from the Public Security Police (CPSP), released by the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs, the territory had 183,568 workers without resident status.
This number has been an increase of 20.9 percent since January 2023, when the covid zero policy, which was in force for about three years. This month, migrant workers in Macao, including those from mainland China, were less than 152,000, the lowest number since April 2014.
Macao, which as China followed Covid Zero's policy, reopened borders to all foreigners, including non-resident workers, from January 8, 2023, after nearly three years of strict restrictions.
The hotel and restoration sector was the one that has hired the most since January 2023, winning 17,424 non-resident workers, followed by domestic employees (plus 4,780) and casinos (plus 2,895). The hotel and restoration area was precisely the most affected by loss of labor during the pandemic and more than 17,600 non-resident employees since December 2019 has been fired.

The Four welcomed, in the first four months of 2025, 13 million visitors, 12.9 percent than in the same period of 2024 and the second highest value ever for a year start.
The economic crisis created by the pandemic led the unemployment rate to reach 4 percent in the third quarter of 2022, the highest since 2006. Despite the number of non-resident workers, the unemployment rate remained 1.9 percent between February and April.
Macao's economy shot 1.3 percent between January and March, especially due to the “change in the consumption pattern of visitors,” according to the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services. It was the first time that the territory's gross domestic product has shrunk in homologous terms since the end of 2022, when the region began to raise restrictions due to Covid-19 pandemic.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:47:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Broadway | Francis Lui points to possible renewal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/broadway-francis-lui-aponta-para-possivel-renovacao/</link><description>Galaxy president Francis Lui revealed that the group he leads is facing the possibility of renewing the integrated Broadway resort in the future, but for now, the priority remains the construction of the 4th phase of Galaxy Macau, which will have a theme park.

It is recalled that the group recently opened Capella at Galaxy Macau, which offers 36 luxurious villages.
Francis Lui added that the gap in the market causes the thousands of tourists coming from the interior of China to watch the shows in Macao end up not staying overnight due to the high prices of accommodation, a gap that cannot be collected even with a renewed Broadway that only offers 300 rooms.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:45:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us his wife and daughter (cf. Recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: High there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not abandon what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. What is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstandings, if they are fortunately fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered a war, the best animals will be beheaded. superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

"I like President Xi from China, I always liked it and I will always like it, but it is very difficult," said the US leader on his Truth social network the day when customs on steel and aluminum imported by the US increased to 50 percent.
Trump's statements come at a time when US press advances with the possibility of the two leaders approaching a final deal by telephone that attenuate commercial tensions.
It was not clear if Trump spoke to Xi, however. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused the United States on Tuesday to violate the provisional trade agreement in Geneva last month by imposing "negative measures," such as the latest restrictions on semiconductor exports or the annulment of visas from Chinese students. Wang made those statements during a meeting with the new US ambassador to China, David Perdue.
"Unfortunately, the US recently introduced a series of negative measures based on unfounded fundamentals, impairing China's legitimate rights and interests," Wang said during the meeting in Beijing, according to a statement widespread by the Chinese government. Wang called on the US to "create the conditions necessary for [bilateral] relationships to return to the right way."
Trump has previously been confident that a conversation with XI can relieve commercial tensions, although it is not clear that this call is being organized.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 00:06:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Airbus | China Negoceia Buying Hundreds of Airplanes</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/05/airbus-china-negoceia-compra-de-centenas-de-avioes/</link><description>China is considering the possibility of ordering hundreds of airplanes from European Construtora Airbus next month, at the time of the 50th anniversary of official relations between the country and the European Union, Bloomberg yesterday advanced.
According to the news agency, which cites unidentified sources, the business may focus on about 300 narrow and narrow fuselage aircraft, while another source advances with 500 devices, which would constitute one of the largest airplanes in history and the largest for China.
In any case, these sources claim that negotiations are still open and that the business may not materialize or be closed on a later date.
So far, neither Airbus nor the Chinese authorities responsible for the aircraft negotiations have issued any official confirmation on the subject. France and Germany, two of the countries that control Airbus, will be able to send their leaders, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz, to the China - EU, which takes place in July, in Beijing.
New alliances
If the agreement is signed at that time, it may also be interpreted as a sign of Chinese President Xi Jinping to his US counterpart Donald Trump that he intends to strengthen commercial ties with the EU, at a time when Beijing's ties with Washington deteriorate due to trade war between the two powers.
However, Bloomberg points to Airbus's main rival, the American Boeing, as one of the potential winners of a hypothetical trade agreement between Beijing and Washington. In the recent Commercial Pact with the UK, one of the most important points was precisely the sale of aircraft.
But Boeing has been in difficulties in the Chinese market for years, compared to commercial tensions and concerns about the security of its planes, which resulted in a ban of nearly five years of 737 MAX, after two accidents with a total of 346 dead in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
This, associated with other temporary prohibitions, such as the ban, for a month, between April and May, from the delivery of Boeing aircraft to Chinese companies due to the escalation of the trade war between Beijing and Washington, allowed Airbus to gain advantage in China in recent years. Boeing has not received a major order from China since at least 2017.</description><pubDate>2025-06-05 00:04:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Man accused of alleged threat of bomb against concert</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/hong-kong-homem-acusado-de-alegada-ameaca-de-bomba-contra-concerto/</link><description>Hong Kong police announced yesterday that they accused a 35 -year -old man of four crimes of a "bomb threat" against a concert and against the representation of the Chinese central government in the semiautony region.
In a statement, the Hong Kong National Police Security Department said the 35 -year -old suspect will be presented at the Kwun Tong Magistrates Court. On Tuesday, police had announced the detention of men and four women, between 24 and 38, for "conspiracy to commit terrorist activities."
According to an investigation, the five suspects will have sent several messages to the police, via telephone, electronic mail and messaging platforms, between April 29 and May 13. Messages included threats to explode bombs placed in various Chinese central government offices in Hong Kong and Kai Tak Sports Park, police said.
The last call included a bomb threat against a concert on May 13, said at a press conference, the superintendent of the National Security Department, Steve Li Kwai-Wah. Kai Tak Sports Park, which opened in March, is part of a stadium with a place for 50,000 spectators, which hosted, on May 13, a Mayday concert, a Taiwan band.
According to local press, Steve Li said police searched the stadium that same day, but found nothing suspect and that the concert was normal. The statement indicates that the suspects will also have sent "seditious messages that incited Taiwan and Hong Kong's independence."
Steve Li said the five suspects were arrested on Monday following four homes searches, during which mobile phones and computers were seized. The four women were released under bail, "while further investigations are awaited," the statement said.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:43:03</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korea | Xi Jinping Felicita Lee Jae-Myung for the presidential victory</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/coreia-do-sul-xi-jinping-felicita-lee-jae-myung-pela-vitoria-nas-presidenciais/</link><description>Chinese President Xi Jinping yesterday sent a message of congratulations to liberal Lee Jae-Myung for the victory in the South Korean presidential elections and called for cooperation so that the two countries maintain the "good neighborhood and friendship."
"In the 33 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, both sides have overcome ideological and social differences, worked in close collaboration, achieved successful and healthy development of their relationships," Xi said in a telegram, quoted by the Chinese official news agency Xinhua.
The Chinese leader said he attributes “great importance” to ties with Seoul and said the country is willing to work with South Korea to “jointly promote the strategic partnership of cooperation” between the two nations, despite citing “the growing uncertainty in the international and regional situation”.
China is South Korea's largest commercial partner, but despite strong economic ties, bilateral relations are marked by a constant iron arm on regional rivalries, historical sensitivities and contradictory strategic interests.
Beijing criticized Seoul for narrowing the ties with Washington under the deterioration of North Korea, while China has opposed UN new sanctions against Pyongyang in recent years.
Liberal Lee Jae-Myung won the presidential election of South Korea on Tuesday with 49.4 percent of the votes, against 41.1 percent of conservative rival Kim Moon-SOO.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:39:21</pubDate></item><item><title>WTO | China requires supervision of “unilateral tariffs”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/omc-china-exige-supervisao-de-tarifas-unilaterais/</link><description>The Chinese trade representative was in Paris where he discussed with the WTO Director-General the serious international situation
 
Chinese commerce minister Wang Wenta has urged the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reinforce the supervision of “unilateral tariffs” and present “objective and neutral” political proposals, according to a statement released yesterday.
According to the Chinese Ministry of Trade, Wang met Tuesday with WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting of the organization in Paris, where they maintained an "in-depth discussion about the serious situation of world trade."
"In response to the arbitrary imposition of tariffs by some members, the WTO should reinforce the supervision of these unilateral tariffs and offer objective and neutral political recommendations," the ministry said in a veiled reference to the United States.
The message also urged the WTO member countries to ensure that any bilateral trade agreements "comply with the rules" of the organization and "avoid harming the interests of third parties."
Wang reiterated China's position of defending "a multilateral commercial system" and said the WTO has its support to play "a more important role in global economic governance."
The Chinese minister also met with the European Commissioner for Trade, Maros Sefcovic, with whom he maintained “deep, frank and comprehensive discussions” about “urgent and important issues related to economic and commercial cooperation between China and the European Union”.
According to the ministry, Wang has appealed to greater efforts to “prepare the important agenda between China and the EU this year”, which includes a summit to celebrate the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations.
Travel to Beijing
The presidents of the European Commission and the European Council, Ursula Von Der Leyen and António Costa, respectively, are expected to travel to Beijing in the second half of July to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Von der Leyen said the EU should "work constructively with China to find solutions" throughout this year, and that Brussels should "maintain a more balanced relationship with Beijing, in a spirit of justice and reciprocity."
The EU also appealed to China to avoid “a new climb” in the trade war triggered by the tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, although Beijing believes that Washington is not fulfilling the agreement reached by the two powers in Geneva.
Other conversations
For his part, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met Tuesday with the United States Ambassador in China, David Pound, to whom he drew attention to the recent introduction of "a series of negative measures based on unfounded arguments, undermining China's legitimate rights and interests."
“We firmly oppose that,” said Chinese diplomacy chief. Among the measures are the suspension of sales of computer programs for semiconductor design, new controls to vital semiconductor exports to artificial intelligence and revocation of visas to Chinese students, a measure that China has described as discriminatory.
On May 12, both powers agreed a three -month tariff truce, in which the US pledged to reduce 145 percent rates to 30 percent and China from 125 percent to 10 percent in an attempt to make way to a broader deal.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 23:36:00</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korea | Left candidate wins presidential</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/coreia-do-sul-candidato-da-esquerda-vence-presidenciais/</link><description>Opposition candidate Lee Jae-Myung (Center left) is given as a winner of the presidential election in South Korea, with 51.7 percent of the votes, according to the projections released after the closing of this vote with a single lap.
According to the polls at the mouth of the ballot box, Lee Jae-Myung (Democratic Party) obtained 51.7 percent of the votes, compared to 39.3 percent of his main opponent, conservative Kim Moon-soo (PPP, right), reported the three largest South Korean television broadcasters.
This vote, whose result still needs to be confirmed by the National Electoral Commission, should allow South Korea to recover a leader and political stability, after six months of crisis triggered by the previous head of state, Yoon Suk Yeol.
In early December, Yoon surprisingly stated the martial law and sent the army to take over the control of Parliament, widely dominated by the opposition, in order to silence it. At the time, enough deputies managed to meet to vote for a motion and quickly fail the initiative of the then president, which was classified as a stroke.
Six months followed in deep political chaos, among massive demonstrations, arrest and dismissal of Yoon Suk Yeol, an unprecedented succession of Interinian presidents and other twists, namely judicial.
If his victory is approved, Lee Jae-Myung, a former 61-year-old worker, will have the difficult task of facing the threat represented by the unpredictable North Korean neighbor, while positioning himself between China, South Korea's main commercial partner, and the United States, ally and historical protector.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 01:01:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism | Ectaa wants easier visas for Chinese</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/turismo-ectaa-quer-vistos-mais-faceis-para-chineses/</link><description>The leader of the European Confederation of Travel Agency Associations and Tour Operators argued yesterday that the European Union facilitates the entry to Chinese, after China has extended the exemption of visas to over 30 European countries.
"We will continue to knock on the European Commission door to lower the threshold for visitors from outside Europe," said the president of the European Confederation of Travel Agency Associations and Tour Operators (ECTAA). Frank Oostdam spoke in Macao at a press conference when asked about the European response to China's visa exemption policy, which since October 15 covers Portugal.
In late March, the Chinese ambassador in Lisbon Zhao Bentang said in an interview with Lusa that "China has already asked Europe, Portugal, that facilitates the entry to Chinese citizens." But the Dutch Frank Oostdam admitted that “the political climate is not encouraging” and that the current trend is for further restrictions on entering the European Union, giving as an example the Netherlands.
Oostdam spoke hours before the leader of the far right of the Netherlands, Geert Wilders, had removed the party from the government coalition, due to disagreement over immigration, paving the way to early elections. Wilders required a radical reduction in migration, reinforcing border controls, and rejection of all asylum applicants.
“We would like to have as many people travel the world as much as possible, but I'm not that confident,” said Frank Oostdam. "We are very in favor of freedom of circulation, because if people know each other, we will have a better world," said the president of Ectaa.
In the same tone
Before the press conference, also the president of the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT) lamented “there was no same solution from Europe's point of view regarding Chinese tourists”. “We would really like to happen, this is the opinion of ECTAA, this is the position of APAVT. The visas are harmful to mobility and mobility is good for the world,” defended Pedro Costa Ferreira.
In the case of Portugal, the visa exemption for entry to China is in force until December 31, but Frank Oostdam has shown hope that it will be “prolonged for many years”. "From what we hear, the situation seems optimistic. Hopefully yes, because the visa issue is really essential to explore the potential of tourism from Europe to China," said the leader.
"If we do not have [visa exemption], the potential is there, but it will not result in much more tourists," warned the Dutch. Ectaa vice president, Heli Maki-Franti, lamented that the closing of Russia airspace led the airlines to “dramatically reduce” the number of flights to China.
The European Union closed airspace to Russian aircraft after the invasion of Ukraine, and Moscow retaliated with similar prohibitions, making the links between Asia and Europe more expensive. "Many customers are not willing to pay," said Maki-Fanti.
Macau's Director of Tourism Services (STD), Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, said this represents “a clear opportunity” to Chinese carriers, “because they can fly over Russian territory”. The problem, said Heli Maki-Fanti, is that European travelers "do not yet know Chinese airlines." "There is a lot of [promotion work] that these companies could do in the European market," added the Finnish.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:59:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs | China accuses USA of breaking agreement with “extreme suppression” measures</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/tarifas-china-acusa-eua-de-quebrar-acordo-com-medidas-de-supressao-extrema/</link><description>Beijing accused Washington yesterday of violating an agreement reached in May to temporarily reduce customs rates with “extreme suppression” measures, such as restricting semiconductor exports and nullifying visas to Chinese students.
"Geneva's consensus was achieved based on mutual respect and consultation equality. China has implemented it responsibly and in good faith. However, the US implemented unilateral and unfounded restrictions," said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian.
China, who said he had presented a formal protest, urged Washington to "correct his wrong actions" and "respect the harsh consensus." "The use of pressure and coercion is not the correct way to deal with China," said Lin.
Beijing said on Monday, through its Ministry of Commerce, that since the commercial pact was sealed on May 12, Washington has adopted new measures that "seriously undermine" the commitments made, including the suspension of sales of software used in the manufacturer of semiconductors, new controls on the export of chips used in artificial intelligence systems and the recent revocation of visas for Chinese students, a measure that China described as "discriminatory."
Tensions have increased in recent days, with new restrictions imposed by Washington and a fall of about 20 percent in US imports of Chinese products in April.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged last week that negotiations are stopped and said that a call between Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, could break the impasse.
White House Economic Counselor Kevin Hassett said on Sunday that there is still no scheduled conversation between the two leaders, although they expect them to talk about trade next week.

"We will continue to optimize our entry policies, widen the number of visited countries, and to invite more international friends to try China's quality consumer products, services and consumer offers," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a press conference.
Since June 1, citizens of Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay can enter China without visa up to 30 days, as part of a pilot initiative announced during the last Latin American and Caribbean Community (Celac) community.
With the entry into force, on June 9, of the exemption from a Saudi Arabia citizens, Oman, Kuwait and Barém, the number of countries with access to China with visa exemption will increase to 43. Policy has also encompassed Portugal since last year.
World
This expansion reflects Beijing's commitment to a “high -level opening” and the construction of an “open world economy,” said Lin. The spokesman stressed that entry facilitation measures “are already producing concrete results”: in the first quarter of 2025, more than nine million foreigners entered China, an increase of more than 40 percent, compared to the same period last year.
In addition, more than 18,000 new companies with foreign investment were created in China between January and April, a homologous increase of 12.1 percent, according to official data cited by Lin.
Beijing believes these policies will help boost tourism, reinforce ties with partner countries, and project a modern and accessible image of China after years of border restrictions due to Covid-19 pandemic.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:50:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck at Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the appropriate place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macao, Camões has been poorly used in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Rui Leão, architect and co-author of “Layering the City” | A four -hand city</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/16/rui-leao-arquitecto-e-co-autor-de-layering-the-city-uma-cidade-a-quatro-maos/</link><description>Architects Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni have accumulated many drawings over the years, which have now been materialized in “Layering the City”, a work that was released last week at the Venice Architecture Biennial. The book results from two lives dedicated to architecture and two doctoral theses defended at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
 
How does the initiative come to publish “Layering the City”, which makes the retrospective of your work a little?
This project is born from a dialogue between my dissertation thesis and Carlotta [Carlotta Bruni] dissertation thesis, who both take different aspects of our contribution as architects to Macao to the city. And therefore, the project of this book is the encounter of these two theses.
The title of the book refers to the idea of ​​a town in layers.
No, what happens is that in the case of our views, my and Carlotta, there is work brought by each one to the project, and which gives a response to the programmed request, what the client asks, to what lives in the alignment plant [of the project], or a series of questions at civic, public space or the right to quality of life. There are a number of social dimensions [to take into account] to make spaces for people, even when they are impossible [in terms] of politics and in the city. It is these layers that go into the projects and that, deep down, are creating opportunities to qualify the life of the city, the person, the street. And this has nothing to do with those who pay, it has to do with the management that the architect makes in the city through the project. It is these layers, the layers, in which the architect is enriching what is the project's offer to the city and creates several micro-projects within this larger project, which qualify the ride, social spaces and public space in a way that was not requested.
Therefore, in a project of architecture always persists the idea of ​​the people and the spaces they inhabit.
In the case of Macau there is this extreme situation where the public space is always the minimum, with a narrow walk, and where everything is resolved. Because there is a lack of more public space profile in the city, this management done by the architect through the project turns out to be a way to compensate for the city, to reconcile people with it, or the opposite.
The cover of the book refers to Fai Chi Kei's public housing project. I assume that they consider the project one of the great milestones of your studio.
Undoubtedly. This was the first large housing building in collective terms, where we had the opportunity to apply ideas that we had developed to the public space, in Praça do Lago, or even in the park next door. All of these projects have a lot of involvement with the public space and this was our first initiative with a housing program. We did a number of super important experiences that allowed us to demonstrate that it was possible to qualify public housing. We produce a series of gardens, packets, air gardens in various floors [from the building]. We were collecting the floors two to two and four to four to create communities inside the building, almost like a Chinese pharmacy that has drawers, social interaction sites since the bottom floor, and so on. All of this has been worked with small public terraces present throughout the project, and in this respect, it is very innovative. It is, in fact, a demonstration that, whether it is a housing building or a museum, it can indeed contribute to the qualification of people's lives. Any [architecture program, in order to order or contract] it serves for the architect to act on the project.
What other projects are in this book?
We have the Barra station and the intermodal zone [related to the light meter]. There are two projects, for us, very important, because they also come to reconfirm the ability to overlap many and many layers. In the case of Barra Station, there is also a public park on top, and the two marginals, the historic and the new. It is an all -glass, transparent project that allows me to be on the side of the slaughterhouse and see the river and boats through the glass. The building turns out to be a kind of octopus that makes ground level connections, with the gardens around the season that connect with the roof. There is a certain complexity, in which almost a new city system is created and there is at the same time a trial overlap of the train, buses and the passing people. The book also has projects that are not yet built.
What was it like to combine the content of your doctoral thesis with that of Carlotta Bruni?
The book consists of texts by some critics about our work. There is a text by Jorge Figueira, for example, and a great interview conducted by Ana Vaz Milheiro [Academic] and then has our texts.
Is there a presence by architect Manuel Vicente in this work?
Manuel Vicente is very present, because some of these projects were made in partnership with him. Therefore, there is a continuity of these first projects for those who came next, already without Manuel Vicente, and who is very polished for us. Deep down, it has to do with what we not only inherited, but what we brought with us from Manuel.
Presenting this work at the Venice Architecture Biennial, and considering that the MSAR is also represented with an exhibition, is it important for your work and visibility of the studio?
Yes. The idea of ​​publication, with Barcelona's Actar Books, has to do with putting the work, and more than that, its message, which is very specific to Macau and our way of working in the international and architects community, and this goes a lot through the Biennial. It was also in Europe that a consensus was built on the level of descriptions [in architecture] for a few centuries, and where there is a discussion, national and international, around the issues of the profession. We want our work to be present, either through the book and through acting Books, in this international community, to be part of the world.
Leaves and layers
“Layering the City” intends to establish with the international community of architects and passionate about the profession a dialogue showing the last years of work and the vision of the LBA - Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni's architecture and planning. The work is born of the intersection between two doctoral theses of the two architects: “Designing by Increments: Opportunistic Planning as Urban Strategy for Macau” (by Rui Leão) and “Shaping Macau’s Unpurposed Space: Design in Context” (by Carlotta Bruni).
According to a book presentation, "LBA's intellectual contributions are evidenced through spatial narratives that integrate complex urban contexts with culturally sensitive design strategies."
The two architects and their team "emphasize the importance of creating spaces that harmonize with their surroundings, while responding to the functional needs of modern urban life." It is therefore a “particularly relevant approach in Macao, where the juxtaposition of the old and the new is a defining characteristic of the city”, it reads.</description><pubDate>2025-05-16 01:04:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Álvaro Barbosa, vice-rector of the University of São José: “Student visa is very limiting”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/alvaro-barbosa-vice-reitor-da-universidade-de-sao-jose-visto-de-estudante-e-muito-limitativo/</link><description>The University of São José continues the negotiation saga with the Chinese authorities to recruit students from the interior of China. Vice-rector Álvaro Barbosa expects, soon, the increase in master's students from 30 to 200. Regarding the internationalization of higher education, the official advocates changes in student visas to facilitate recruitment
 
Does the recruitment of students from the interior of China remain a matter pending to the University of Saint Joseph?
It is a process that is underway. We have had huge support from the Macao government in negotiations to obtain the quota for our university, and they have been tireless in the effort to try to resolve the issues raised by the central government. Many of the questions are legitimate and concern concerns that arise. We were granted a temporary quota of 30 students for masters ago over a probative period, which served to evaluate how we, as Western University, would host students from China. From China, there is this concern with the host of students in Macau. I think we have made a huge effort and the students who are there, included in this contingent, are quite satisfied.
Is this quota for masters just?
Yes. For a degree we do not have authorization yet. In this way, we are currently at the time we try to overcome this probative period in order to obtain a quota of about 200 students for masters. We are in the final phase of the evaluation process and everything has been doing well. We will have the possibility that, next academic year, expand this quota. That would be great, because for our university, to have a greater impact of our mission in Macao, it is essential to have access to students from mainland China. We cannot be a university in an integrated region in a country like China, and not contact with students from China.
Is it more difficult for USJ to compete with other universities, such as those of Hong Kong, by foreign students, outside China?
The issue of recruitment of international students has become a priority for Macao universities. In the last two or three years, it has become evident that this internationalization is very important. What difficulty is there? There is the issue related to student visas, as these visas currently do not allow students to do any kind of work, denying them that minimum local subsistence mechanism to be able to meet expenses. Nor is it contemplated the possibility of, when the student concludes his formation, to be in the territory and find work. What all countries and regions that are competitive in higher education do, such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Australia, is to have incentive policies. Allow students to work part -time, for example. In Hong Kong when a degree ends, the student can stay in the territory up to a maximum of two years to find a job. This kind of measures do not yet exist in Macau, but I think the government is pondering this possibility. From the moment the decision was made that the internationalization of higher education was important, this must be accompanied with the corresponding measures. The current student visa is extremely limiting and does not encourage the coming to Macao to study, only allows coming. This issue was not as present as it is now, but now there is a strategic policy of internationalization.
It is also a matter of survival for local universities.
Yes. Perhaps there is no greater example of a catalyst for the diversification of Macau's economy than higher education. We have ten institutions, 60,000 students in about 700,000 inhabitants. This is the potential of internationalization, to foster diversification.

And also the research that comes out of higher education.
The investigation, the dynamics of the work that is done. There are a number of vectors that higher education brings to a region or country, this happened to Portugal, for example, with the policy of doctoral scholarships for students from abroad, which completely changed the dynamics of higher education. Cape Verde developed thanks to the impact of higher education.
Then we need to make the system more flexible in Macau.
I don't know if it's a matter of having a holistic view of strategy. There may be an idea, but then it does not intervene in all the necessary dimensions to achieve a certain goal. But I am very optimistic. I believe this new student policy is a key step to be taken in Macau. The internationalization strategy followed by all these countries and regions I spoke, and were successful in capturing international students, was always the same. No need to invent much. First, one should increase the capacity and notoriety of universities, and then a policy of scholarships, which will enhance a student flow, creating a reference for the territory, so that studying there becomes a habit. After this flow of students for a few years, an image is already created and some scholarships can be removed, which students will continue to choose a particular territory to study in it. Australia has a huge higher education industry, for example, and I think that in Macau we just have to follow the same strategies. We do, at USJ, that a little.
How, in concrete terms?
We offer many scholarships, and in this sense the Diocese of Macao has helped us build this flow of international students that allow us to create this dynamic that we hope will be sustainable by itself in the future. I think the government is also doing this. There have always been scholarships in Macau, attributed mainly by the Macau Foundation, but this measure will be strengthened. Solving the student's visa issue, creating a scholarship incentive system for five to ten years, Macau will have a bright future as an international higher education destination. But we need to invest, continue, and it takes a few years.
USJ created the “Macau Hub” platform, in partnership with the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in 2023. At what stage is this project?
This project has to do with our interest in developing a relationship dynamic of Lusophone countries centered in Lisbon in the area of ​​entrepreneurship, first. This cabinet we have at CCCM is not intended to offer training in Portugal, but we want to do something else. As we are positioned in the Great Bay and with Hengqin, where it is intended to activate a business ecosystem, we want to take advantage of the fact that we have relations with the Lusophone world to activate the access of the startups of Portugal, Brazil and Angola, above all, to the great bay and hengqin. We are trying to create a kind of incubator of transnational companies, in which we support the development of Lusophone businesses that want to settle in the large bay and also the reverse system. Strategically, for a university, it is absolutely fundamental to have a dynamic in the area of ​​entrepreneurship. Currently, more than half of our students do not want to go to the corporate world, but create their own businesses. Just as universities have to have employability solutions, they also have to have them for entrepreneurs, who are increasingly. So a university has to have a business incubator. My vision of the future for higher education goes around: a university, besides having a library and canteen, will also have its own business incubator. I would say that most students of management or economy courses dream of having their own business, especially in China. China is perhaps one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world. The CCCM welcomes this initiative in Portugal, but we also work with the Portuguese Catholic University.
And concrete results, already have it?
We have a number of small initial projects that are starting now, and we also work with many business organizations. We have now negotiated a series of projects, and I think everything will develop very quickly, based on the manifestations of interest we have. We were in Angola in December and we have already aligned a series of initiatives, we also have projects with Brazil and Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:56:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Adelina Moura, teacher and trainer: “The mobile phone is like a Swiss knife”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/adelina-moura-docente-e-formadora-o-telemovel-e-como-um-canivete-suico/</link><description>Graduated in the area of ​​educational technologies, Adelina Moura will conduct lectures to parents, students and teachers about the use of digital technologies in classrooms, within the “Letters &amp; Company” festival of the Portuguese Institute of the East. The teacher understands that prohibiting mobile phone in schools is not a solution
 
What are the challenges felt by teachers with the introduction of technologies in the classroom? Can the mobile phone actually be a complement to learning?
Yes. I've been saying this since 2005. The mobile phone can be an excellent learning tool, a means to motivate students and to enrich their learning. We have a kind of Swiss knife here, a very powerful equipment in the hands of the students and there is a school failure, because they do not work and help students enhance this equipment they have. What happens is that students learn in the worst way, in a destructed way, by attempt-rrove. There is a gap, as students are not alerted to the positive potential for mobile phone use. They face their mobile phones as a free time use, spending time on social networks and scrolling, and time consumes. It is essential that teachers are users, in their practices, mobile phones, and for the preparation of classes and other projects, to know how to prepare students. I consider that the school has lost several stages of students' preparation and awareness to use these equipment that lead to classes and with which schools have not spent any money. With the prohibition of bringing the mobile phone to the classroom we did not advance anything in this regard.
During the pandemic period, for example, the use of technologies, with distance learning, was quite enhanced.
But during the pandemic we also burned some steps regarding the use of digital by teachers, because before the pandemic many teachers did not believe or used. They thought it was a fashion and they saw no use in the use of mobile phones and other technologies. With the pandemic the use of these equipment proved that without them the situation of education would have been much worse. In these pandemic years, teachers have become more aware of the technologies that already exist and are available to anyone. With internet access on mobile phone, something that has existed since 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone, the e-learning system is enhanced and then we move to “Mobile Learning”, where you can learn anywhere and anytime with mobile devices. It is this reality that we see a little away from school.
And after the pandemic, how has it been?
I think we will take a few more steps towards digital literacy. With Artificial Intelligence (IA), it seems that we are as in the phase I created my first website in 1999 or email in 1995. We are at the beginning. But it is 30 years of technology where there have been many changes, and technology in fact goes on and if we immediately do not realize what we have available, we and students, we help create a moat that has happened in the past compared to digital. In the face of AI, if we do not look back and do not realize what was not done and should have been at school level, we are wasting time. Only a few years from now will people be alert to AI, and the gap is increasing. Hence it is very important to bet now, in this early stage, in the training of teachers, students and families.
Is there much ignorance of parents, removal from this reality?
We have parents who are from this century. That is, they were born with the existence of computers, internet, saw the appearance of the smartphone. But when they studied, the school did not talk about the potential of digital. So these former students came to society and did not bring this sensitivity to digital, to educate their children. We teachers, when we do digital training, are doing good to society because we are also preparing these young people for the future, because they will be parents and should be aware of educating their children. At school we do not only prepare for the job market, but for personal and family life. Hence teacher education is essential. The invitation I received from IPOR seems to me an excellent holistic view of everything, because the school includes several actors, connecting with society.
How should AI be introduced into the classroom?
We currently watch changes in search engines, in fact. We have search engines created from root to Age Age, for example. The best way to introduce AI into the classroom is to ask students and how they use it, and already resort to this tool. At the beginning of the academic year I always ask students to answer a questionnaire about their digital routines, and then I know more or less their practices. In 2023, when the chatgPT came out, I introduced AI in my classes, and realized that students were using this tool to deceive the teachers. Students have to realize that when using AI, they are falling into a certain trap because they are not learning. It is the law of the lowest effort, equal to the phase in which the internet emerged, when students selected, copied and sent to the teacher. We now have the problem that the answers are in Brazilian Portuguese, for example, and I see soon that AI was used. We have, therefore, to dismantle this action in the heads and face them. I tell them that they are being intellectually dishonest and that they have not read the AI ​​response, for example. Since 2023, I feel that students, in the answers to this questionnaire I do, say they are afraid to use chatgpt because they are afraid of being caught by teachers. That is, it seems to have gained some conscience.
It will give these lectures in a different educational context in Asia, where the use of mobile phone can be earlier. How will you deal with these differences, or do you understand that the problems of using technology in the classroom are transversal?
It is a transverse question. Do we have to wonder if the use of a particular equipment and tool will make us wiser? It seems to me not, because we may have the equipment, but the use we make it varies a lot. I tell my students that they should be ashamed, because they have much easier access to content than in my time, when we truly had to do research and read in physical format. I tell them that with this technology they should all have a grade 20, and that they are wasting resources, being dishonest intellectually, because they sign works that are not theirs and do not read, even, they deliver. One of the works we have with students is to teach them how to make bibliographic references, refer to the sources. But I am an optimistic by nature, and I hope that in a decade, secondary education students who are fathers and mothers will be able to deal with these problems of social networks and increase fraud with their children. It is this “parents school” that the school can help create. We are in a moment with no return from digital, and forbidding is the most comfortable situation, but it is not the best to face reality. We have to use the right words to alert. We have in this time of alerts and consciences, encouraging the critical spirit of our students, which is little today.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. In fact, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Fit F4 World Cup will be in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/09/primeira-taca-do-mundo-de-f4-sera-em-macau/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA), announced on Wednesday afternoon that the 2025 Macao Grand Prix will feature its program with the first edition of the Formula 4 World Cup.
The World Council of Motorsport approved by electronic vote the creation of this Formula 4 World Cup in Macao, along with the return to the Territory of the Regional Formula World Cup, which in 2023 came to occupy the place of Formula 3, and the FIA ​​GT World Cup.
The concept of Formula 4 has been introduced by the FIA ​​for over a decade and has been one of the biggest success stories of motorized training sport, currently there are 13 different national championships within the technical and sports framework of the FIA. This will be the fourth time the discipline runs in Macao, having been a regular presence from 2020 to 2023, and was even “head of poster” in the three years the world was immersed in the pandemic.
The FIA ​​did not say how the pilots will be chosen, just referring in a statement that there will be "a rigorous pilot selection process, with only the most talented young people to be authorized to compete." The International Federation also stressed that the Chinese company “Mintimes, organizer of the F4 Chinese Championship, will be the Single Operator, along with FFSA (Fédération Française du Sport Automobile), responsible for providing technical support to the F4 F4 World Cup”. This means that all competitors will have to use Mygale M21-F4 singleolugar, recently renamed Ligier JS F422.
Paris support
The chairman of the FIA ​​monoligae commission, the Italian Emanuele Pirro, said that “Macau is an essential part of the formation of a young pilot, and we have a duty to protect his legacy and future. There is as few challenges as the Macao Grand Prix that we feel that it was the right time to introduce the F4 Fia World Cup. From F4, which is a little more permissive than a regional formula car, so that when they return to a year or two to the FR world cup, they are prepared to truly show what they are capable. ”
Emanuele Pirro, a former guide race vender and a MSAR test enthusiast, also said that "we are also working hard to ensure that we take this opportunity to inspire and educate young Karting riders in the region. The growth and development potential in China and the Asia Pacific region is huge as we boost participating in motorized sport."
Thinking about Macau
The FIA ​​long statement also states that this initiative “also aims to bring students from Karting de Macao, China and the region in general to watch the event in an observational manner, offering them the opportunity to experience a racing test and to obtain valuable knowledge for the next steps in their careers”.
Without going into detail, the international federation, which did not allow it to decline on the participation of Chinese teams in the regional formula cup last year, says that “this big step will undoubtedly benefit local Macao pilots, which will have access to a complete range of international events - Karting, Formula 4 and Regional Formula - on national soil”.
In a statement of Chong Coc Veng, president of the Macau-China General Automobile Association, he stated: “We are happy to see the FIA ​​hold a F4 World Cup at the Guide Circuit in Macao, which represents an opportunity for young people in the region to find their way of development from the international events of Karting to F4 and FR monoligles, and become world champions in the future.”
The participation of MSar pilots in this race has not yet been officially disclosed, but may be limited in number.</description><pubDate>2025-05-09 00:41:31</pubDate></item><item><title>ESPORTS | First Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup Decided in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/06/esports-primeira-taca-fia-girls-on-track-esports-decidida-em-macau/</link><description>Next June, for the first time in its history, Macau will host the Extraordinary General Meetings and the Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). This event, which will take place at Galaxy International Convention Center, from 10 to 13 June, will be complemented with extra activity: the first edition of the “Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup”
 
The worldwide body that governs motorized sport has announced this new competition of Sim Racing, which is being organized in partnership with the Advanced Simracing Race Simulation Cockpits and the popular SIM Racing Iracing game, will be directed to 16 or older female elements, regardless of the ESports previous experience. To apply, participants must register on the FIA ​​official website. In addition, it is necessary to have an active account in Iracing to compete.
Online qualifications for the competition, whose finals will be held at MSAR, have already started officially. The first phase consists of participants trying to record the fastest return on Iracing's Attack team. This online qualification phase ends on May 6th. After this first stage, the top 10 classifieds will be invited to participate in the Grande Final, which will take place at the Week of Extraordinary General Meetings and the 2025 FIA Conference, scheduled from June 10 to 13. In Macao, participants will compete in a several day -to -day face -to -face final, where the first champion of the “Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup” will be crowned.
"We know that eSports are the future, but for this discipline to grow and truly develop, we need to encourage more girls and women to get involved," said Ciscal Niroshan Pereira, the current chairman of the FIA ​​eSports committee. “We hope this competition will serve as a catalyst, encouraging aspiring pilot to experience our discipline and consider a career in motorized sport.”
According to FIA, the 10 finalists will also have access to a training program on how to deal with social communication and networking opportunities, gaining a valuable view of the motor sport industry.
Grow on all fronts
This is the first time the fia girls on track initiative has been involved in a eSports competition. His best known project was probably the Fia Girls On Track-Rising Stars program, an initiative aimed at promoting car sports with the female audience aged 13 to 18, and supported young women's pilots between 2020 and 2023. It is recalled that only 1.5 percent of the total sports licenses are women.
Burcu çetinkaya, the president of the FIA ​​Women in Motorsport committee, said that “FIA is committed to double participating in motorized sports and creating more opportunities for women and girls. Electronic sports allow us to reach more vast and younger audiences-especially those with discovering or with limited access to traditional motorized sports. The winner - at the event in Macau. ”
FIA's decision to launch a eSports competition exclusively for women also reinforces the body's bet on the digital landscape. Electronic sports are an increasingly important part of the FIA ​​base development program.
Last year, the Federation added an Appendix of ESPORTS (Appendix E) to the International Sports Code, allowing national sports authorities to regulate and manage national and international competitions. The FIA ​​also supported numerous regional eSports events, received a record number of 117 eSports participants in the Motorsport Games and further encouraged adhesion by offering 12 -month subscriptions from IRACING to member clubs.</description><pubDate>2025-05-06 00:31:27</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Project for new track in Zhuhai emerges</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/automobilismo-surge-projecto-para-nova-pista-em-zhuhai/</link><description>With a very black cloud to turn to the future of the Zhuhai International Circuit, there is a potential good news for the great bay of motoring: a project for a new permanent circuit in the Chinese city adjacent to the MSAR.
According to Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper, Guangdong's provincial government recently published the document “Measures to promote high quality tourism and accelerate the construction of a strong tourist province”, which proposes, for the first time, the creation of an “industrial circle of culture and tourism of the Great Bay”, offering political support to the integrated development of culture and tourism in the region. With this, the first industrial and tourist complex of motorized sports in the Great Bay may emerge.
The project of the Zhuhai Chaoyue international circuit was recently presented at the Zhuhai Ocean Spring Resort, located in Doumen, not far from the city's airport, with an initial investment of 250 million Renminbis.
According to the first information, the project of this circuit provides for welcoming evidence such as Formula 3 and foster collaborative development between motorized sports sectors, cultural events and exhibition industry. The plan includes the holding of several international tests per year and foresees collaboration with Hong Kong and Macau to connect cities such as Jiangmen and Zhongshan, promoting “Multiple stops” and boosting the innovative development of “Event Economics + Cultural Tourism”.
According to Zhou Jian, China Travel Service (Zhuhai) Executive Director General Ocean Spring Resort Co., the FIA ​​grade certification-will also include a karting track, drift track and an interior space of 2,400 m² for exhibitions and events related to the automobile sector. With more than 50 international events projected annually, the goal is to become a "super IP" that joins running, leisure and tourism under the same concept.
The first phase of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit project will include international certification professionals, as well as support facilities. This project aims not only to fill “a gap in the high -end motorized sports sector in Zhuhai, but will also promote the modernization of the Great Bay's cultural, sports and tourist industries by conducting international racing and themed cultural events linked to motorsport.”
Uncertainties in the air
Last summer, the company Malay LBS Bina Group BHD announced that it sold its participation in the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) - the first permanent circuit built in the interior of China - by 124.7 million ringits (about 214.15 million patacas). In a statement to Bursa Malaysia Securities BHD, the group reported that their subsidiary, Dragon Hill Corporation Ltd, sold all his participation in Lamdeal Investments Ltd (Lil) to Huafa Urban Operation (HK) Ltd, a well -known real estate operator. Lil Detinha 60 percent of Zhuhai International Circuit Limited (ZICL), circuit operator.
Raised in 1996 in order to receive the first major prize of Formula 1 China - something that never materialized - the ZIC was still the initial engine of motor racing in the country and a reference in Asian motorsport. Since its opening, it has welcomed several international evidence, such as the FIA ​​GT, A1 GP or the Intercontinental Le Mans Series. In recent years, track administration has chosen to organize its own events, abdicating the most costly international evidence.
Despite having received, in the past, auto competitions from MSAR, ZIC has been losing protagonism in local motorized sport, due to high prices, limited availability and reducing sports activity in favor of the most profitable commercial activities. The future of the circuit remains uncertain: it is only known that lease agreements between resident teams and the circuit have been frozen and are not being renewed. The track approval will also be about to expire, requiring a new certification to continue to receive competitions in the future.
However, on the weekend of June 14 and 15, the still only circuit of Zhuhai will host the third race of the Formula 4 China Championship season.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 01:53:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao's historicals get a GP clearance</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/historicos-de-macau-conseguem-apuramento-para-gp/</link><description>The Guangdong International Circuit welcomed, last weekend, the second and decisive double journey of Macao - Macau Road Sport Challenge cars, proof of finding for the most important motor racing of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. In a journey with few celebration reasons for the colors of the sinters, the veterans Jerónimo Badaraco and Rui Valente managed to ensure the qualification.
With a list of 68 subscribers, the grill was divided into two groups, A and B, with all the pilots competing with Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8) models. This year, with only one race scheduled for the Grand Prix Program - due to the inclusion of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup - the number of riders was reduced to 36, which placed a supplementary pressure for both missing races. To complicate, the rain came, changing the turns to teams and riders.
In Group A, where Rui Valente faced a complicated weekend on the track around Zhaoqing, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão failed to qualify, in a series dominated by Hong Kong pilots. In Saturday's race, the podium consisted of Wong Chuck Pan, Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping. On Sunday, these three repeated the feat, but with a new order: Lo Pak Yu, Chan Ka Ping and Wong Chuck Pan.
In difficult atmospheric conditions on Saturday, Rui Valente ended only 25th, due to an error in tuning, improving to 15th on Sunday, with the track dry. A penalty after the second race fired him to the 27th place. Still, the 7th place obtained on the first round was enough to secure a place in the Macao Grand Prix.
On the contrary, Maximiano Mannão, behind the wheel of a Toyota with the colors of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended on 26th and 14th, a result below the finding, but it turns out to be positive given that it was Jove Pilot's debut in these wanderings. Célio Alves Dias, with difficulties in his car since the first race, was 24th and 28th, far from the usual level of this experienced Macaense pilot.
Badaraco with final sprint '
On a weekend, where the lively races were broadcast on live streaming in Group B, Hong Kong riders stood out again. On Sunday, Adrian Chung won, with Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin completing the podium. In the second confrontation, Cheang Kin Sang reached a deserved victory, followed again by Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin.
Jerónimo Badaraco came to this challenging weekend without the assured clearance. A modest qualification and 11th Saturday place maintained the open outcome. However, a solid race on Sunday and an excellent 4th place assured veteran Macanese the much desired place on the grid of the Macao Grand Prix, along with countrymen Cheng Kin San, Leong Keng Hei, Lou Check In and Carson Tang.
Also outside the Grand Prix was Dionísio Albino Pereira, who finished 23rd in Saturday's race, but closed the time more forcefully, cutting the line of goal in 13th place in the second race.
At the end of the races, competitors provisionally calculated had an extra technical verification, being forced to open engines and gearbox, to verify the legality of these two decisive organs of their vehicles.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:57:43</pubDate></item><item><title>GPM | Carlos Lemos presents volume II of his book in October</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/02/gpm-carlos-lemos-apresenta-volume-ii-do-seu-livro-em-outubro/</link><description>After the success of Volume I, Macaense Carlos Lemos, residing in Toronto since 1974, is prepared to launch, in October, the Macao Grand Prix-Victor H.'s personal collection, 1954-1978, volume II (1967-1978), the second part of a book that intends to honor his father, Victor Hugo Lemos-an enthusiast of the great prize of Macao that Life, collected a vast number of photographs and everything that was related to the car races in Macau since 1954, the date of the first edition of the event.
About the second part of the work, Carlos Lemos explained to HM that it will be “very similar to volume I, but contains more newspaper clippings in English and Chinese of each year, as well as some financial reports of the Grand Prix. It also includes a poster of the Jubilee Year, which I made three limited copies and initialed in Canvas, offering one to the Macau (Apomac) retirees and pensioners association (Apomac) Lusitano, as a sign of thanks for the support provided. ”
Docued with photographs of the time and newspaper articles, there are some of the most emblematic periods of the mashed event, such as the evolution of the guide circuit, the first victim (Arsenio Laurel, 1967), the birth of the Grand Motor Motor Prize and the Guide Race, the arrival of the first factory teams and the first sponsors, the first television broadcast in direct, and the attempted Hong Kong to create his own great prize itself. Also in addition to a new chapter, with "ten pages of another collection of my father, called Motor Racing World, with some copies of 1900, autographed photographs of pilots, leaders and personalities of world motorsport."
After releasing volume I in 2023, the presentation of Volume II is scheduled for October 15 in Macao and on October 17 in the neighboring Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong.
More and bigger
The truth is that sales of the first volume exceeded expectations. "It was really a success," the author acknowledges, because "there are only two dozen copies left, which I kept for myself, for offers and reservations, if someone outside Macau is interested." However, for Carlos Lemos, “the biggest success was to be able to raise more than 41,000 patacas for charity”, intended for the Macau IC2 [I Can Too] institution, which supports people with autism or disability.
For this second volume, with more recent content, the number of copies produced will increase slightly. "The impression of volume I was 500 copies, and I found it a little" tight "to get a satisfactory number to offer friends and certain personalities and entities linked to the Grand Prix. So I had 550 copies this time."
Carlos Lemos also underlines that "Apomac and the Lusitano Club of Hong Kong promised to support the launch of Volume II, which is very important." The book will have more pages - about a hundred more - and the author confirms: “I've received several reservations!”
Mission (almost) fulfilled
With the publication of the second volume, Carlos Lemos's first major goal will be fulfilled, because "my mission to honor my father is complete with regard to the Macao Grand Prix collection, though not entirely, because my father's biggest dream was to have his name in Guinness World Records."
This is also a curious story, as Victor H. Lemos has applied three times to Guinness World Records, to no avail. "God willing and all goes well, I will try once again, on his behalf, to present a new candidacy for the Guinness Book of Records and perhaps also to Fiva Hall of Fame." Fiva (International Federation of Old Vehicles) is a non -profit world organization dedicated to the protection, preservation and promotion of historical automobile heritage.
“This time, for Guinness World Records, I will submit the application with support documents, such as videos and photographs of the collection and books,” explains the former president of the Macao House in Toronto. "My father wrote only one letter without attaching any document, because in those days there was no ease we have today."
In addition to motoring, Carlos Lemos also reveals that he would like to “publish a book on the collection of matches of matches made in Macao. My father collected labels of matchboxes from around the world - has Portugal, Spain, several countries in Europe, etc. This project depends on the time available and the interest of people”. And we stay here for collections? Maybe not: "I have hundreds too, maybe thousands of old coins - so many that is complicated ... So I won't move (laughs)."</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 06:30:08</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Tourism finding races took place in Zhaoqing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/21/gp-corridas-de-apuramento-de-turismo-decorreram-em-zhaoqing/</link><description>The 2025 edition of the Macao-Macau Road Sport Challenge-Macao Touring Championship-began at the Guangdong International Circuit, with 67 cars divided into two groups, A and B, disputing a total of four races over the weekend. Hong Kong riders again showed their superiority, but there were positive results among Macau pilots
 
In addition to the titles at stake, the competition organized by the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), which is divided into two events, also serves to assign the thirty-six vacancies available to the most important race of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. As such, this first journey on the circuit of the surroundings of Zhaoqing was particularly tense, with very disputed races between the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8), all equipped this year with the new DMC compound pirelli tires.
In the group it aligned three well -known pilots of the Lusophone community: Rui Valente, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão. However, a less achieved qualification left the three in the final part of the starting grid, forcing them to redoubled work in the first race, played on Saturday afternoon. This same race was eventually interrupted with a red flag a few turns from the end, due to an oil stroke on the track. Damon Chan, winner of the competition in 2024, triumphed, followed by Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping, in a podium entirely composed of Hong Kong pilots. The experienced Rui Valente starred in an excellent recovery race, rising from 29th to 14th position. Maximiano Mannão won three places and finished 22nd, while Célio Alves Dias climbed eight positions, ending at 25th.
In the second race, Rui Valente again printed a strong progress, spinning 5th, but the degradation of the tires prevented him from maintaining the position, ending in 7th. With a scoring system that privileges the top ten classifieds, this result may be decisive for their qualification for the Great Award. In his weekend debuts to the commands of a Maximian Maão Tourism car, whose Toyota boasts the colors and the logo of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended in 15th. Célio Alves Dias, on a complicated weekend, was only 23rd and knows that there is a lot to do if you want to qualify next month. The victory was up to Lo Pak Yu, pressured closely by Wong Chuk Pan and Leong Keng Hei. The best representative in the territory was Lou Check In with a 4th place.
MSAR VICTORY AND TOP-10 to Badaraco
Group B races were also marked by uncertainty and great animation inside the track. Chung Kwok Hei, winner in 2023, led the race until a hole forced him to leave. Cheng Kin Sang, representative of MSAR, took the opportunity and took the lead. Bayern Yip Wai Hei has released several attacks, all effectively defended by Cheng. However, an apparent accident on the main line, near the end, caused a new red flag interruption. Cheng Kin Sang won, ending ahead of Bayern Yip and Lam Tou.
In the second race, Bayern Yip exceeded Cheng Kin Sang on the second round and took command. Despite Safety Car's entrance twice, Bayern Yip kept his calm and secured the victory, winning a first and second place in the weekend. Rao Long, who left the eighth position, showed excellent pace and climbed to the 2nd place in the last two laps. Cheng Kin Sang concluded in 3rd place, adding two podiums on the opening day.
Jerónimo Badaraco, the last winner of the ACP Cup, in 1999, had a discreet beginning, ending in 19th Saturday's race. On Sunday, “Noni” showed that he still has a lot to give local motorsport, reaching a precious 10th place. Already Dionísio Albino Pereira completed the first race in 29th position and did not aligned in the second.
The next, final and decisive journey is scheduled for May 16-18, again at the Guangdong International Circuit.</description><pubDate>2025-04-21 23:40:23</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
