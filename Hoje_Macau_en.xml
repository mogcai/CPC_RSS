Matlombe explained that he will sign the contracts today, one involving “direct financing” and another a public-private partnership (PPP), with the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) state group.
CRBC will build a road with almost 78 kilometers to improve access to Inhambane province in southern Mozambique, which the minister described as “an important tourist zone”. Matlombe has assumed that the cost of the project "will even be assumed by the state itself", since "there is no demand that justifies a PPP or a direct direct investment."
On the contrary, the leader argued that, according to a study already conducted, ”the road to Porto da Beira,“ from the point of view of the business model, allows any investor to recover his investment ”. The minister stressed that Porto da Beira“ is one of the largest in the south of the country ”and that the new access will be“ an alternative corridor ”that will facilitate, for example,“ the departure of Porto ”for the vicin.
Encounters in Macau
The minister spoke on the sidelines of a session of the 16th International Forum and Exhibition on Investment Investment and Construction (IIICF), which is taking place until Thursday in Macao. Matlombe has revealed that he already has at least five meetings in Macao with members of the government of Botsuana, Angola, Cape Verde and Democratic Republic of Congo (RDCongo).
On the table will be the logistics corridor in the North Zone, which connects Maláui, Zambia and RDCongo, to “capitalize the use of the port of Nacala”, said the leader. Matlombe revealed that the Minister of Public Works, Housing and Mozambican Water Resources, Fernando Rafael, also traveled to the region.
The head of the protection of transport and logistics said that during the stay in Macao, the government colleague "will also sign some agreements for the social housing mass for young people."</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 03:04:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Public Management | Totality of companies evaluated with notes above B</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/gestao-publica-totalidade-de-empresas-avaliadas-com-notas-acima-de-b/</link><description>The Directorate of Services of Supervision and Management of Public Assets (DSSGAP) has evaluated with positive note all MSar companies with public capitals.

Meteorological and geophysical services will be a sign 1 of tropical storm, the first of the year, this morning
 
Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) will be the first sign 1 of the 2025 Tropical Storm. In a statement published yesterday, when the storm was 810 kilometers from Macao, the SMG indicated that a “low pressure area located in the central seasion of southern China intensified to a tropical depression”, moving slowly “to regions between the island of the island of Hainan and the West Zone of Guangdong ”.
Given that the forecast points to the tropical depression to continue to develop in the coming days, due to its influence, “it is expected that the wind intensifies in Macao later this week”, and that the territory be beaten by frequent and thunderstormdas.
The SMG guarantee that they will continue to follow the evolution of the first storm of the Tuphal time, and appealed to the population that "paying attention to the latest weather information, adopting preventive measures in time."
Bonanza Times
Prior to the approach of the storm to the Guangdong coast, the SMG estimates that during this day the weather remains very hot, despite the descent of three degrees of the maximum temperature compared to yesterday to 32 degrees. The sky will be very cloudy interval of periods of little cloudy. The scenario changes tomorrow, with the thunder, thunderstorms and generally cloudy sky.
According to the China Meteorological Agency, tropical depression will go west at a speed of 10 kilometers per hour. Since predictions point to increased intensity, national authorities do not rule out the possibility of depression becoming this year's first typhoon. The point of contact with the earth is expected to take place on Friday.

The Hong Kong Observatory also announced yesterday that it would go today to the tropical storm sign 1 and that tomorrow would evaluate the need to increase the alert sign.
Speaking to the broadcaster RTHK, an official from the Hong Kong Observatory did not risk predicting the impact of the storm on the neighboring region, due to the multitude of factors involved.
"In addition to the distance to Hong Kong, the impact also depends on its strength at the time [where it passes through the region]. The cyclone's wind field structure will also affect the wind force and the amount of rain it will bring," said Sha Chi-Tai.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 02:48:41</pubDate></item><item><title>IAM / Portal | Update eliminates about 20 years of statistics</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/iam-portal-actualizacao-elimina-cerca-de-20-anos-de-estatisticas/</link><description>By eliminating the data, AMI caused access to information as to the one that reveals that in 2023 and 2024 there was a peak of animal slaughter. HM tried to get clarification, but had no answer yet
 
The Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) updated the portal with data on the number of animals slaughtered and took the opportunity to fail to present the statistics of about 20 years. HM tried to get clarification on the reason for eliminating the data, but despite an email sent to four advisers on May 25, until yesterday I had not received any response, nor even confirmation of receiving email.
In the past, before the recent update, those who visited the AMI portal about the number of slaughtered animals could not only realize the number of dogs of dogs and cats per month, but also had access to a history over 20 years.
The older data between 2003 and 2007 were less complete, as they only had the total of animals slaughtered without discrimination if the animals were canine or feline. However, all these data are no longer available, without providing any explanation of the decision to stop making the data available to the population.
In addition, according to the new presentation, it is no longer possible to follow the trends in the slaughtering of animals in the territory. This is due to the fact that they would have started to present the data by quarter instead of presenting per month.
General cleaning
The elimination of data arises at a time when the government argues to be implementing a policy of “capture, sterilization and adoption” of street animals rather than resorting to slaughter. This was a policy requested for several years by animal protection associations as an alternative to the number of slaughter. However, between 2023 and 2024 the number of slaughter grew.
The elimination of the data also makes the peak of feline deaths disappeared from the statistics recorded in the first half of 2023, when only 105 cats were slaughtered in six months.
In terms of canine deaths, the elimination of statistics shows how the year with the highest number of slaughter was 2024, last year, when AMI eliminated a total of 311 dogs. However, this number is less than half of what was happening in 2010, the year with the highest canine mortality according to the statistics erased by the AMI, when 718 occurrences were recorded.
In light of the new official statistics, the number of cat slaughter in 2023 and 2024 was 140 and 119, respectively. In terms of dogs, the numbers show a climb, with 220 slaughter in 2023 and 311 slaughter in 2024. In the first half of the year, there were 32 cat slaughter and 69 dogs.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 02:43:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Culture | Wu zhiliang wants background to ensure national security</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/cultura-wu-zhiliang-quer-fundo-para-garantir-seguranca-nacional/</link><description>The president of the Macau Foundation considers that the government must have a mechanism to ensure national security and patriotism in culture. As such, Wu Zhiliang defends the creation of a fund to promote national narratives in literature and the arts in general and the establishment of legal balances between freedom of expression and national security
 
Macau Foundation's chairman of the Macau Foundation, Wu Zhiliang, understands that the territory is facing challenges that cannot be neglected and that even in culture should be lower in defense of state security and nationalism.
In a speech given Monday in Beijing at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Wu Zhiliang defended the creation of a mechanism that ensures national security and the promotion of nationalism in culture and the arts. Thus, the leader of the Macau Foundation, who finances, among others, cultural projects, understands that it is necessary to create a special background to promote nationalist narratives in literature and the other arts.
To ensure that there are no violations of the law and the rights of residents, Wu Zhiliang suggested a bet on regional cooperation to gather efforts between Macao, Hong Kong and China's law schools. The objectives of the partnership would create a system of legal interpretation, with analysis of typical cases to define standards of balance between freedom of expression and national security.
The partnership could also be extended to other areas of education, for example, with the establishment of a platform for sharing education resources resource resource intended for national security in the Great Bay, with a view to promoting an immersive learning model.
Muscular response
The intervention in the cultural area is viewed by the president of the Macau Foundation as a way of responding to the challenges that the MSAR currently faces, indicated in Beijing, without specifically realized.
The official highlighted the social environment and cultural bases of the population as elements that not only demonstrate the effectiveness of governance in Macao, but guarantee national security through the deep articulation of social structure and cultural values. To this end, Wu Zhiliang highlighted the fundamental role played by the principle “One country, two systems”, whose success also depends on Macao's unique social environment, as well as the solid cultural identity. In addition to the application of the political principle, the official highlighted the improvement of the well-being of the population, the education system and the role played by the associative fabric.
Wu Zhiliang particularly highlighted patriotic associations, and their social service networks that cover the entire city, which promote activities related to national security. In this regard, the leader gave as an example the mobilization that the associations achieved, taking about three thousand people to participate in the sessions of public consultation, when changes to the law relating to the defense of state security in 2023.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 02:40:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Portugal | Luís Montenegro visits Macau and China in September</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/portugal-luis-montenegro-visita-macau-e-china-em-setembro/</link><description>The Portuguese Prime Minister plans to visit China in September, which will be the first visit of the Portuguese Government Head of Government since 2016, when António Costa was in the Chinese capital.

"It was scheduled for Macau. But one could not go to Macau because we have to be on 12 [June] to celebrate the entrance to Europe. How did we go to Macao?

"While I go to the United Nations, he goes to Macao, China. Because he has a visit to China that also was around Macao. Let's see if he can score, while I'm in New York, he takes the opportunity to go to Macau and China," he added.
Canceled celebrations
Following the cancellation of Portugal Day celebrations in Macao, following the fall of the PSD/CDS-PP government in March, and the convening of early legislative elections to May 18, no celebration of this date was not foreseen.
However, the President of the Republic and Prime Minister Luís Montenegro eventually celebrated June 10 in Germany, on Saturday, with the Portuguese community in Stuttar, before watching the victory of Portugal in the final of the League of Nations, on Sunday night, against Spain, in Munich.
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa made a state visit to the Popular Republic of China between April and May 2019, which began in Beijing, where he was received by President XI Jinping, passed by Shanghai and ended in the Special Administrative Region of Macao.
EYES IN THE FUTURE
Amelia António, president of the House of Portugal, considered that the view of Luís Montenegro Macau is more important than the visit of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, since the prime minister will stay in office, while the president is leaving. "In a way it is understood, it would be a kind of farewell from Marcelo, in the end of mandate. But, if it is much more important, from a diplomatic and political point of view, to come from a prospect of walking forward," said Amelia Antónia, in statements to Radio Macau.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>June 10 | Alexandre Leitão highlights the end of the waiting lists at the Consulate</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/10-de-junho-alexandre-leitao-destaca-fim-das-listas-de-espera-no-consulado/</link><description>Yesterday was held at the consular residence in Bela Vista, the usual celebration ceremony of June 10-Portugal, Camões and the Portuguese Communities.

The investigation focuses on pork and offal, both refrigerated and frozen, as well as fat and derivatives, originating in the EU.
Beijing began this measure as retaliation for customs imposed by Brussels on electric vehicles manufactured in China, claiming that state subsidies received by this sector create competition distortions against European brands. Despite tensions, in recent months there was a slight approximation between China and the EU, namely after the impact of the trade war began by US President Donald Trump.
European Commerce Commissioner Maros Sefcovic, who visited China in March, recently said that Brussels and Beijing "share significant mutual interests in resolving bilateral and global challenges" and stressed that it is "equally important to face differences."
According to the European official, the two parties are “working hard” to achieve advances before the bilateral summit scheduled for July, China, when the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Beijing and Brussels will be celebrated.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 02:53:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Works | Drainage network changes circulation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/obras-rede-de-drenagem-altera-circulacao/</link><description>Several roads of the territory will be closed to traffic due to the work of clearing the drainage network, in charge of the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI).

Cultural Introduction and Comparison
What is the implicit popular philosophy in Wu Cheng´en's West Pilgrimage (吴承恩) 1500 - 1582? This was written during the Ming Dynasty and published in 1570, about the time when the Lusíadas de Luís Vaz de Camões, the Camonian epic, would be edited in 1572.
In the western pilgrimage, we are looking for an imaginary recreation of a group of pilgrims, headed by the monk of the Tang Xuanzang Dynasty (唐玄奘 Xuánzàng), to conquer a new spiritual world, that of Buddhist religion, to which the Chinese should adhere to a better ethical-moral conduct for a much-diverted population of good teachings and conduct.
Those who lead the initiative to free the Chinese from suffering is, of course, the deity of compassion, Guanyin (观音 Guānyīn), always attentive to all distressed souls, ready to launch their help.
Already in the case of Os Lusíadas, composed by Luís Vaz de Camões (1524/5-1580), a journey is also narrated, but it is real, inseparable from spiritual and religious aspects, because made in the name of the universality of the Christian faith, but being inseparable from the concrete journey, which implies the very human and Renaissance conquest of a better world for people, in which the Portuguese can not the Portuguese Just survive, but command and imperate, because they are worthy of an old history and very valuable warriors. Therefore, the heroism of the discoveries, living in the Christian faith, but accompanied and protected by the Renaissance Belling that recovers the classic spirit and deities, such as the protective Venus, a loving deity that sails for the Portuguese, and the aggressive and jealous Bacchus, the god of wine who wants to lose them.
The west pilgrimage by the Chinese is performed in the name of collective liberation and salvation, through contact with Buddhist sutras; The Portuguese “pilgrimage” to the east is also in the name of a collectivity, saves souls and extends to the whole land, given the proselytist vocation of Christianity and globalizing merchants, as well as the navigators, Camões his poetic herald desires the spread of faith by a great empire built by Portuguese heroes, as read in the first resort of singing first:
The weapons and the barons marked
That of the western Lusitana beach,
By seas never of before navigadas
Also passed beyond TAPROBAN,
In hardworking dangers and wars,
More than promised human strength,
And among remote people built
New kingdom, which so sublimated;
That would be translated into Chinese by Zhang Weimi 张维民 in 19981 as follows:
威武的船队 ， 强悍的勇士 ，
驶离卢济塔尼亚西部海岸 ，
越过自古茫无人迹的海崖 ，
甚至跨越塔普罗瓦那海角 ，
经历千难万险、无穷战争 ，
超出人力所能承受的极限 ，
在那荒僻遥远的异域之帮 ，
将灿烂辉煌的新帝国拓建。
张维民 (译) 《卢济塔尼亚人之歌 • 第一章 ， 一》
Both pilgrimages are true poetic adventure novels, the Lusíadas in poetry, the west pilgrimage in poetic prose and poetry. In the latter, Bodhisattva Guanyin will subdue 4 monsters who will be the companions of the monk Xuanzang. Bodhisattva takes an embroidered accent and a nine -lap ring to deliver to the monk. The latter, if effectively fulfilling his 14 -year mission, escapes the wheel of reincarnation (Jenner, 1994: 60), and his disciples, disobedient divine forces falling into the human world, will be able to return to heaven, where they will again occupy divine positions.
Guanyin also delivers a band, which causes terrible headaches to the disobedient King Monkey (Jenner, 1994: 60).
The monsters and indomitable spirits are presented.
First Sun Wukong (孙悟空 Sūn Wǔkōng), by King's disobedient monkey transits the obedient guardian of the Buddhist religion. Guanyin will free this indomitable spirit, prisoner in the mountain of the five elements (五行山 wǔxing shān), as punishment for the disobediences they have no account.
Then a heavenly marshal who will pass the pig. He is Marshal Tian Peng (天篷 Tiān Péng) of the Milky Way, tried to seduce the Divinity of the Moon, was punished by the emperor of Jade with axes and condemned to exile on earth. Bodhisattva baptized him with the nickname of Zhu Bajie (猪八戒 Zhū Bājiè), which means "Pig of the eight abstinences," and gave him the name Buddhist of Zhu Wuneng (猪悟能 Zhū Wǔnéng), ie "awakening pork for power" (1994: 63).
There will be an ogre that will be dominated and transformed into a sand monk. Was punished for being a distracted heavenly general. He paid the distraction with 800 whipping, having been exiled to Earth, where he devours travelers hidden in the waters of the floating river. Guanyin frees him, baptizing him with the nickname "sand" (沙 shā), and the Buddhist name of Wujing (牾净 Wǔjìng), which means "awake to purity."
Follows is the son of the West Sea Dragon King who will be metamorphosed on a white horse. He was denounced by his own father for burning the bright pearls of the palace. Jade emperor punished him, suspending him in the air. He gave him 300 whips, letting him wait for death. Prince Dragon is freed to turn into the white horse of the Xuánzàng monk, or as he is known in Chinese, on the white-dragon horse, (白龙马 白龙马 Lóng Mǎ).
In the term of the pilgrimage, Zhu Wuneng spiritualized, ascends to heaven, being rewarded with the heavenly position of cleans. But there are more honors to the group of victorious pilgrims who led the Sutras to China: the sand monk will receive the title of Golden Holy (Arhat), the monkey will be named Buddha of the victorious fight and the Sanzang monk will receive the title of Buddha do Merit (Buddha Candana-Punya.) As well as the white horse will rise the heavenly dragon.
Proverbial popular philosophy
Among the pilgrims are, as is well known, the monkey and the pig that escorts the great monk and Buddhist translator Xuanzang [唐玄奘 Xuánzàng (c. 602-664) or Sanzang (三藏 Sānzàng), the monk of the three Buddhist treasures (Buddha himself, teachings or Dharma, the monastic order or Sangha), the monastic order), Mandated by Emperor Emperor Táng Tàzōng (唐太宗, R. 626-649) to go to the Holy Scriptures from India. These will be delivered by the historic Buddha that resides in the Pico do Vulture, because "there are many greedy and evil creatures in the east, which are bought to cause suffering to others, killing and fighting nonstop." (Jenner, 1994: 58). Therefore, Buddha wanted to distribute the Scriptures through the Chinese world.
In popular and proverbial philosophy, which today rushes from mouth to mouth, it is drawn to the existential duel, between two of the five pilgrims, very similar to that of the work Don Quixote, by Miguel de Cervantes (1547-1616), composed between 1605 and 1615, in which the author puts in dialogue two opposing and complementary characters, Don Quixote and Sancho Pança: Romantic, dreamer and even utopian, almost only skin and bone, as it is like an incarnate spirit; The second, materialist, realistic, pragmatic, a very strong and plump "feet".
Mutatis Mutandis Zhu Bajie, the eight abstinence pig, and Sun Wugong, the west -west -awake to emptiness, have many of the opposite and complementary characteristics we find in D. Quixote and Sancho Pança. To confirm it, be aware of some of the said proverbials associated with King Monkey:
1) The seventy -two transformations of the monkey king (七十二变 qī shí èr bàn)
2) endless mutations (千变万化 qiān biàn wàn huà)
3) great confusion in the heavenly palace (大闹天宮 大闹天宮 nao tiān gōng)
4) Infinite Magic Powers (神通广大 Shéntōng-Guǎnggdà)
5) Appears and mysteriously disappears (神出鬼没 Shénchū-guǐmò)
He has an infinite spiritual ability, which allows him to accompany universal movement and be in permanent transformation. It has numerous magical powers, learned from the best of Taoist masters, which enables him to successfully interfere in both the heavenly and earthly order, which is why he will be punished and only subjugated by the Buddha himself, which, tame it reveals it belongs to a superior spiritual and religious order.
After a five hundred -year -old punishment, inflicted by the Buddhism patriarch, will be able to join the group of pilgrims that will successfully introduce sutras and Buddhist teachings in China. Sun Wugong reveals to be a complex and multifaceted character, retaining and enhancing the best and worst of human nature in his portentous intelligence, challenging and disobedient. It has a lot of difficulty in dealing with Zhu Bajie, for the stupidity and lust of the partner, always ready to sloth out and surrender to exclusively carnal pleasures.
Zhu Bajie embodies some of the typical defects of human nature that are well revealed in the popular proverbial philosophy, as can be seen by some of the said mentioned:
1) Zhū Bájiè fails and never assumes his responsibilities (豬八戒上陈 Zhū Bájiè Shàng Chén)
2) Zhu Bajie is adorned with flowers (豬八戒戴花 Zhū Bájiè dài huā).
3) Zhū Bájiè is the mirror (CZHū Bájiè Kàn Jìngzi)
4) Zhū Bájiè departed by plane (豬八戒坐飞机 Zhū Bájiè Zuò Fēijī).
In the first proverb, there is the difficulty of the pig to assume guilt whenever it makes mistakes, and how to make mistakes is human, there are no accounts at the times when shaking responsibilities; Already in the second is denounced a very characteristic defect between the people, the vanity, that is, the constant need for ornaments, and not only from the physical point of view, because here not only counts the clothing but also the titles, positions and honors, in a total inability to strictly self -evaluate. In the third said, the physical and moral fealade, which attracts complaints from others, for the lack of composure and, finally, this expression is used when someone goes to the best, but in a worse way, that is, without dignity.
Finally, here are some more generally meaningful proverbs, taken from the west pilgrimage, who draw attention to the general evils of the world through the adventures of pilgrims, since, except Sun Wugong, others are very easily fooled by all kinds of monsters, demons, seductive spirits, etc., having great difficulty unraveling hypocritical behaviors in which they stumble through Journey, where they find “many guys to which they cannot see their hearts” or, in other words, abundant hypocrisy, as said (虚情假意 xū qing jiǎ yì).
Therefore, they are constantly involved in sarilhos or situations that “have no feet or head”, which is literally translated into Chinese by “unequal sizes” (七长八短 qīm tea bā duān). Now in a misleading world, pilgrims are those who with good intentions go with the greatest goal of saving China, so the group finds itself in the situation of “big ship, great storm”, or as it is said in Chinese, “great tree that attracts the wind” (树大招风 shūo fēng) in a world where when virtue grows a few centimeters, so wickedness increases several meters (， ， ， ， ， ， ， Give gāo yī chǐ, mó gāo yī zhàng).
Despite all the warnings, coming from popular wisdom and Romanesque adventures, the west pilgrimage and the Lusíadas end with the success of its protagonists, as the Portuguese expand around the world, Buddhism is introduced in China and all the characters in the poetic soap opera give rise to a proverbial source pedagogical.

Regarding the affected workers, the government presents numbers lower than those already mentioned by deputies and associations: 5,600. An impact on SMEs is still expected, but without a major consequence for banks
 
After much speculation, here is finally the authorities and operators have announced what will actually happen to the 11 satellite casinos operated in the territory. They all will close, and the Macau Game Society (SJM) Resorts and Melco have already defined the plans for what follows [see secondary text], which includes acquisitions of L'ARC and Bridge 16, as well as the transfer of workers and game machines.
The executive presented yesterday, at a press conference, numbers of workers affected with the closing of the satellite casinos below those already referred to by sector associations. It will, after all, will be 5,600 and no more than ten thousand as some deputies said to these entities, and from this cake, 4,800 workers were directly hired by the operators of the game, so if the satellite casino, they can be integrated into their paintings. The rest, 800, were contracted directly by the satellite casinos themselves. There are still 400 non -resident workers (TNR) involved in this process. With regard to Mocha Clubs, 300 local workers and 50 TNR.
Tai Kin IP, secretary for the economy and finance, said that "the data were collected by different means", but that the government calculations "are official". "As the other means came to this data, I don't know," he added.
Asked about the support of these 800 workers, the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, explained that "the owners of the satellite casinos have the responsibility to ensure the work relationship of these people."
"In the case of the 4,800 hired by the dealers, such as Croupiers or Treasury Employees, they can return to work in these dealers' casinos. In relation to 800, the concessionaires have guaranteed the government that if they have employment problems they can absorb them and provide adequate jobs on the properties of the dealers," he said.
Representative Song Pek Kei even talked about the possibility of about 15,000 unemployed, while Nick Law, in a plenary intervention, said that among the satellite casinos and associated stores, there were "13,500 workers", representing "4.6 percent of the total macao work force".
POSSIBILITY OF CONVERSION
Regarding small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) located in the neighborhoods that will no longer have these satellite casinos, namely in areas such as the Inner Port, Zape, Nape or Fishermen's Dock, the government predicts some impact but controlled. There are, in total, 320 stores that operate in the vicinity with 800 workers, and “about 400 workers will have another employment situation according to the reconversion of stores,” said Secretary Tai Kin IP.
Essentially, and after the government's surveys, half of the 320 stores "will be affected directly by the satellite casinos closure, such as the pledge houses, mobile phones, restaurants and jewelery." However, Tai Kin IP pointed out that there will be others that will not have a great impact on depending on sales to residents.
Above all, the ruler pointed out that this scenario may even constitute an opportunity. "It will be a challenge and an opportunity for the reconversion of stores. Traditional stores that have a close relationship with satellite casinos customers have to reconvert.
Highlight that Hospitality Consultant Savills referred in March that the satellite casinos closure would devalue the hotels in 60 percent and cause more non-compliance with the SMEs, with bank credit obligations valued between 25 and 39 billion.
Tai Kin IP devalued this scenario. “From the knowledge we have, the loans granted to satellite casinos involve less than 1 percent of all bank loan activity, and we find that the risks are very limited to the operation of banks. In terms of risk supervision indicators in the financial industry, such as capital flow and others, banks' behavior will be safe and stable.”
Regarding the SMEs, Tai Kin IP said that the monetary and currency of Macao is “closely monitoring the situation with the banks to mitigate the recovery of customers”, and the secretary in advance that in April, “ten billion patacas were injected to loans to the SMEs, attenuating their pressures”.
Asked about the timing of these measures, André Cheong said it is the right time. "It all depends on the dealerships' decisions and we now officially receive the decision. This is a problem that has to do with several casinos and a considerable number of workers, and we did not want that only at the end of the year they knew about their situation. With six months to finish the transition period we understand that this is the indicated phase to advertise," he said.
No impact on recipes
Given the budgetary revision for this year with 12 billion Patacas in the forecast of game revenues, André Cheong assured that the satellite casinos closure will not have a major impact on the overview of revenues.
"We made the budgetary review with less 12 billion patacas due to lack of consumption. We believe that the closure of satellite casinos does not have great impact on the game's recipes," he said.
The secretary also stressed that, as for the intention of SJM Resorts to purchase the enterprises Ponte 16 and L'ARC, the concessionaire "has to conclude this acquisition procedure until December 31, and if they cannot buy these satellite casinos [who operate in the projects] have to end."</description><pubDate>2025-06-09 23:32:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Pecunaries Checks | Former Beneficiaries defend better assignment criteria</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/09/cheques-pecuniarios-ex-beneficiarios-defendem-melhores-criterios-de-atribuicao/</link><description>Given the changes to the pecuniary reimbursement plan, HM has heard three permanent residents who will no longer receive the check because they do not reside permanently in Macao, including a macanese born in the territory. Arnaldo Gonçalves, academic and former Beneficiary, defends a better distribution of support depending on the income of families
 
The rules for the attribution of pecuniary checks will change and now it is really necessary to be 183 days a year in the territory. The exceptions are some and arrest with students from Macau who are attending courses abroad or residents to work remotely to Macau and who are enrolled in the Social Security Fund, among other situations.
However, many people will be left out, even though they have lived for several decades in the territory or even macanese born in Macau, that is, many of the members of the Macanese diaspora.
In the case of Arnaldo Gonçalves, a permanent resident resident in Lisbon, he lived several decades in Macau, having worked for the government and was a university professor in the area of ​​political science. Six years ago, he returned to Portugal, being renovated, and told HM that he was already waiting for the day he was going to stop receiving the ten thousand dates annually.
"This measure aims to give people a counterpart, given the difficulties existing in consumption and the characteristics of life. I don't live in Macau, and I think from the point of view of equity, the government has never been able to make a fairer regime from the distributive point of view, because there is no system of attribution from the income, and deep down there are multimillionaires that gain the subseck, like the pensioners, all," he said. This is what Arnaldo Gonçalves says "lament". "It is hard work to make an assessment of people's economic possessions, and so everyone receives the same as it is more practical in administrative terms," ​​he said.
Maria João Ferreira, macaense of gem, daughter of the famous poet Adé, will also fail to receive the pecuniary check. He says he understands, but also criticizes the executive's positions. "I was already waiting and accepted with all the tranquility. It is fair, since I do not live there and I have the chance to be 183 days. I thank the time of checks that was dismissed. I lived in Macau until I was 16, but I was born there and still have family. Even the pandemic was there every year of vacation. mentioned.
Maria João Ferreira, currently in the direction of Macao's house in Lisbon, says she was “shocked” with a very concrete case. "A few years ago, when he was doing his doctorate, he learned of a civil servant who did two service committees in Macao and was a contemplated BIR money and even told me, not just me, that I thought it was funny as he was there so recently, he was entitled to such a benefit," he said.
"This is what I think is bad. It is one thing to go to do a service committee in public administration, or two or three, but it was never, in fact, resident. It is, as it were, an immigrant, because it will only work. This is how I see things," he added.
Patacas Amealdas
For Arnaldo Gonçalves, the ten thousand annual patacas served as a “Management Fund” for trips to the territory, where he still has family and where he travels frequently. "I've never used this money for personal purposes, you know? But I think these changes are a good measure, justifiable, and I even think it's selfish, that I've been entitled to this support for so many years. There are other people who need it," he said.
In the case of Maria João Ferreira, the cash of the pecuniary check was also used for expenses in Macao and with trips to the territory. "I have an account in Macao, and when I went there, if I needed to buy the plane ticket, my sister said the money here, or this money served to fund my stay in Macao," he explained.
Sofia Mota, a permanent resident and former Maradora in Macao, regrets the absence of explanations for these changes. "It depends on what the pecuniary check is for, whether it is a way of distributing the wealth or profits of casinos to the people who are part of the territory, or have already done; either if it is a condition to be part of the territory. I do not realize the premise in which the pecuniary check measure is based, and depending on the premise these changes may be more or less acceptable."
The teacher considers that "it makes no sense that those who contribute to social security at their own initiative, as is my case, are not covered." "It seems that there is a first and second and second social security system. People who come to Portugal to provide family care seem not to be covered and yet are out of the territory for reasons of force majeure. What is meant by providing subsistence to family members, is not realizing the function of the check and the coherence of exceptions," he said.
Sofia Mota confesses that she also used money to "a management fund to go to Macau, or to invest in formation."
The first reactions
The changes to the pecuniary reimbursement program were presented at the end of May and report that three groups will be exempt from the obligation to be 183 days a year in Macao and thus receive the check. They are the residents under 22 in 2024 and where one parent meets the requirements for receiving the check; the beneficiaries of the disability pension and the beneficiaries of disability allowance.
There are eight other situations where residents may have access to the check. This is what happens when residents attend higher education outside the territory; When they are hospitalized in a hospital outside the sons, those who are over 65 and live in the interior of China or, even under 65, have health reasons that justify the permanence inside China. Residents who work outside Macao are also covered by the exceptions to an employer registered at the MSAR Social Security Fund and residents outside the MSAR who are responsible for the family aggregate subsistence.
These are also attached to the exercise of official functions outside Macao; the registration of domicile, work or study in the deepened cooperation zone; And yet the work done in the cities of large bay except Hong Kong that is left out.
Deputy Pereira Coutinho manifested against the changes to the pecuniary check referring to violate the Macao Basic Law, namely in article 25, which guarantees the equality of the residents of Macao before the law and prohibits discrimination. The article determines that "the residents of Macao are equal before the law, without discrimination due to nationality, ancestry, race, gender, language, religion, political or ideological convictions, economic instruction and situation or social condition."
More recently, the Macao Synergy Association publicly stated that changes to the pecuniary reimbursement plan in economic development are not in accordance with the wishes of the population. Ron Lam also criticized the executive for applying the changes “in a hurry” which only came to cause more controversy: “the government was in a hurry and applied a sudden measure, without making any public consultation, with only behind -the -scenes movements leading to the population to question governance,” he said. "Consultations with local associations were simulated, which only generated more criticism and caused more unnecessary controversy," he added.</description><pubDate>2025-06-09 03:15:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Environment | Macau registers a new maximum temperatures in 2024</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/06/ambiente-macau-regista-novo-maximo-de-temperaturas-em-2024/</link><description>The direction of environmental protection services yesterday launched new data on the environmental landscape in the territory, in the Macao Encounters of the Macao 2024. The data is not encouraging: last year a new record of maximum temperatures, more rain and typhoons were recorded. More electricity and water was spent, more garbage was produced and fewer recyclable waste was collected
 
Lame
The Government of Macao, through the Directorate of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA) announced yesterday that 2024 reached a maximum temperature record in the territory, and there was also an increase in typhoons and precipitation.
According to the Macau 2024 state report, the average temperature last year was 23.6 ° C, precisely the value that had been reached in 2019, the highest since the records began, in 1952. The average temperature of 2024 was 0.8 ° C higher than the average climacteric (average of 30 years, between 1991 and 2020), according to the document prepared by DSPA.
In addition, Macau registered 42 days considered to be hot last year, more 10.7 days than the climacteric average, 29 hot nights, more 17.5 than the average, and 29 cold days, less 10.1 days than the average.
Meteorological and geophysical services (SMG) classify as hot days when the maximum temperature is equal to or greater than 33ºC and the nights at which the minimum temperature is at least 28ºC. As for the days considered cold, they are those at which the minimum temperature does not exceed 12ºC.
"With global warming, the occurrence of extreme weather phenomena is increasingly frequent," said DSPA in the report.
In 2024, Macau was affected by seven tropical cyclones, known as tuffons, and for the first time three tropical cyclones affected Macao in November, the last month of the Typhoons, which begins in May.
According to the report, the region last year received a total precipitation of 2,029.2 millimeters, "slightly higher than the climacteric average." DSPA also said that since 1970, sea level in Macao has risen at an average rate of about 3.5 millimeters per year.
Also worldwide, 2024 was the hottest year that there are records and exceeded for the first time the 1.5 ° C above the pre-industrial level, in January the copernicus European service advanced in January. Last week, the world weather organization predicted that temperatures should continue to reach record values ​​by the end of the decade.
More people, more expenses
The DSPA report also tells that with the arrival of more tourists to Macau, there were also more waste and spending on water consumption, for example. "With the improvement of the economy, the number of visitors in 2024 increased 23.8 percent in annual terms for almost 35 million, having recovered about 90 percent of the pre-pound level. Tourist intensity also registered a certain increase, with GDP [Gross Domestic Product] climbed 8.8 percent. In addition, there was a slight increase in the population at the end of the year."
Thus, it is added, "in relation to environmental indicators, economic and population growth led to the rise of estimated local emissions of greenhouse gases, invoiced water volume, electricity consumption and the amount of urban solid waste, compared to 2023". "During the pandemic, there was a decrease in the various economic and environmental indicators. However, with the constant improvement of the economy, most of these indicators rose again," is explained.
With regard to the volume of invoiced water, in thousands of cubic meters, by 2023 the record was 89,164 and last year, 94.123, which constitutes an increase of 5.6 percent. Regarding electricity consumption, in millions of kW/h, in 2023 it was 5,740, while in 2024 consumption went to 6,030, plus 5.1 percent. The report also highlights the tons of urban solid waste produced, which in 2023 was 501,512, rising 5.1 percent last year to 526,979 tons.
Another worrying fact of waste level was the fall, for the third consecutive year, the volume of recyclable waste collected, which went from 24.5 percent at 2021 to 21.7 percent last year. Changed for kids, of all recyclable waste generated in Macao, only about one fifth are collected for recycling.
In the report, IP Kuong Lam, director of DSPA, indicates that last year, "with the ongoing economic recovery, there was greater pressure on various environmental indicators, while climate change became more severe." Despite the results, the official said that the objectives are "to encourage greater participation of the population in environmental initiatives and together to achieve the view of building a macao with low carbon emissions."
A question of gases
The report released yesterday by DSPA also accounts for the panorama of greenhouse gases (GHG) gases, and last year, a global increase of “about ten percent, including carbon dioxide (C02), which represented 90 percent”.
It also highlights DSPA that “the estimated emissions of GHE from the various sources have registered upon the same period (2023), except for landfill residues, and the most significant increases were verified in estimated emissions from local electricity production and air transport”.
In addition, it is stated that, in 2024, the main source of Emission of GHG and CO2 was land transport, followed by local electricity production, waste incineration, trade, domestic consumption and services. "The main sources of CH4 emissions [methane] were the waste deposited in landfills and the treatment of wastewater, while the latter was also the main source of N2O emission [nitrous oxide]," he stresses in the document.
DSPA clarifies, regarding the tendency of GHG emissions, that "after reaching the peak in 2017, local Emissions of GHG showed a decreasing tendency, year after year, having reached its lower value during the pandemic." However, with the recovery of economic activities and the great movement of people, especially "in the last two years, the estimated emissions of these gases has gradually rise again."
The air we breathe
Also with regard to air quality data is not encouraging, because in 2024 “the number of days with the average quality of air classified as 'good' or 'moderate' recorded in the six Macao air quality monitoring stations reached 88 percent, slightly lower than 2023”.
There was, in a total of the year, 15 to 34 days with “unhealthy” classification, and only two days obtained the classification of “very unhealthy”.
According to DSPA, “the pollutants detected in the air monitoring stations were mainly ozone (O3) and thin particles suspended (PM2.5)”, while “at Berma da Estrada station (Ká-Hó), the highest index detected all year round, classified as 'very unhealthy', was the O3 the main pollutant”.
Last year, July was the best air quality month, while October to December obtained the worst qualification according to data from Macao air monitoring stations.
The report also reveals that “in terms of compliance with atmospheric pollutant concentrations in 2024, average annual PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations recorded in the various monitoring stations were lower than standard values”, while “the average annual nitrogen dioxide concentrations (NO2) also set below standard values, except for Road Berma measures (Macau) and at the High Density Areas station (Macau) ”.
More optimistic data is also revealed “daily averages of sulfur dioxide concentrations (SO2) and the maximum averages of eight hours of carbon monoxide concentrations (CO) verified in the various stations throughout the year”, as “both were below standard values”.
“In all seasons there was a record of the maximum averages of eight hours of O3 concentrations to exceed standard values ​​in some days. In relation to atmospheric pollutant concentrations recorded in the monitoring stations, generally the average annual concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2, while PM10 and CO descended”, and “as in the road station season (Macao) Only in 2024 did SO2 and O3 begin to be monitored, no comparisons were made. ”</description><pubDate>2025-06-06 00:16:25</pubDate></item><item><title>June 10 | Alexandre Leitão highlights the end of the waiting lists at the Consulate</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/10-de-junho-alexandre-leitao-destaca-fim-das-listas-de-espera-no-consulado/</link><description>Yesterday was held at the consular residence in Bela Vista, the usual celebration ceremony of June 10-Portugal, Camões and the Portuguese Communities. Alexandre Leitão, Consul, highlighted the end of the waiting lists in the consulate and the modernization of some services, noting that Portugal is ready to promote stronger economic ties with the MSAR
 
After years when renewing the citizen card or passport could be a small major problem for Portuguese citizens to reside in the MSAR, since this subject seems to be solved. Alexandre Leitão, Portuguese consul-general in Macao and Hong Kong, proved yesterday to be a satisfied man to talk about the last achievements achieved in the operation of the Portuguese Consulate-General in Macau and Hong Kong, this regards the June 10th, Portugal, Camões and Portuguese Communities celebrations.
"After two years of intense concentration in the normalization of consular services, we eliminated waiting lists in the field of issuing citizen cards and passports," he said.
According to Alexandre Leitão, "users have returned access to 90 percent of services without prior appointment, we introduced electronic payment, we drastically reduce response and referral times after the admission of processes, and reorganize human resources and procedures."
The consul did not forget the consulate's team, "which is constituted, almost in full, by Macanese who have positively reacted to the successive challenges that have been presented to them", also noting that "in 15 months were emitted or renewed 55 thousand cards of citizen and passports, which also demonstrates the dimension of the Portuguese community of Macau and Hong Kong."
Portugal with value
Thus, the official said he could “safely say that the essential, from the strictly consular point of view, is done”, but intends to bet on the “deepening of Portugal's diplomatic, economic and cultural relations with the special administrative regions” of Macao and Hong Kong.
Addressing the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, Alexandre Leitão recalled that the ruler “has defended the acceleration of the opening and diversification of the economy” and that from this point of view Portugal has a privileged role to fulfill.
"Portugal has the same purpose, which makes us, once again, bridged in a common purpose: to grow and diversify our economies, internationalizing them for the benefit of our peoples. Portuguese companies are prepared to take advantage of the" most open and inclusive posture to intensify international ties and increase global projection and attractiveness and the renowned Macao as an international metropolis "," Since, they are aware of the contribution of Portuguese companies and workers to the growth and quality of Macao economy services ”.
The consul was still clear in saying Sam Hou Fai that "he can count on the Portuguese community to actively participate in the ambitious design of economic diversification of Masters."
Alexandre Leitão did not forget the last major Chinese investment in Portugal, namely in Sines, by Calb - China Aviation Lithium Battery, being “the largest of the decade”, which “demonstrates the confidence of large Chinese companies and the quality and capacity of Portugal as the preferential investment destination”.
Camões, the Great
Given that there are numerous celebrations of the 500th anniversary of the birth of Luís Vaz de Camões, Sam Hou Fai brought the Portuguese poet to his speech at yesterday's ceremony in Bela Vista. “The strong and deep historical ties between Portugal and Macau are already known to all, and are reflected on this day, because today is also celebrating the largest Portuguese poet who lived a few years in Macao and was part of the first moments of this historical meeting of two peoples.”
"It is never too much to remember that it is because of this centenary meeting of cultures, in this" outdoor window "of China, that the" uniqueness "of Macao arises as" the only place in the world whose official languages ​​", as expressly underlined by President XI Jinping," said the chief executive.
Sam Hou Fai has not yet forgotten the “commitment and commitment of the Government of MSA in the concentration of efforts to build a higher level opening platform”, as well as the “reinforcement of bilateral opening with Lusophony and promoting comprehensive mutual benefits cooperation that enriches and further widen the role and functions of Macao as a sino-illusion platform”.
The chief executive's words also referred to the defense “Macao's multicultural characteristics” and promoting “development in all strands, seeking to continually ensure and improve the well-being of all residents of Macao, including Portuguese communities in Macao”.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 02:30:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Cooperation | A look at the approach to Spanish -speaking countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/cooperacao-um-olhar-sobre-a-aproximacao-aos-paises-de-lingua-espanhola/</link><description>The MSAR was already approaching Spain, but the chief executive began to refer to official speeches the importance of cooperation between Macao and Spanish -speaking countries, as well as the usual Lusophone world. Analysts relate these words to the current panorama of relations between China and Spain
 
The chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, has expressed in some discourses the importance of having to establish economic and commercial relations not only with Portuguese -speaking countries, but also with Spanish -speaking ones. Last month, on a public occasion, the government leader stated that the territory has to "welcome foreign friends to invest in Macau and also to realize his dreams in Macao." Sam Hou Fai highlighted the area of ​​advanced technology, stressing that “they can come from Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries” because “as long as they are in favor of economic diversification, they are always welcome,” he added.
Moreover, after the inauguration of the new government, Tai Kin IP, secretary for the economy and finance, made, in March, a visit to several European countries, leading a delegation that passed through Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Monaco to deepen “international links and explore opportunities for cooperation”, according to official information released at the time.
This approach to the Spanish -language universe, in addition to the usual connection already established between China and the Lusophone world, can have several origins: the growing relationship between China and Spain, as well as the desire to diversify the economy by MSAR, say analysts contacted by HM.
“The interpretation of Sam Hou Fai Declaration is very objective and pragmatic and can be summed up to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Portuguese-speaking countries. But the fact is that companies and institutions in Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in response to this need for Macao. For cooperation it seems logical to me, ”said economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, former resident of Macao and president of the Friends Association of the New Seda Route (ARS).
According to the leader, “Macau is a pure market economy, is classified by the World Trade Organization as a free port with its own international agreements both in the economic, commercial, investment, financial, health, sports, sports, international relations agreements with various organizations. Therefore, the business in Macau is very free, and the part of the government of Macau is to promote and frame this opening”. "As Sam Hou Fai says, all companies and investors who bring Macao economy diversification solutions are welcome," he added.
To Cátia Miriam Costa, professor at ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon, and specialist in Chinese foreign policy and Macao, considered the HM that “this connection to the Spanish stems from the high -level official visits made by the Spanish government to China, that is, there is certainly one of the consequences of the repeated presence of Spanish diplomacy on a very high level, reinforcing the ties between the two. countries ”.
THE IMPORTANCE OF GLOBAL SOUTH
It is true that Beijing, in the words of President XI Jinping, has shown great interest in the approach of the countries of the so -called “global south”, where Portuguese and Spanish speaks, essentially. For Cátia Miriam Costa, here also resides another explanation for the change of paradigm in the field of commercial and economic cooperation.
"It seems to me that recent meetings with high Spanish political representatives have influenced this decision, along with China's increasing political investment in the global south where Portuguese and Spanish are, in fact, the most spoken languages."
For Académica, "the strategy of using Macau as a convergence point may be historically justified by its cosmopolitanism, but also by its traditional role in including the routes that connected Asia to Latin America." In addition, "adds to a historical perspective, a contemporary view for a region that needs economic diversification and benefits from this proximity to distant spaces, whether historical or culturally." Cátia Miriam Costa understands, therefore, that "Spanish can be seen as an additional value to Portuguese, without distorting the paradiplomacy strategy defined for Macao early on."
The inclusion of Equatorial Guinea in the Macao Forum cannot be ignored, as a result of its entry to the CPLP - community of Portuguese -speaking countries. However, Cátia Miriam Costa believes that this change has little or nothing to do with the inclusion of Spanish -speaking countries in the official commercial approach discourse.
"The inclusion of Equatorial Guinea in the Macao Forum stems from another circumstance, that of his participation as a member of the CPLP. In this sense, it was a logical step to its integration into the dynamics of the Forum. However and although it can count as a positive element in this approach, the leverage that Equatorial Guinea has in the Hispanic or Hispanic speaking world," he pointed out.
ASES BY ARE
Maria Fernanda Ilhéu also highlighted the fact that the only direct air connection between Macao and Europe will be for Madrid and not to Lisbon. “By chance, TAP or the Portuguese government have contacted Air Macau or the Macao government expressing interest in resuming this airline? I don't know, but I know that this connection will greatly contribute to strengthening the Spanish presence in Macao, whether in tourism, commerce or investment.”
The guardian highlights the complementarity factor of the air route. "Is the Portuguese and Spanish presence in Macau is incompatible? It doesn't look like, but it is competitive, it may even be beneficial if they know how to collaborate and gain scale in the Great Bay area, but Portugal has to strive more to their presence in Macau is not a historic relic."
Moreover, the economist does not forget the role that Portuguese foreign policy may play in this issue, with the removal of Huawei in Portugal and a closer approach to Beijing in recent times.
“Portugal's decision banning the use of Huawei equipment says mainly respect for the economic relations of Portugal with mainland China and it is framed by a fearful diplomatic relationship that the Portuguese government followed from 2019 to 2024, contrary to the Spanish diplomatic relationship. It should be noted that the Spanish Prime Minister visited China several times during this period and the Portuguese government alone was represented by the foreign business minister. At the Boao Forum in Hainan, with a brief pass for Beijing. ”
Thus, Maria Fernanda Ilhéu understands that between 2019 and 2024 “the Portuguese government and the Portuguese civil society were very conditioned by the American narrative of cold war and the formation of two antagonistic blocks, not knowing how to keep the line followed by 2019 to proceed with a relationship with China supported by the friendship and confidence of nearly 500 years of cooperation in Macau”.
The necessary work
For the economist and president of ANSRs, it is necessary to take into account the investments and business movements made in recent times to perceive the position of Portugal and Spain in this domain.
“The last major investment of a large Chinese company in Portugal was registered in 2020, and only now is this type of investment with Calb investment [SINE Battery producer] that is in the implementation and licensing phase. If we see the same type of investments in Spain from 2020 to 2024 we can record five major energy investments, by China Three Gorges and Huadian; Transport, Geely, Chery Auto and Envision Group; a major investment in agriculture by Yankuang Beijing Energy and also a major investment in the health sector by Worg Pharmaceuticals. ”
For the official, “a lot of work will have to be done by the new Portuguese government to develop Portuguese economic cooperation with mainland China and MSAR, but it will also have to be accompanied by Portuguese business fabric”, he summarized.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Budget 2025 | Government removes 12 billion from the estimates of the game's revenues</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/orcamento-2025-governo-retira-12-mil-milhoes-as-estimativas-das-receitas-do-jogo/</link><description>The advanced forecast in November by the executive, which pointed to 240 billion casinos gross revenues in 2025, was reviewed. The government now predicts that revenues have a break of 12 billion patacas, forcing the budgetary review yesterday by André Cheong yesterday
 
Yesterday were released by the Executive Council, the data on the budget review for this year, which happens due to the low forecast of the amount of gross revenues of the game, which depend, on large scale, the local economy and public revenues.
Thus, if the executive initially estimated that the game's gross gross revenues would be, this year, from 240 billion patacas, this value now drops to 228 billion, or 12 billion. Regarding the average monthly estimate, 19 billion patacas in gross revenues are now foreseen, because "the situation is not like the one planned."
In yesterday's presentation, the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, and also spokesman for the Executive Board, said that “after study and analysis of the current global economic conjuncture and the effective situation of exploitation of the game sector from the beginning of this year to the present moment, it is proposed that the annual estimate of gross revenues of the game will be reduced from 240 billion to 228 billion, thus serving as to Main base of the financial budget financial revenues, and that relevant budgetary revenue rules are properly adjusted. ”
In November last year, when Ho Iat Seng was about to leave the position of Chief Executive, predictions for gross revenues were 240 billion, taking into account the initial version of the budget proposal for 2025. At the time, the forecast represented an increase compared to what had been estimated to 2024, which situated the gross revenues of casinos by 216 billion Patacas, an increase of 11.1 percent. Given the gross game recipes in 2023, the estimate for 2025 was a 31.1 percent increase.
It is important to highlight that the new forecast below expected is an annual increase of only 0.5 percent in gross revenues, when the initial numbers translated into annual growth of 5.8 percent. In the first five months of this year, the game's revenues rose only 1.7 percent annually to 97.7 billion patacas.
Balance Guarantee
In response to journalists, the subdirector of finance services, Ho Silvestre in Mare, said the new calculations were based on the data provided by the Directorate of Inspection and Game Coordination Services (DICJ) in contrast to the first semester public expenses.
“In this proposed budget law we made an analysis of the global conjuncture and took into account a different model regarding the consumption of tourists in Macau. We made general considerations for these estimates and, according to DICJ, from January to April this year, an average of 19 billion and there was an increase to 21.1 billion (gross revenues). reaching the 20 billion [ragous game revenues, on average], so in the second half of the year there will be uncertainties. ”
"In this budget we intend to take a balance in expense and revenue. After an evaluation at the first half of the year, we can make an assessment taking into account the amount of 19 billion Patacas, and according to the current expense of the MSAR, we were able to get a more balanced budget," he added.
In general terms, and according to the explanatory note presented by André Cheong, the total amount of the ENGRICIAN INTEGRATED ORDINARY BUDGET for the 2025 economic year is 116.5 billion, when a revenue of the 121 billion patacas was expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to reduce the DSF's gross revenue revenue. The cut is 4.56 billion patacas.
In addition, the official said, only the reduction in the tax raised on the game, due to the break in gross revenues, translates into 450 million patacas for the administration. It should also be noted that budgetary expense within the PIDDA [Administration Development Investment and Development Plan] is reviewed to about 19.587 billion Patacas.
Budgetary expense rises 2.5 percent due to education and social support
The government ensures that, in the proposal for a budget for this year, the construction of a new campus of the University of Macau (one) on Hengqin Island will contribute, in part, to the increase in expense, around 2.5 percent, as well as “the increase in the budget in relation to subsidies attributed to vulnerable groups and investment in research and scientific and technological development”.
In the budget proposal presented yesterday, there is a approximate amount of 1.7 billion Patacas for the construction of the new UM campus, said the subdirect of Finance Services (DSF). In addition, at the level of scientific and technological investment was added the amount of 340 million patacas “for investments in the scope of science and technology, such as the acquisition of laboratory devices, to satisfy the measure and policies of the Government of Masters,” said Ho Silvestre in Mais.
"For construction is expected an expense of about eight billion patacas. As the campus is built on Hengqin Island, the cost must be calculated in Renminbis, which is about seven billion. This is the data we can have at this time," said the official.
Support for support
With regard to social support, the budget proposal for this year reveals an increase of 2.86 billion of Patacas in the expected expenses, as a way of reinforcing these supports. In total, the rise in expenses is 2.5 percent, to 116.2 billion patacas.
As for the preparation of the budget for next year, it is being prepared and the watchword is containment. "We are already elaborating the budget for the year 2026, and all services of the Government of MSAR need to consider more about their expenses, especially given the current conjuncture. In the budgetary elaboration phase we take a prudent and rigorous attitude towards the expenses," said the subdirector of DSF.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:29:05</pubDate></item><item><title>EU has to be “much more vocal” about Israel in Gaza</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/03/ue-tem-de-ser-muito-mais-vocal-sobre-israel-em-gaza/</link><description>Former European doctor Elisa Ferreira demanded yesterday to the European Union to be “much more vocal” about the boundaries that Israel “is surpassing” in the war against Hamas, defending an articulated voice of the community bloc.
"Europe, even because of all the defense of human rights, has to be much more vocal to saying to Israel that it cannot exceed the boundaries it is exceeding, and that current international agreements do not allow certain actions," Elisa Ferreira said in statements to Lusa after a conference at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau.
However, the academic noted that Member States have never attributed competencies to the European Union in defense that allow it, for example, to intervene with armament in cases of country invasions.
"That said, many countries-Ireland, Spain-they moved a lot, and I think there is a joint and joint voice to prevent us with a sense of impotence in the face of deaths that are absolutely unacceptable in the 21st century," said the former Minister of the Environment (1995-1999) and territorial planning (1999-2002) in the governments of António Guterres. Elisa Ferreira stressed that there have already been “there were some expressions of this will” by Lisbon and expects “to keep up”.
PEACE STEPS
In late May, Slovenia, Spain, Ireland and Norway, who recognized the Palestinian state a year ago, appealed to all countries to do the same compared to Palestine and Israel, as it is a necessary step for peace in the region.
"We remember that recognition is another step towards the implementation of the solution of both states and we appeal to the international community to take the necessary steps to make it a reality, among them, the individual recognition of Palestine and Israel by the countries that have not yet done it," reads a "joint statement."
Israel's retaliation for Hamas' attack on October 7 caused more than 54,000 dead, the destruction of almost all Gaza strip infrastructures and the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of people.
Elisa Ferreira wants to look for new partners like China
Former European doctor Elisa Ferreira defended Lusa yesterday that the European Union must rethink partnerships and look for new interlocutors, including Beijing, to keep “a great actor” on the international scenario.
"If there is an opportunity in every crisis, as I think the Chinese say, there is also an opportunity in this US leadership crisis, because it has shown us that Europe has to know where it wants to go and not lose control over its own agenda, and, on the other hand, it has to diversify partners abroad," said the former Portuguese minister in Macao, after a conference at Consulate General.
In the current context of instability, China “has to be a great partner,” said the academic. "China is a great power. I think it has always been latent, now it is completely affirmed, especially in future areas, in stories of new digital and environmental technologies." "For a long time, Europe wanted to be driving out of new clean energy, energy savings technologies, etc.; I think China, when it defines it, when it determines, when it is organized, accelerates with an unstoppable speed," he noticed.
In Macao at an invitation from the Institute of European Studies, Elisa Ferreira inaugurated yesterday the “conversations in the Consulate” cycle, with the lecture “Portugal: from the successes of the democratic Portugal to the crossroads of the present”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Public Management | Totality of companies evaluated with notes above B</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/gestao-publica-totalidade-de-empresas-avaliadas-com-notas-acima-de-b/</link><description>The Directorate of Services of Supervision and Management of Public Assets (DSSGAP) has evaluated with positive note all MSar companies with public capitals. On a scale of 0 to 100 points, there were no evaluated with a note below 70 points.
None of the companies got the maximum grade, but CAM-Macao International Airport Society and the Society for the Development of Macao Industrial Parks were evaluated with “A-”, which means a note between 80 and 84 points.
Most companies evaluated obtained a score greater than 75 points, but less than 80, which means a B+scale. This was the case of Umacert Investigation and Engineering Tests, Macao Urban Renewal, Macao, Investment and Development Securities Settlement and Settlement Center, S.A., Macao Science Center, Macao Orchestra Society, Macau Slaughterhouse, Macao Metro Society and TDM - Macao Teledifusion.
Finally, the companies with worst evaluation went to UmTec and the Macao World Trade Center, whose final grade was a “B”, which represents an assessment of at least 70 points and a maximum of 74 points.
The evaluation of the results of exploitation and operation results from the obligation imposed by the legal regime of public capital companies to evaluate these companies annually. Evaluations take into account different criteria, according to the nature and objectives of the evaluated companies.
"Among the indicators of the exploitation and operation performance assessment of the year 2024, the essential indicator for all companies was the management performance, paying attention to the rationality and regularity of establishing the governance structure, the completeness of the establishment of internal management regimes, the exploitation in accordance with the law, as well as the regularity of information dissemination," was indicated by DSSGAP.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 02:41:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Culture | Wu zhiliang wants background to ensure national security</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/cultura-wu-zhiliang-quer-fundo-para-garantir-seguranca-nacional/</link><description>The president of the Macau Foundation considers that the government must have a mechanism to ensure national security and patriotism in culture. As such, Wu Zhiliang defends the creation of a fund to promote national narratives in literature and the arts in general and the establishment of legal balances between freedom of expression and national security
 
Macau Foundation's chairman of the Macau Foundation, Wu Zhiliang, understands that the territory is facing challenges that cannot be neglected and that even in culture should be lower in defense of state security and nationalism.
In a speech given Monday in Beijing at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Wu Zhiliang defended the creation of a mechanism that ensures national security and the promotion of nationalism in culture and the arts. Thus, the leader of the Macau Foundation, who finances, among others, cultural projects, understands that it is necessary to create a special background to promote nationalist narratives in literature and the other arts.
To ensure that there are no violations of the law and the rights of residents, Wu Zhiliang suggested a bet on regional cooperation to gather efforts between Macao, Hong Kong and China's law schools. The objectives of the partnership would create a system of legal interpretation, with analysis of typical cases to define standards of balance between freedom of expression and national security.
The partnership could also be extended to other areas of education, for example, with the establishment of a platform for sharing education resources resource resource intended for national security in the Great Bay, with a view to promoting an immersive learning model.
Muscular response
The intervention in the cultural area is viewed by the president of the Macau Foundation as a way of responding to the challenges that the MSAR currently faces, indicated in Beijing, without specifically realized.
The official highlighted the social environment and cultural bases of the population as elements that not only demonstrate the effectiveness of governance in Macao, but guarantee national security through the deep articulation of social structure and cultural values. To this end, Wu Zhiliang highlighted the fundamental role played by the principle “One country, two systems”, whose success also depends on Macao's unique social environment, as well as the solid cultural identity. In addition to the application of the political principle, the official highlighted the improvement of the well-being of the population, the education system and the role played by the associative fabric.
Wu Zhiliang particularly highlighted patriotic associations, and their social service networks that cover the entire city, which promote activities related to national security. In this regard, the leader gave as an example the mobilization that the associations achieved, taking about three thousand people to participate in the sessions of public consultation, when changes to the law relating to the defense of state security in 2023.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 02:40:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Satellite Casinos | Davis Fong says fakes are due to the market</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/casinos-satelite-davis-fong-diz-que-fechos-se-devem-ao-mercado/</link><description>The academic Davis Fong considered that the closure of 11 satellite casinos is due to the operation of the market and the fact that the concessionaires and companies that exploit the satellite casinos did not agree on the exploration of casinos. The position of the academic, and former deputy appointed by the chief executive, was taken in statements to the newspaper or Mun.
From the optics of Davis Fong, the end of these spaces was mainly due to the mismatch of the positions between operators and the game concessionaires, as with the changes to the game law, companies that explore the satellite casinos are no longer paid according to the revenues of the casinos, and can only be paid through the so-called replacement contract, ie a fixed monthly payment.
The director of the Institute of Studies on the Game Industry of the University of Macao also devalued the impact of the closure of these casinos on the local economy, indicating that a period of transition to the satellite casinos is currently taking place, and that in the last two and a half years the possibility of closure was known. For this reason, Davis Fong indicated, many restaurants have moved Zape's location to Nape to prepare for the new scenario without these casinos.
Although he was known as a game specialist, Davis Fong did not hinder that even without casinos Zape remains an area with commercial value, and that traders in that area should think of new way of attracting other customers. Fong left as suggestion the development of night trade.
The former deputy also opined that employees of the satellite casinos linked to non-game areas will face difficulties in obtaining a new job, so they argued that concessionaires should find employment alternatives for future unemployed.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 02:37:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Portugal | Luís Montenegro visits Macau and China in September</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/portugal-luis-montenegro-visita-macau-e-china-em-setembro/</link><description>The Portuguese Prime Minister plans to visit China in September, which will be the first visit of the Portuguese Government Head of Government since 2016, when António Costa was in the Chinese capital. The news was advanced by Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who admitted not to come to Macau until the end of his term
 
The president of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, returned a return to Macau on Monday, but announced that Prime Minister Luís Montenegro is expected to go through the MSar in September during a visit to China.
The Chief of Staff of Portugal spoke to journalists in Lagos, in the district of Faro, where he arrived on Monday to the June 10 celebrations, which according to the original program would continue in Macao, a trip that was in the meantime.
"It was scheduled for Macau. But one could not go to Macau because we have to be on 12 [June] to celebrate the entrance to Europe. How did we go to Macao?
Interrogated if he will still go to Macau in his second and last presidential term, which will end on March 9 next year, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa replied: "No. Go Prime Minister, if you can, but further forward in September."
"While I go to the United Nations, he goes to Macao, China. Because he has a visit to China that also was around Macao. Let's see if he can score, while I'm in New York, he takes the opportunity to go to Macau and China," he added.
Canceled celebrations
Following the cancellation of Portugal Day celebrations in Macao, following the fall of the PSD/CDS-PP government in March, and the convening of early legislative elections to May 18, no celebration of this date was not foreseen.
However, the President of the Republic and Prime Minister Luís Montenegro eventually celebrated June 10 in Germany, on Saturday, with the Portuguese community in Stuttar, before watching the victory of Portugal in the final of the League of Nations, on Sunday night, against Spain, in Munich.
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa made a state visit to the Popular Republic of China between April and May 2019, which began in Beijing, where he was received by President XI Jinping, passed by Shanghai and ended in the Special Administrative Region of Macao.
EYES IN THE FUTURE
Amelia António, president of the House of Portugal, considered that the view of Luís Montenegro Macau is more important than the visit of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, since the prime minister will stay in office, while the president is leaving. "In a way it is understood, it would be a kind of farewell from Marcelo, in the end of mandate. But, if it is much more important, from a diplomatic and political point of view, to come from a prospect of walking forward," said Amelia Antónia, in statements to Radio Macau.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Satellite Casinos | Faom says it will help in search of a job</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/casinos-satelite-faom-diz-que-vai-ajudar-na-procura-de-emprego/</link><description>The Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom) ensures that it will continue to communicate with the game companies, the satellite casinos and the government, in order to ensure the necessary follow-up of employees who will no longer have work in the satellite casinos.

"It is essential, first of all, to the population of Macao," Cabrita told Lusa agency, on the sidelines of a Symposium on the 5th anniversary of the Hong Kong National Security Law, organized by the China Academy of Social Sciences, a reflection group ('Think Tank') under the protection of the Chinese (executive) Council.
During the intervention, the former governor highlighted several articles of the Macao Basic Law, including those that guarantee legal equality, civil liberties and protection against arbitrary arrests or inhuman treatments.
In 2020, following protests that originated violent confrontations between protesters and security forces in Hong Kong, Beijing imposed a national security law in the former British colony. Last year, the Hong Kong Legislative Council approved new legislation that complements this legal framework.
No comments
Eduardo Cabrita, who worked in Macau between 1989 and 1996, refused to comment on the situation in the former British colony.
"The essential thing is to ensure that what are the fundamental principles of autonomy and Macau as a space for respect for fundamental rights are assured," said the former minister, on the sidelines of the Symposium, which was attended by former Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-Wah and Macau Foundation President Wu Zhiling.
Recalling that he has not “experientially” to follow the current reality of Macao, Cabrita praised the work that “aimed to ensure the maintenance of a legal system based on respect for fundamental rights and a system of law originated in a Portuguese matrix, with principles as unique as the prohibition of death penalty or respect for fundamental rights”, which differentiate the special administrative region of the Chinese continent.
"This is the willingness of those who had responsibilities in the transition process, who worked for this future, who want to continue to follow and to want to be guaranteed," he said. The Basic Law, created on March 31, 1993, rules Macao since the transfer of Portugal's administration to China in 1999, under the principle of “one country, two systems”, which would allow the coexistence of capitalist societies in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in the Chinese communist regime.
The 'miniconstitution' translates stipulations of the Luso-Chinese joint declaration on the issue of Macao, signed by Portugal and China in 1987, deposited in the United Nations as an international agreement, in which Macau is allowed to “exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy Independent Executive, Legislative and Judicial Powers”, as well as maintaining “unchanged for 50 years and the way of living before existing ”.</description><pubDate>2025-06-10 00:13:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Natural Gas | Announced price descent between 4.49% and 8.13%</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/09/gas-natural-anunciada-descida-de-precos-entre-449-e-813/</link><description>The reduction in the cost of natural gas has been justified with the descent of international price in recent years and with Renminbi exchange rate fluctuations
 
Since yesterday the price of natural gas has been lower, with reductions ranging from 4.49 percent and 8.13 percent. The information was released yesterday morning in a statement by the Directorate of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA), which means that the price will be reduced for the second time in two years.
"In response to the descent of the international natural gas price in recent years and the fluctuations of the Renminbi exchange rate in relation to Pataca, the cost of acquiring natural gas to supply Macau has lowered. For this reason, the Government of MGI has adjusted […] the prices of sales of natural gas," he was reported. "Natural gas sales prices practicing for the four groups of customers had descents of about 4.49 percent to 8.13 percent," he was added.
In terms of the changes, the largest reduction aims at Group D of clients, also called “special”, which will benefit from a reduction of 8.13 percent, to 3.9825 patacas per cubic meter. Until yesterday, the price was 4,3348 patacas per cubic meter. The second group with the largest discount is Group A of operators, with a cut in the price of 7.39 percent, from 7,3190 patacas per cubic meter to 6,7792 patacas per cubic meter.
Regarding group B of non -commercial residents, the cut is 4.68 percent, to 6,4164 patacas per cubic meter, when previously the price was 6,7314 patacas per cubic meter. Finally, in group C, of ​​the large customers, there is a 4.51 percent cut to 6.3568 patacas per cubic meter, from 6.6556 patacas per cubic meter.
Price Changes
This is the second consecutive year with cuts in the price of gas supply. In early 2024, then -head of the executive, Ho Iat Seng, announced a price reduction of 3.4 to 5.6 percent.
"In recent years, the market price of natural gas registered at the international level has also maintained at a high level. However, due to Renminbi exchange rate variations in relation to Pataca, the cost of acquiring natural gas to supply Macau has lowered," was justified in January 2024, also in a DSPA statement.
"For this reason, the Government of MSA has adjusted […] the sales prices of natural gas […], entering the new prices in force starting today [yesterday]. Natural gas sales prices to practice for the four groups of customers had descents of about 3.4 percent to 5.6 percent," was added.</description><pubDate>2025-06-09 23:42:58</pubDate></item><item><title>In the month of sexual diversity, who do we preach?</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/no-mes-da-diversidade-sexual-a-quem-pregamos/</link><description>My intuition tells me that we are on the wrong way. We are entering a complex dark tunnel system, in a labyrinthine mountain, with little possibility to see light points. These warmths are still far from our reach - not before we cross the darkness and the winding curves that the rock naturally forms.
In the game between light and shadows, we lose ourselves in dichotomies that deluded us, judging us on the way to progress, unity, diversity and respect. Given what is happening in the world, socially and politically, empty theories arise - theories of those who think it understands the complex development system that is ours: the human. We are fish in the ocean trying to make sense of water, without ever having a state outside it.
June is the month of LGBTQIA+celebration, and the tension is palpable. Pinkwashing, i.e., marketing that takes advantage of social causes and civic for profit-proves to be fragile. The colors of the rainbow are no longer seen as seen last year or two years ago. Now defending the LGBTQIA+ cause can cause damage. In addition, social networks are filled with complaints, as if the celebration of homosexual pride required an opposite celebration of "heterosexual pride." As if being heterosexual were not already celebrated around the corner of the world, with full rights in love and union. What we see, instead, is a misunderstanding that only feeds more hatred, more prejudice - and in many cases more death.
We live in a schizophrenic world: on the one hand, illusion; on the other, the disguised rot. Both sides suffer from the same evils. Develop spaces to talk about sexuality-so that people better understand themselves and others-it seemed to me a natural mechanism for the normalization of the subject. However, the confusing and hateful information paths overpassed. How does Elon Musk's absurd theory come about? What empathy destroys civilizations? And love - also destroys them? Is this natural act that leads to sex and procreation is not based on this intimate and simple relationship of empathy? We are lost.
Resting in the trenches of the battle of ideas, there is still hope - hope that certain ideas do not have to be defeated by others. In Thailand, in January this year, same-sex marriage was legalized. In Hong Kong, news agencies celebrate homosexual unions - impossible in China, Macao or Hong Kong - that find in other Southeast Asian countries the possibility of acceptance.
I have reflected a lot on how to reach those who need to review in a friendly word, and to understand that the freedom to be is a human right. There are many lives at this time, whose value is minimized - as if one life was worth less than another. In the month of sexual and gender diversity, where the sense of the right to existence reigns, I want to honor the decreasing people, who are erased, raped and killed for the worst reasons. From Palestine to the rest of the world.
I don't know if I'm preaching to fish, converts, or simply to anyone. But if these words come to the eyes of those who need it, I am satisfied. There are no revolutionary fantasies here - just the belief that one must be on the side of understanding and empathy. The mechanism that has allowed the progress of societies to this day.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 03:00:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Michael Hui (i)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/10/michael-hui-i/</link><description>After the film star Tony Leung Chiu-Wai (梁朝偉) received two doctors Honoris causes last year, another artist was awarded the same distinction this year. This time, the honor was up to Michael Hui Koon-Man (許冠文), known as “Poker-Faced comedian” (冷面笑匠).
Michael Hui Koon-Man was born in Guangdong Province (廣東省) in 1942 with 82 years old. In 1977, he began working for the Hong Kong Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) featuring the program “Hui Brothers Show” (雙星報喜) in partnership with his brother, the famous singer Sam Hui (許冠傑).
Subsequently, Michael was discovered by director Li Han-Hsiang (李翰祥) who invited him to play the protagonist of the movie “The Warlord” (大軍閥), thus joining the film industry. Between 1974 and 1981, Michael wrote, directed and acted in five films: “Gamblers Play” (鬼馬雙星), “The Last Message” (天才與白痴), “The Private Eyes” (半斤八兩), “The Contract” (賣身契) and “The Security Unlimited” (摩登保鏢), all huge box office successes at the time. These deeds checked Michael a relief position in the film industry. Subsequently, Michael continued to win prizes.
In 2022, he received the career award at the 40th edition of Hong Kong's film awards. In 2023, he received the best secondary actor award at the 41st edition of that event. Later, in 2024, he was handed over the Hong Kong Director Union award. Recently, the movie “The Last Dance” (破地獄) obtained a revenue of over $ 100 million, returning to catapult it to the pinches of fame and fortune.
Michael received many awards, which means that it deserves to be distinguished with a doctorate Honoris Causa. Why did you get so successful in the film industry? Let's look for the answer in your work.
Michael Hui Koon-Man has been a cinema and television star since 1977, that is, about 50 years ago. When a person dedicates 50 years of his life to a career, he demonstrates dedication, enthusiasm and recognition for the profession. Enthusiasm can not only exist in the present, it must also project in the future. Michael says that if he had a second life, he would want to pass it on in movie studios. In the speech given by Tony Leung Chiu-Wai when he won a prize last year, let us remember that he said he fully believes that enthusiasm is an important factor for success.
In the age that preceded the mobile phones, Michael always had a pen and notebook, in which he took a note of all the anecdotal situations he witnessed and then became part of the material he used in the movies. When he said the notes, he decided what situations would make the public laugh and those they would not do. The amazing fact is that Michael is not laughed. Therefore, there was the nickname of “Poker-Faced comedian” (comedian of the wooden face).
His films also reflected the attention that gave the evolution of society. He knew the difference between the mentalities of the oldest and most recent generation and used this knowledge to provide joy to audiences. In the “talk show 2005” we found some dialogues about love like these I transcribe:
“In the past, all love songs were like this:
“Our hearts are linked to each other, even separated by thousands of kilometers, our love never changes” (心兩牽, 萬里阻隔相思愛莫變),
“I think of you every night and I call your name kindly” (夜夜念奴嬌, 輕輕把名叫),
But today, in romantic songs it seems to lack love:
“Looking back, I was never happy with you” (回頭望, 伴你走, 從來未曾幸福過),
"Being a cat, being a dog, not being a lover, being a pet can be charming." (做隻貓, 做隻狗, 不做情人, 做隻寵物可會迷人)
These right observations brought Michael a multitude of applause. The applause of the public demonstrates the recognition of society through the points of view and the analysis of Michael Hui Koon-Man.
Next week, we will continue to analyze the factors that determined the success of their films.

Hollow words that do not contribute to Portugal the serious problem of housing, especially the social, has a light at the bottom of the tunnel. Portugal is the country in Europe where the price of houses has increased. It is very motionless, but they are luxury condominiums, with access to rich only. The housing intended for affordable incomes is always focused on calendar.
And who suffers more from this decision -making inertia of the rulers are the poor and the young. These are still 40 years old living at their parents' home. Young people have no possibility of renting a house in Lisbon or Porto. Its secondary course ends and when they decide to go to a university in Lisbon it is absolutely impossible for them to lease a house and student homes are minimal and expensive. Do you know what happens in Lisbon? Young college students are exploited in an infamous way.
In the Capital Lisbon there are hundreds of owners of old houses that were built with six and seven bedrooms. Therefore, it turns out that these landlords rent the six or seven rooms to students for 500 and 600 euro a month and in the house there are only two bathrooms for all. Even worse is that explorers do not even pass receipts and escape the tax authorities regarding the approximate income of 4200 euros per month, if it is a six -room residence. Exploration and deplorable opportunism is fundamentally due to the lack of affordable housing, with the aggravation of being the parents of students paying the use of these rooms.
Where is institutional inspection? Of course we do not believe that it will not be possible to find out where these homes that explore the students exist. Only on a Lisbon avenue we were aware that there are more than 20 homes with students rented to students. This is a situation that the new government could consider creating a group, like ASAE, dedicated exclusively to the irregularities committed and the exploration of young people who need a bed and a table to be students in college.
The housing problem is also the decrease in birth rates. Obviously young people are unable to unite, contract family and live to think that the future is a problem. If they stay in their parents' homes, how can they acquire or lease a house to live with their mate and children who may be born? Impossible. We wrote with knowledge of the cause because we kept a chat with a young student from the Faculty of Letters who told us that he lives in a room of a residence with six more habitatures, all rented by 600 euros. And he stressed that the landlord reported that if he intended receipt Pecúlio to pay would have to be 750 euros. Deplorable.
Another serious problem that is registered in cities such as Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra, Braga and Évora, among others, is the situation of women who are hired by employment agencies in order to be elderly people with reduced mobility or various types of dementia. These women, namely Portuguese, Brazilian and African, receive a salary when they receive less than half of what the contractor pays to these employment agencies. It is usually the children of these seniors and patients who pay, for example, 3000 euros per month and AMA workers receive the equivalent of the minimum wage. Many of them work on Saturdays and Sundays without being paid to double as the law requires.
Sometimes they are women who live with family difficulties who have a job but will work on the weekend to raise some more money that helps in their survival. AMAs who have annual contract to work from Monday to Friday do not have any payment of Christmas allowance. Once again, we do not believe that the government is not aware of this reality and seeks to end with this kind of shameful exploitation. We all know how difficult it is to deal with day and night an elderly with dementia or that needs a wheelchair to move. These nominations still do extra jobs in the houses where they work, such as cooking, washing clothes and ironing, without any more remuneration.
There are still cases where the elderly have pets and there are the exploited nominations that have to treat the animals and take them to the street. This type of exploitation, in our understanding, is just a new kind of slavery. This is what it is, with the rulers to whistle aside. Two relevant cases that would be deserving of a radical change so that the “Chicos-Parts” did not think that the world is those who exploit and enslave their fellow man.</description><pubDate>2025-06-09 03:54:06</pubDate></item><item><title>The meteorological systems of early alert and their importance</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/06/os-sistemas-meteorologicos-de-alerta-precoce-e-a-sua-importancia-2/</link><description>(Continuation of the June 5th edition)

Thus, the reasons for such a large number of victims, besides the exceptional violence of the typhoon and flood risk maps were outdated, was the fact that the terms “Storm”, likely to be understood by much of the less educated population, were used. Among the recommendations expressed in the reports of the various missions in charge of evaluating the consequences of the typhoon excelled the need to urgently update the flood risk maps and the use in warning bulletins, less technical language in order to be easily understood by the populations.
The Philippines, and some international media, reported that the president of the Guiuan2 municipality, the first Filipine city that was on the forecast of the typhoon, sent messengers with altifalantes, in motorcycles, to the various “Barangays” 3 of the municipality near the coast, warning the approach of a tsunami. The term "tsunami", although not technically correct in this situation, warned the populations, poorly sensitized by the forecast of a storm tide, to follow the instructions of the Civil Protection Authority in order to be evacuated, which was successfully achieved.
It should be noted that people were well aware of the consequences of tsunamis, as news about the consequences of such a phenomenon that had occurred a few years earlier, in 2004, on the west of Sumatra, causing approximately 230,000 deadly victims in 14 different countries.
The WMO and the United Nations Office to reduce the risk of disasters (UNDRR) 5 have insisted on the need to enlarge this type of early alert systems to other phenomena, in addition to those related to meteorology. Thus, the concept of early warning systems of multiple risks (internationally known as “Multihard Early Warning Systems”-Mhews), which cover various types of risks, considering interrelationships between them. The main risks that may be a reason for issuing multirriscos are essentially flooding, extractic cyclones, tropical cyclones (cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes), storm tides, droughts, forest fires, heat waves, landslides, seismos and tsunamis.
According to the report “Global Status of Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems 2024”, prepared by OMM and UNDRR (presented at COP29 by the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres), countries with less developed systems have a mortality rate related to natural disasters of nearly six times higher than countries in which multirristers are most Advanced, and almost four times more people affected by catastrophes.
It is expected that in the next conference on the climate, to be held under the auspices of UNFCCC6 (COP30-November 15-21, 2025, in Belém, Brazil), measures to improve early alert systems in countries where they are not properly implemented.

The party is scheduled for the Macao Tower multipurpose space, on the 21st and 22nd of this month, from 14:30 to 22h.
According to a note from the organization, like what happened last year, there will be “handicraft tents, snacks and games, with a lot of music provided by local bands”. The camp is from the initiative of the Macanese Association (ADM) with the Macau Foundation allowance, with the logistical support of the Tower of Macau, the collaboration of other associations such as the Association of Macanese Youth (AJM), the Macaenses Instruction Promoter Association (APIM), the Casa de Portugal in Macau (CPM), the International Institute of Macao (IIM).
The camp, more than a party in honor of a popular saint, corresponds to a community effort to maintain the tradition of celebrating the historical date of June 24, 1622, in which, by blessing from St. John, the population of Macao resisted and defeated the Dutch expeditionary force, preserving Macao with its own characteristics. This date was marked for centuries, such as Macao City Day.

The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) today presents, from 18h, the exhibition “Metamorphoses”, by Lúcia Lemos, which makes a retrospective of its artistic path, with works and compositions of different genres. The event is inserted in the program of the festivities of “June, Portugal's month at MSAR”.
“Metamorphoses” brings together 44 pieces that link diverse artistic expressions and aesthetics, such as engraving, photography, installation, painting and ceramics. Lucia Lemos uses organic materials to body ideas, and meanings to her art, in the different languages ​​and forms she has been experiencing and learning throughout life, now with greater freedom and time to explore.
The show emerges from “lived transformations and personal visual observations of the physical space - Macau - where I allowed myself to contaminate, never fail to practice portugality, as a sense of belonging from the place from which I departed four decades ago”, reflects the artist, cited in a FRC note. Lúcia Lemos recently retired from the Creative Macau project that founded in August 2003.
A kind of symbiosis
According to Lúcia Lemos, the retrospective that now exposes to the public also means the symbiosis of construction and maturation of its “identity, modeled by the changes in adaptation and adoption to the metamorphosis of the new place”.
"Art and the artistic process are seeking forms of integration and connection of the human being into the nature and the world around him," he added.
Lúcia Lemos built a professional career that crossed various arts and aesthetics, having started by obtaining an arts management diploma in 2001. Subsequently, he installed the Creative Macau Center for Creative Industries, which coordinated for over 20 years, and launched the Macao International Short Festival.
Participated in more than 50 collective exhibitions in Macau and other places, with some award -winning works and varied artistic languages. Since 2002, he has individually displayed black and white photography in Berkeley, Curitiba, Lisbon, Macau, Monza, Palermo, Porto, Salzburg and Shanghai.

In an interview with HM, the musician reveals that he will play Macao something completely different from the albums, which he began to release in his own name 11 years ago. On Friday acts in Macao in the scope of a tour of the great bay, on a night that will also be animated by three DJs: Sound of Silva, Oba and Tongrim
 
Here comes another musical proposal integrated in the June 10th celebrations poster - Camões Day, Portugal and the Portuguese Communities. The proposal is starred by Portuguese musician Bruno Pernadas, who comes to Macau, Hong Kong and southern China, namely Shenzhen and Zhuhai, under the “Greatest Bay Area Tour 2025”. On Friday, the musician will act at the Red House Space, at Ascott, from 20:30, accompanied by the performances of DJs Sound of Silva, Oba and Tongrim.
In conversation with Bruno Penadas, the musician explains what the Macau audience can see and hear. “The music that I bring to this tour is not quite the music that is available on platforms [digital streaming], and in stores to listen to. The concert I am going to do is solo, and I in solo stings that are not in the discs. I can even play one or another song, but it is a different proposal, is more experimental, has more jazz and character characteristics too. of the concerts with formations, ”he says.
Bruno Pernadas graduated in jazz at the Lisbon School of Music, studied at Hot Club, teaches and looks at music in a global way, without distinctions. He has already taken over an interview that does not consider himself a singer, something that has to do with the cross -sectional form as he faces the music.
"This has to do with how I hear music since childhood, which is a little different from most people I have known. I can't and make myself confusion to associate musical styles and genres. As I hear music from all genres, for me it is as if there was no genre, because the genre is being music, one language," he explained.
Asked about the difference between what is recorded and played live, Bruno Pernadas explains that he always seeks to establish “a relationship”, because he makes “very different music, also within classical music, and also with film and dance music”. "This song is completely different from what is in the albums, but it is a project that I like a lot and I have even made digressions in Portugal with this solo project and a guest, most of the time," he explained.
Records that regrets
Bruno Pernadas has made many wanderings in music, producing soundtracks for movies, strengthening their connection to cinema. In this field, the soundtrack of “Patrick”, a film by Gonçalo Waddington. As a producer, he worked with Margarida Campelo in “Supermarket Joy”, released in 2023. But in his own name he started 11 years ago: in 2014 he launched “How Can We Be Joyful in A World Full of Knowledge”, followed by “Worst Summer Ever” released in 2016 and, in the same year, “Thos Who Throw Objects at the Crocodiles Will Be Asked to Retrieve Them ”, which completed the trilogy.
More recently, in 2021, Bruno Penadas launched "Private Reasons". Today he looks back “positively”, explaining that last year he joined the team to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first album release in his own name, with a tour.
"How Can We Be Joyful in A World Full of Knowledge" took a year and a half to record and, according to Bruno Penadas, gave him a language that he only realized "when the album was finished." "During the process I didn't know very well how it was going to be the end result. I knew, more or less, where I had to go to get there, but I didn't really know how it was going to be. Then I knew it was going to make another album to continue this language that had invented, because it is a mixture of several languages, but it is not forced.
Bruno Pernadas assumes that when he played last year songs from the first three albums he made in his own name, he found that there were songs that no longer made sense of him. "When I had to do the exercise of reproducing live, there were many things that I no longer identified. Some songs, from start to finish. They had melodic components closer to pop or folk music that no longer tell me much, and then made sense," he said.
The musician even says that the album released in 2021, in the middle of pandemic, “Private Reasons” is the work that today tells you less. "It's very pop. With this that I don't identify at all, and it's much more recent than the first. There are strange things that happen." Bruno Pernadas even says that there would be songs of “Private Reasons” that would not even record today, namely track 4, “Theme Vision”, which was even entitled to music video. “I can be sure I would never release 'Theme Vision',” he said.
Studio and Stage
Bruno Pernadas takes over: "I don't even like to be in the studio." "In fact, I really like the creative process and when you can find the result. During my life I avoided going to studios, and I only go when it is really accurate. Only the idea of ​​those producers and composers, who are more producers, who are in a studio without windows for half his life, for me it is not unthinkable. I was unable to work in a place with the daylight," he said.
There is, however, one thing that Bruno Pernadas likes a lot: of cinema, establishing a deep connection with the music he makes. “I think of discs like movies, but it's not like music for a movie. It's really like movies, when I think of a group of people who are going to participate in the album. When I'm writing part of a song I already know it's that person who will record and play, and I'm already writing for her, just as some directors write to a particular actor.”
“Since I am a child I go to the movies, and I know that there are directors who usually think they perceive more of cinema than everyone else, but this is a mistake, because in my case, I don't think you realize more music about other people. Of course, according to a technical language, I keep this knowledge,” he said.
Before acting in Macao, Bruno Pernadas passes the city of Shenzhen on Thursday, followed by shows in Zhuhai and Hong Kong, the latter on Sunday. Regarding the neighboring region the musician says he has “a lot of curiosity”, even for the cinema, especially the work of director Wong Kar Wai. “I've always seen more movies in Cantonese. Cinema made in China, I only know the great classics,” he said.
The work of Bruno Pernadas is known in Japan, and in this tour the Portuguese musician also is present in the country. "What happened is that my records started going out in some magazines in Japan and, after a short time, the largest distributor in the country wanted to start distributing my records. And so began this story that is over. Then I proposed to make a concert. I've been twice in Japan, but this time I will play at Expo Osaka 2025," he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-06-10 00:09:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Creative Macau | New Miguel Quental exhibition with images of Goa</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/09/creative-macau-nova-exposicao-de-miguel-quental-com-imagens-de-goa/</link><description>After the first photography exhibition at the University of Macau, Miguel Quental again shows images of his own, but this time about Goa. The show is welcomed from Saturday at Creative Macau and intends to show the public the “rich inheritance of vibrant color” of a territory that once was the “capital of an empire”
 
Creative Macau hosts, from Saturday, a new exhibition by Miguel Quental, better known for his work in law, but this time presents his images taken in Goa. “Colors of Goa” is the name of the exhibition that opens from 6.30 pm on Saturday, presenting images of what was “capital of an empire”, from which “a rich inheritance of vibrant colors, aromas, flavors, images and beliefs that transcend our imagination”, describes the author of the photos, quoted by a Creative Macau statement.
“In search of this legacy, I left for Goa, but the experience went far beyond what I could expect. Its ancient churches and other places of worship exhibit a captivating beauty, offering a unique and transcendent peace that goes beyond the spirituality to which they are dedicated. The manorial houses, full of history, details and emotion, resemble noble, majestic and impassible, full of art and memories.” It also describes.
Miguel Quental does not forget either “the alleys of Velha Goa, Pangim, Margão and the Fontaínhas neighborhood, which breathe and offer us a vibrant and almost magnetic heritage that touches the soul and invites us to go beyond the historical and cultural memories that memory does not allow us to forget”. "In this spirit, I share some of the many images I took there, but I'm aware that much more to find out," says the author, who hopes that she will "invite her to visit her soon."
I like the image
Residing in Macao since 2002, Miguel Quental has been in the third individual exhibition. The last one was at the University of Macao in November last year, being a photographic project that was born from an exchange trip from the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies of the University of Macao to Angola and Mozambique.
In addition to participating in the visit as a teacher, Miguel Quental photographed the daily lives of the populations of these countries. "As I like to do photography I was taking some images during these trips. This is a center that is dedicated to the comparative study of law and the publications that are made in Portuguese in its relationship with China, and I thought it was interesting to make known the culture and way of living from Angola and Mozambique to college students who never had access to this reality," he explained to HM at the time.</description><pubDate>2025-06-09 03:52:17</pubDate></item><item><title>G-Dragon concert | CPSP confirms illegal workers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/concerto-g-dragon-cpsp-confirma-trabalhadores-ilegais/</link><description>The Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) even confirmed that there were illegal workers in the G-Dragon concert, having worked on product sales posts.
According to statements cited by the newspaper or Mun, it is three natural women from the interior of China who are suspected of facilitating illegal employment, while 68 illegal workers investigated are students from the interior of China who study in Macao. In addition, only one non -resident worker (TNR) is involved.
Police authorities suspect that there are two companies involved, and suspects have recruited workers on social networks as volunteers to sell memories during the concert. All illegal workers told authorities that they were not paid.
TNR, on the other hand, provided services in a different professional category from the one that is associated with their Blue Card. Asked how many illegals received money and how long they rendered service during the concert, CPSP agents said they have no information yet.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 03:05:17</pubDate></item><item><title>Typhoon | First storm of the year with signal 1 this morning</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/tufao-primeira-tempestade-do-ano-com-sinal-1-esta-manha/</link><description>A low pressure area that was yesterday in the center of the Southern Sea of ​​China will intensify on the way to Hainan Island and the West Coast of Guangdong at the end of the week. Meteorological and geophysical services will be a sign 1 of tropical storm, the first of the year, this morning
 
Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) will be the first sign 1 of the 2025 Tropical Storm. In a statement published yesterday, when the storm was 810 kilometers from Macao, the SMG indicated that a “low pressure area located in the central seasion of southern China intensified to a tropical depression”, moving slowly “to regions between the island of the island of Hainan and the West Zone of Guangdong ”.
Given that the forecast points to the tropical depression to continue to develop in the coming days, due to its influence, “it is expected that the wind intensifies in Macao later this week”, and that the territory be beaten by frequent and thunderstormdas.
The SMG guarantee that they will continue to follow the evolution of the first storm of the Tuphal time, and appealed to the population that "paying attention to the latest weather information, adopting preventive measures in time."
Bonanza
Prior to the approach of the storm to the Guangdong coast, the SMG estimates that during this day the weather remains very hot, despite the descent of three degrees of the maximum temperature compared to yesterday to 32 degrees. The sky will be very cloudy interval of periods of little cloudy. The scenario changes tomorrow, with the thunder, thunderstorms and generally cloudy sky.
According to the China Meteorological Agency, tropical depression will go west at a speed of 10 kilometers per hour. Since predictions point to increased intensity, national authorities do not rule out the possibility of depression becoming this year's first typhoon. The point of contact with the earth is expected to take place on Friday.
The agency also added that the formation time of this year's first typhoon was later than usual and that in previous years, by this time, the number of storms would surround an average of 2.7. The Hong Kong Observatory also announced yesterday that it would go today to the tropical storm sign 1 and that tomorrow would evaluate the need to increase the alert sign.
Speaking to the broadcaster RTHK, an official from the Hong Kong Observatory did not risk predicting the impact of the storm on the neighboring region, due to the multitude of factors involved.
"In addition to the distance to Hong Kong, the impact also depends on its strength at the time [where it passes through the region]. The cyclone's wind field structure will also affect the wind force and the amount of rain it will bring," said Sha Chi-Tai.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 02:48:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Works | Drainage network changes circulation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/obras-rede-de-drenagem-altera-circulacao/</link><description>Several roads of the territory will be closed to traffic due to the work of clearing the drainage network, in charge of the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI).

In a succession of notes released yesterday, in a reaction to Monday's announcement, several analysts highlighted the greatest complexity for the transition SJM to a period without satellite casinos, given the expected transient softness to Melco and Galaxy concessionaires.
It is recalled that of the 11 gaming spaces that will end, nine operated on the SJM license, leaving only the Casinos of Ponte 16 and L'Arc Macau. For now, it is not yet known whether the dealership will acquire all the property or just the space spaces, but whatever the decision will require government approval.
In a note released yesterday, JP Morgan Securities indicates that the impact of closing the operations of the satellite casinos operating with Melco and Galaxy will be “insignificant” to dealers, as their results represent minimal percentages in the operations of both groups.
The SJM is in a completely different situation. Although satellite casinos operations only represent about 4 percent of profits before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), “controllable” volume, the realignment of about 440 satellite casinos game tables will add thousands of workers to the company's salary sheets. If SJM does not significantly add its market share thanks to the new game tables, the flow of workers may result in losses for the company, JP Morgan analysts indicate.
On the other hand, the CSSA highlighted the surprise of the end of operations of some satellite casinos that had been presenting profits, such as Kam Pek Paradise Casino.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 02:44:56</pubDate></item><item><title>IAM / Portal | Update eliminates about 20 years of statistics</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/iam-portal-actualizacao-elimina-cerca-de-20-anos-de-estatisticas/</link><description>By eliminating the data, AMI caused access to information as to the one that reveals that in 2023 and 2024 there was a peak of animal slaughter. HM tried to get clarification, but had no answer yet
 
The Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) updated the portal with data on the number of animals slaughtered and took the opportunity to fail to present the statistics of about 20 years. HM tried to get clarification on the reason for eliminating the data, but despite an email sent to four advisers on May 25, until yesterday I had not received any response, nor even confirmation of receiving email.
In the past, before the recent update, those who visited the AMI portal about the number of slaughtered animals could not only realize the number of dogs of dogs and cats per month, but also had access to a history over 20 years.
The older data between 2003 and 2007 were less complete, as they only had the total of animals slaughtered without discrimination if the animals were canine or feline. However, all these data are no longer available, without providing any explanation of the decision to stop making the data available to the population.
In addition, according to the new presentation, it is no longer possible to follow the trends in the slaughtering of animals in the territory. This is due to the fact that they would have started to present the data by quarter instead of presenting per month.
General cleaning
The elimination of data arises at a time when the government argues to be implementing a policy of “capture, sterilization and adoption” of street animals rather than resorting to slaughter. This was a policy requested for several years by animal protection associations as an alternative to the number of slaughter. However, between 2023 and 2024 the number of slaughter grew.
The elimination of the data also makes the peak of feline deaths disappeared from the statistics recorded in the first half of 2023, when only 105 cats were slaughtered in six months.
In terms of canine deaths, the elimination of statistics shows how the year with the highest number of slaughter was 2024, last year, when AMI eliminated a total of 311 dogs. However, this number is less than half of what was happening in 2010, the year with the highest canine mortality according to the statistics erased by the AMI, when 718 occurrences were recorded.
In light of the new official statistics, the number of cat slaughter in 2023 and 2024 was 140 and 119, respectively. In terms of dogs, the numbers show a climb, with 220 slaughter in 2023 and 311 slaughter in 2024. In the first half of the year, there were 32 cat slaughter and 69 dogs.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 02:43:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Neto Valente fears that Portuguese community loses influence</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/neto-valente-teme-que-comunidade-portuguesa-perca-influencia/</link><description>Heard by TDM Radio Macau, Jorge Neto Valente, lawyer and president of the founding of the Portuguese Macao School (FEPM) said it is “time to question how long it will be necessary for the influence of the Portuguese to completely disappear [in Macau]”.
These words were uttered taking into account the growing difficulties in obtaining residence, although, according to the basic law, citizens with Portuguese nationality have the right to residence. Neto Valente spoke to the radio in the context of the June 10 celebrations - Portugal Day, Camões and the Portuguese Communities.
"For Portuguese culture there is no better than having Portuguese. When we are watching the departure of some Portuguese, the disappearance [of them] by emigration or death of Portuguese who are not replaced because the difficulty of bringing Portuguese to Macau has been increasing, it is time to interrogate how long it will be necessary for the influence of the Portuguese to disappear completely," he said.
For the former president of the Macao Lawyers Association, “it is not the Chinese who learn Portuguese and very well, and they are valid, talented people, but they are not the ones who will bring the culture, who will promote Portuguese culture in Macao”, saying that it all depends on the “political decision” to define the future of this scenario.
In this way, Neto Valente asks for a "vision", which draws an "obvious path", because otherwise "Macau is diluting, loses his identity, is no longer Macao." He also said he believed that there will be, on the part of the authorities, "sufficient discernment and vision."
Qualified lack
Also heard by TDM Radio Macau, Maria Amelia António, president of the House of Portugal in Macao, stressed that “since I started to face this new situation that has worried me a lot, and it is more and more concerned” the growing departure of Portuguese and the non -renewal of the community.
"How do you make omelets without eggs?" He asked, stressing how Macau can "be a point of diffusion of the Portuguese language and a pole of difference, as China wants, if you do not have the necessary ingredients for this statement?". And leaves a concrete example of the lack of technicians for the House of Portugal School of Arts and Crafts, felt with the departure of Portuguese.
"There have been a lot of qualified people and we miss the many activities we have done. There are professions that are not academic, and I give an example: I need technicians who know how to move the ceramic ovens," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 02:31:08</pubDate></item><item><title>SMG | New Tropical Storm in three days</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/09/smg-nova-tempestade-tropical-daqui-a-tres-dias/</link><description>Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) announced yesterday the occurrence, within three days, of a tropical storm that is expected to pass the island of Haião and West Zone of Guangdong Province, originating in a system of low pressures in the Southern Sea of ​​China.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

Matlombe explained that he will sign the contracts today, one involving “direct financing” and another a public-private partnership (PPP), with the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) state group.
CRBC will build a road with almost 78 kilometers to improve access to Inhambane province in southern Mozambique, which the minister described as “an important tourist zone”. Matlombe has assumed that the cost of the project "will even be assumed by the state itself", since "there is no demand that justifies a PPP or a direct direct investment."
On the contrary, the leader argued that, according to a study already conducted, ”the road to Porto da Beira,“ from the point of view of the business model, allows any investor to recover his investment ”. The minister stressed that Porto da Beira“ is one of the largest in the south of the country ”and that the new access will be“ an alternative corridor ”that will facilitate, for example,“ the departure of Porto ”for the vicin.
Encounters in Macau
The minister spoke on the sidelines of a session of the 16th International Forum and Exhibition on Investment Investment and Construction (IIICF), which is taking place until Thursday in Macao. Matlombe has revealed that he already has at least five meetings in Macao with members of the government of Botsuana, Angola, Cape Verde and Democratic Republic of Congo (RDCongo).
On the table will be the logistics corridor in the North Zone, which connects Maláui, Zambia and RDCongo, to “capitalize the use of the port of Nacala”, said the leader. Matlombe revealed that the Minister of Public Works, Housing and Mozambican Water Resources, Fernando Rafael, also traveled to the region.
The head of the protection of transport and logistics said that during the stay in Macao, the government colleague "will also sign some agreements for the social housing mass for young people."</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 03:04:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Commerce | Prolonged until December anti -dumping inquiry on European pork meat</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/comercio-prolongado-ate-dezembro-inquerito-antidumping-sobre-carne-de-porco-europeia/</link><description>The China Ministry of Commerce announced yesterday that it will last until December the investigation for unfair competition to imports of certain pig meat products from the European Union (EU), which began in June 2024.
In a statement published in its official portal, the ministry justified the extent of the investigation “meeting the complexity of the case”, setting as a new deadline December 16.
The inquiry, launched on June 17, 2024, initially had a one -year duration, with the possibility of extension “in special circumstances”, as it had already been signaled at the time. The investigation focuses on pork and offal, both refrigerated and frozen, as well as fat and derivatives, originating in the EU.
Beijing began this measure as retaliation for customs imposed by Brussels on electric vehicles manufactured in China, claiming that state subsidies received by this sector create competition distortions against European brands. Despite tensions, in recent months there was a slight approximation between China and the EU, namely after the impact of the trade war began by US President Donald Trump.
European Commerce Commissioner Maros Sefcovic, who visited China in March, recently said that Brussels and Beijing "share significant mutual interests in resolving bilateral and global challenges" and stressed that it is "equally important to face differences."
According to the European official, the two parties are “working hard” to achieve advances before the bilateral summit scheduled for July, China, when the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Beijing and Brussels will be celebrated.</description><pubDate>2025-06-11 02:53:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Kenya | Country studies with China investment in the creation of vaccine factories</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/11/quenia-pais-estuda-com-a-china-investimento-na-criacao-de-fabricas-de-vacinas/</link><description>Quenia and China started talks to the creation of vaccine and drug production centers in the African country, a project valued at $ 500 million, Kennian authorities said Monday.

He Qixuan, a student of Shanghai, rejoiced with joy when last Friday answered Lusa's call and said that his visa to study in the United States had been approved. “I'm going to celebrate! It's the first step to studying abroad!” The young candidate for the master's degree in emerging media studies at the University of Boston told Lusa after an interview at the US consulate in Shanghai, where, like her, in the same line, almost 200 candidates waiting for interviews were approved.
If the scene seems to illustrate the commitment made by the US President in the telephone conversation with Chinese counterparts, Xi Jinping last Thursday-and shape Donald Trump's statement that the US “loves to receive Chinese students”-Washington's signs on the subject are more than contradictory, from the perspective of several Chinese sources in statements to Lusa.
The Yi Si agency, headquartered in Guangzhou, specializing in the support of Chinese students who want to study abroad, accounts for the growing concern with the rejection of visas among candidates who resort to their services.
"I have two students from the Macao University of Science and Technology to whom they were denied the visas to study in the United States now three times," the agency director Christ Feng told Lusa, noting that the US consulate "has not provided any reasons" for rejections.
"During Trump's previous presidency, it was the computer students who faced the highest rejection rates, but now the candidates of all specialties risk being refused," Feng added.
Aggressive refusal
Xiangning Wu, an associate professor at the University of Macao's Department of Government and Public Policies, told Lusa that, in recent years, their number of students studying in the United States "has been decreasing due to" increased bribes "and" safety reasons. "
Wu also mentioned that visa refusals have mostly targeted science and engineering students, which has made these students ended Hong Kong and Singapore. Descriptions seem to find resonance in what US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a statement on the eve of the call between Trump and Xi last week.
According to the state department's statement, the United States will begin to "aggressively revoke" the visas granted to Chinese students, and the measure will focus on students with calls to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and those in the United States to study in sensitive areas.
"Under the leadership of President Trump, the State Department will work with the internal security department to aggressively revoke the visas granted to Chinese students, including those with calls to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical areas," Rubio said.
"We will also review the visa grant criteria to increase the scrutiny of all future visa requests from the Popular Republic of China and Hong Kong," added the US Secretary of State.
Homemade
This determination was heard with due attention in China. The Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) in Macau told Lusa that he is preparing to “watch” about 200 students from the Special Chinese administrative region to study in the United States, as well as others who want to continue their studies.
"The DSEDJ has reported with third parties in Macau and asked them to be aware of the latest developments and provide the necessary facilitation and assistance to students in the United States, or who want to study in the United States, with the aim of moving to other countries," the institution said in a statement sent to Lusa.
In the school year 2022/2023, the total number of Chinese students in the United States was 289,526, representing approximately 27.4 percent of the total number of US international students, and heading for the 14th year, according to the Open Doors, funded by the US State Department.

According to the Japanese Defense Ministry, the aircraft carrier Liaoning, two guided missile resetters and a fast refueling ship sailed about 300 kilometers from the easterniest point of Japan, Minamitori Island on Saturday.
According to a statement, after Liaoning and the accompanying ships had left the Japanese ZEE, they performed on Sunday to take off and landing exercises of fighters and helicopters.

In an interview with Hong Kong South China Morning Post, John Lee Ka-Chiu said the indexing of the local dollar to the US currency has been "one of the factors fundamental to the region's success."
Since 1983, even before the UK administration transition to China, that the Hong Kong dollar is linked exclusively to the US currency and can float in a range between 7.75 and 7.85 units per dollar.
Something that also means that the territory's financial regulator, the monetary authority of Hong Kong (HKMA), follows the uphill and fall rates of the reference interest rate imposed by the United States federal reserve.
In May, HKMA had to intervene several times in the market, buying a total of US $ 16.7 billion to weaken local currency. This after the Hong Kong dollar has reached the top limit of the fluctuation range due to the appreciation of Asian currencies and increasing investment in listed actions in the city's stock market.
In addition to foreign investors, continental China investors have bought more local actions, in part thanks to a mechanism, launched in 2014, which connects the Hong Kong and Shanghai scholarships, Chinese 'financial capital'.
In an interview with the third anniversary of his administration, John Lee denied that the financial system depends solely on the US dollar connection.

Still, the indicator, released yesterday by the National Statistics Office (NBS) of the Asian country, suffered a less sharp drop than the predictions of most analysts, who expected a 0.2 percent decrease.
On the other hand, analysts expected prices to keep at the same level as April, but the monthly trend in May was also negative: consumer prices fell 0.2 percent over the fourth month of 2025. The risk of deflation in China, the second largest economy in the world, worsened last year, raised by a deep real estate crisis, which affected investment and consumption.
Deflation consists of a drop in prices over time, as opposed to a climb (inflation). The phenomenon reflects weakness in domestic consumption and investment and is particularly dangerous, as a drop in the price of assets, as a rule of credit, generates an imbalance between the value of loans and bank guarantees.
Dong Lijuan, NBS statistical, preferred to stress that underlying inflation - a measure that eliminates the effect of food and energy prices due to their volatility - rose 0.6 percent, in homologous terms.
"The IPC went from discharge to a drop in monthly comparison, mainly due to the fall in energy prices," explained the expert, who insisted that "policies to increase consumption continue to be effective, as prices in some areas have had positive variations."
China's authorities have repeatedly underlined in recent months that boosting poor internal demand is one of the main economic priorities for 2025, which has been marked by the US trade war.</description><pubDate>2025-06-09 23:58:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Exports go up less than expected under the influence of the trade war</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/09/exportacoes-sobem-menos-do-que-esperado-sob-efeito-da-guerra-comercial/</link><description>China's exports increased less than expected in May, according to official statistics revealed yesterday, reverberating the volume of goods sent to the US in the middle of trade war.
According to Chinese customs, exports increased 4.8 percent in homologous terms last month. The amount was below the predictions of the economists inquired by the Bloomberg Financial News Agency, who expected a growth of 6 percent.
After Geneva in May, Americans and Chinese yesterday began a new round of conversations in London, with the aim of prolonging the commercial truce and reaching a lasting agreement on reducing the custom customs supervised.
Chinese exports to the United States totaled $ 28.8 billion in May, compared to $ 33 billion in April, a record of a drop of 12.7 percent. On the other hand, Chinese exports to Vietname increased slightly in May, reaching $ 17.3 billion.
Uncertain future
“The trade war between China and the United States has led to a sharp drop in exports to the US, but this was offset by an increase in exports to other countries,” writes Zhang Zhiwei, an economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, in a note.
"Commercial perspectives remain very uncertain at this stage" and problems may arise "as the anticipation effect fades," Zhang noted, referring to foreign buyers who had increased Chinese products in anticipation of possible increases in the United States.
In the other trade scale dish, Chinese imports fell 3.4 percent in May, reflecting the weak demand and the growing commercial pressures about the world's second largest economy. The Sino-American talks in London will mark the second formal negotiations between the two countries, since US President Donald Trump launched a global commercial offensive in April.
On the American side, the delegation will include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick, and White House commercial representative Jamieson Greer. As in Geneva, Chinese vice-master-master, he Lifeng, leads the Beijing delegation.
These discussions follow a telephone exchange on Thursday between Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, which the president of the United States described as "very positive."</description><pubDate>2025-06-09 23:56:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Currency | Brazil prepares unprecedented emission of public debt in Yuan in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/09/moeda-brasil-prepara-emissao-inedita-de-divida-publica-em-yuan-na-china/</link><description>The trade war launched by Donald Trump increasingly leads countries to seek alternatives to the US dollar
 
Brazil aims to issue sovereign debt titles in the Chinese market later this year, in an unprecedented operation, when President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva reinforces commercial and investment ties with China.
Brasilia plans to issue titles called Chinese currency, Yuan, in the mainland China capital market, and also wants to return to the market of obligations called euros, yesterday revealed the deputy secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Dario Durigan, quoted by the British newspaper Financial Times.
"The idea is that this year, we will make a new sustainable emission in dollars, such as last year, as well as emissions in Europe and 'Panda obligations' in China," Durigan said in an interview with FT. "The European Union wants to negotiate with Brazil the expansion of bilateral trade, both in terms of transactions and also enabling Brazil the option of issuing debt in Europe," he added. "The same can happen to China," he said.
The Brazilian government has been reinforcing commercial ties with Brussels and consolidating Beijing relations in a context of the trade war launched by US President Donald Trump. The South American Block Mercosur, of which Brazil is part, expects the long-awaited trade agreement with the European Union to be approved by the end of the year.
On Thursday, Lula met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and appealed to Paris's support to the deal. Macron has resisted the ratification of the treaty, the target of strong opposition by French farmers.
Plans to issue sovereign debt titles in China come at a time when the Brazilian government seeks to attract more investment in the Asian country, which is by far the largest commercial partner in Brazil. China is also trying to reinforce its economic influence on Latin America.
Operation will also test the appetite of international investors for Brazilian debt, in a context of growing skepticism in the face of Lula's economic policy, which has bet on the largest state role in the economy to boost growth and reduce inequality. The strategy of increasing expense has generated criticism between entrepreneurs who accuse the government to aggravate inflation, raise interest rates and endanger the sustainability of public debt.
Market game
This week, Brazil placed $ 1.5 billion in obligations to five years with a interest rate of 5.68 percent and $ 1.25 billion due to ten years to 6.73 percent in the second offshore debt issuance by 2025.
Funding costs in Brazil increased after the Central Bank raised the director rate to 14.75 percent in an attempt to contain inflation. Critics accuse Brasilia's executive not to act firmly to resolve the chronic budget deficit and debt growth.
Moody's agency raised Brazil's long -term rating last October to a level of investment degree, which allowed access to the cheapest capital. However, in May, the agency reviewed the positive for stable perspective, quoting slower progress than expected in budget policy.</description><pubDate>2025-06-09 23:55:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the appropriate place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macao, Camões has been poorly used in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Rui Leão, architect and co-author of “Layering the City” | A four -hand city</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/16/rui-leao-arquitecto-e-co-autor-de-layering-the-city-uma-cidade-a-quatro-maos/</link><description>Architects Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni have accumulated many drawings over the years, which have now been materialized in “Layering the City”, a work that was released last week at the Venice Architecture Biennial. The book results from two lives dedicated to architecture and two doctoral theses defended at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
 
How does the initiative come to publish “Layering the City”, which makes the retrospective of your work a little?
This project is born from a dialogue between my dissertation thesis and Carlotta [Carlotta Bruni's] dissertation thesis, who both take different aspects of our contribution as architects to Macau, to the city. And therefore, the project of this book is the encounter of these two theses.
The title of the book refers to the idea of ​​a town in layers.
No, what happens is that in the case of our views, my and Carlotta, there is work brought by each one to the project, and which gives a response to the programmed request, what the client asks, to what lives in the alignment plant [of the project], or a series of questions at civic, public space or the right to quality of life. There are a number of social dimensions [to take into account] to make spaces for people, even when they are impossible [in terms] of politics and in the city. It is these layers that go into the projects and that, deep down, are creating opportunities to qualify the life of the city, the person, the street. And this has nothing to do with those who pay, it has to do with the management that the architect makes in the city through the project. It is these layers, the layers, in which the architect is enriching what is the project's offer to the city and creates several micro-projects within this larger project, which qualify the ride, social spaces and public space in a way that was not requested.
Therefore, in a project of architecture always persists the idea of ​​the people and the spaces they inhabit.
In the case of Macau there is this extreme situation where the public space is always the minimum, with a narrow walk, and where everything is resolved. Because there is a lack of more public space profile in the city, this management done by the architect through the project turns out to be a way to compensate for the city, to reconcile people with it, or the opposite.
The cover of the book refers to Fai Chi Kei's public housing project. I assume that they consider the project one of the great milestones of your studio.
Undoubtedly. This was the first large housing building in collective terms, where we had the opportunity to apply ideas that we had developed to the public space, in Praça do Lago, or even in the park next door. All of these projects have a lot of involvement with the public space and this was our first initiative with a housing program. We did a number of super important experiences that allowed us to demonstrate that it was possible to qualify public housing. We produce a series of gardens, packets, air gardens in various floors [from the building]. We were collecting the floors two to two and four to four to create communities inside the building, almost like a Chinese pharmacy that has drawers, social interaction sites since the bottom floor, and so on. All of this has been worked with small public terraces present throughout the project, and in this respect, it is very innovative. It is, in fact, a demonstration that, whether it is a housing building or a museum, it can indeed contribute to the qualification of people's lives. Any [architecture program, in order to order or contract] it serves for the architect to act on the project.
What other projects are in this book?
We have the Barra station and the intermodal zone [related to the light meter]. There are two projects, for us, very important, because they also come to reconfirm the ability to overlap many and many layers. In the case of Barra Station, there is also a public park on top, and the two marginals, the historic and the new. It is an all -glass, transparent project that allows me to be on the side of the slaughterhouse and see the river and boats through the glass. The building turns out to be a kind of octopus that makes ground level connections, with the gardens around the season that connect with the roof. There is a certain complexity, in which almost a new city system is created and there is at the same time a trial overlap of the train, buses and the passing people. The book also has projects that are not yet built.
What was it like to combine the content of your doctoral thesis with that of Carlotta Bruni?
The book consists of texts by some critics about our work. There is a text by Jorge Figueira, for example, and a great interview conducted by Ana Vaz Milheiro [Academic] and then has our texts.
Is there a presence by architect Manuel Vicente in this work?
Manuel Vicente is very present, because some of these projects were made in partnership with him. Therefore, there is a continuity of these first projects for those who came next, already without Manuel Vicente, and who is very polished for us. Deep down, it has to do with what we not only inherited, but what we brought with us from Manuel.
Presenting this work at the Venice Architecture Biennial, and considering that the MSAR is also represented with an exhibition, is it important for your work and visibility of the studio?
Yes. The idea of ​​publication, with Barcelona's Actar Books, has to do with putting the work, and more than that, its message, which is very specific to Macau and our way of working in the international and architects community, and this goes a lot through the Biennial. It was also in Europe that a consensus was built on the level of descriptions [in architecture] for a few centuries, and where there is a discussion, national and international, around the issues of the profession. We want our work to be present, either through the book and through acting Books, in this international community, to be part of the world.
Leaves and layers
“Layering the City” intends to establish with the international community of architects and passionate about the profession a dialogue showing the last years of work and the vision of the LBA - Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni's architecture and planning. The work is born of the intersection between two doctoral theses of the two architects: “Designing by Increments: Opportunistic Planning as Urban Strategy for Macau” (by Rui Leão) and “Shaping Macau’s Unpurposed Space: Design in Context” (by Carlotta Bruni).
According to a book presentation, "LBA's intellectual contributions are evidenced through the space narratives that integrate complex urban contexts with culturally sensitive design strategies."
The two architects and their team "emphasize the importance of creating spaces that harmonize with their surroundings, while responding to the functional needs of modern urban life." It is therefore a “particularly relevant approach in Macao, where the juxtaposition of the old and the new is a defining characteristic of the city”, it reads.</description><pubDate>2025-05-16 01:04:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Álvaro Barbosa, vice-rector of the University of São José: “Student visa is very limiting”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/alvaro-barbosa-vice-reitor-da-universidade-de-sao-jose-visto-de-estudante-e-muito-limitativo/</link><description>The University of São José continues the negotiation saga with the Chinese authorities to recruit students from the interior of China. Vice-rector Álvaro Barbosa expects, soon, the increase in master's students from 30 to 200. Regarding the internationalization of higher education, the official advocates changes in student visas to facilitate recruitment
 
Does the recruitment of students from the interior of China remain a matter pending to the University of Saint Joseph?
It is a process that is underway. We have had huge support from the Macao government in negotiations to obtain the quota for our university, and they have been tireless in the effort to try to resolve the issues raised by the central government. Many of the questions are legitimate and concern concerns that arise. We were granted a temporary quota of 30 students for masters ago over a probative period, which served to evaluate how we, as Western University, would host students from China. From China, there is this concern with the host of students in Macau. I think we have made a huge effort and the students who are there, included in this contingent, are quite satisfied.
Is this quota for masters just?
Yes. For a degree we do not have authorization yet. In this way, we are currently at the time we try to overcome this probative period in order to obtain a quota of about 200 students for masters. We are in the final phase of the evaluation process and everything has been doing well. We will have the possibility that, next academic year, expand this quota. That would be great, because for our university, to have a greater impact of our mission in Macao, it is essential to have access to students from mainland China. We cannot be a university in an integrated region in a country like China, and not contact with students from China.
Is it more difficult for USJ to compete with other universities, such as those of Hong Kong, by foreign students, outside China?
The issue of recruitment of international students has become a priority for Macao universities. In the last two or three years, it has become evident that this internationalization is very important. What difficulty is there? There is the issue related to student visas, as these visas currently do not allow students to do any kind of work, denying them that minimum local subsistence mechanism to be able to meet expenses. Nor is it contemplated the possibility of, when the student concludes his formation, to be in the territory and find work. What all countries and regions that are competitive in higher education do, such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Australia, is to have incentive policies. Allow students to work part -time, for example. In Hong Kong when a degree ends, the student can stay in the territory up to a maximum of two years to find a job. This kind of measures do not yet exist in Macau, but I think the government is pondering this possibility. From the moment the decision was made that the internationalization of higher education was important, this must be accompanied with the corresponding measures. The current student visa is extremely limiting and does not encourage the coming to Macao to study, only allows coming. This issue was not as present as it is now, but now there is a strategic policy of internationalization.
It is also a matter of survival for local universities.
Yes. Perhaps there is no greater example of a catalyst for the diversification of Macau's economy than higher education. We have ten institutions, 60,000 students in about 700,000 inhabitants. This is the potential of internationalization, to foster diversification.

And also the research that comes out of higher education.
The investigation, the dynamics of the work that is done. There are a number of vectors that higher education brings to a region or country, this happened to Portugal, for example, with the policy of doctoral scholarships for students from abroad, which completely changed the dynamics of higher education. Cape Verde developed thanks to the impact of higher education.
Then we need to make the system more flexible in Macau.
I don't know if it's a matter of having a holistic view of strategy. There may be an idea, but then it does not intervene in all the necessary dimensions to achieve a certain goal. But I am very optimistic. I believe this new student policy is a key step to be taken in Macau. The internationalization strategy followed by all these countries and regions I spoke, and were successful in capturing international students, was always the same. No need to invent much. First, one should increase the capacity and notoriety of universities, and then a policy of scholarships, which will enhance a student flow, creating a reference for the territory, so that studying there becomes a habit. After this flow of students for a few years, an image is already created and some scholarships can be removed, which students will continue to choose a particular territory to study in it. Australia has a huge higher education industry, for example, and I think that in Macau we just have to follow the same strategies. We do, at USJ, that a little.
How, in concrete terms?
We offer many scholarships, and in this sense the Diocese of Macao has helped us build this flow of international students that allow us to create this dynamic that we hope will be sustainable by itself in the future. I think the government is also doing this. There have always been scholarships in Macau, attributed mainly by the Macau Foundation, but this measure will be strengthened. Solving the student's visa issue, creating a scholarship incentive system for five to ten years, Macau will have a bright future as an international higher education destination. But we need to invest, continue, and it takes a few years.
USJ created the “Macau Hub” platform, in partnership with the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in 2023. At what stage is this project?
This project has to do with our interest in developing a relationship dynamic of Lusophone countries centered in Lisbon in the area of ​​entrepreneurship, first. This cabinet we have at CCCM is not intended to offer training in Portugal, but we want to do something else. As we are positioned in the Great Bay and with Hengqin, where it is intended to activate a business ecosystem, we want to take advantage of the fact that we have relations with the Lusophone world to activate the access of the startups of Portugal, Brazil and Angola, above all, to the great bay and hengqin. We are trying to create a kind of incubator of transnational companies, in which we support the development of Lusophone businesses that want to settle in the large bay and also the reverse system. Strategically, for a university, it is absolutely fundamental to have a dynamic in the area of ​​entrepreneurship. Currently, more than half of our students do not want to go to the corporate world, but create their own businesses. Just as universities have to have employability solutions, they also have to have them for entrepreneurs, who are increasingly. So a university has to have a business incubator. My vision of the future for higher education goes around: a university, besides having a library and canteen, will also have its own business incubator. I would say that most students of management or economy courses dream of having their own business, especially in China. China is perhaps one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world. The CCCM welcomes this initiative in Portugal, but we also work with the Portuguese Catholic University.
And concrete results, already have it?
We have a number of small initial projects that are starting now, and we also work with many business organizations. We have now negotiated a series of projects, and I think everything will develop very quickly, based on the manifestations of interest we have. We were in Angola in December and we have already aligned a series of initiatives, we also have projects with Brazil and Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:56:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Adelina Moura, teacher and trainer: “The mobile phone is like a Swiss knife”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/adelina-moura-docente-e-formadora-o-telemovel-e-como-um-canivete-suico/</link><description>Graduated in the area of ​​educational technologies, Adelina Moura will conduct lectures to parents, students and teachers about the use of digital technologies in classrooms, within the “Letters &amp; Company” festival of the Portuguese Institute of the East. The teacher understands that prohibiting mobile phone in schools is not a solution
 
What are the challenges felt by teachers with the introduction of technologies in the classroom? Can the mobile phone actually be a complement to learning?
Yes. I've been saying this since 2005. The mobile phone can be an excellent learning tool, a means to motivate students and to enrich their learning. We have a kind of Swiss knife here, a very powerful equipment in the hands of the students and there is a school failure, because they do not work and help students enhance this equipment they have. What happens is that students learn in the worst way, in a destructed way, by attempt-rrove. There is a gap, as students are not alerted to the positive potential for mobile phone use. They face their mobile phones as a free time use, spending time on social networks and scrolling, and time consumes. It is essential that teachers are users, in their practices, mobile phones, and for the preparation of classes and other projects, to know how to prepare students. I consider that the school has lost several stages of students' preparation and awareness to use these equipment that lead to classes and with which schools have not spent any money. With the prohibition of bringing the mobile phone to the classroom we did not advance anything in this regard.
During the pandemic period, for example, the use of technologies, with distance learning, was quite enhanced.
But during the pandemic we also burned some steps regarding the use of digital by teachers, because before the pandemic many teachers did not believe or used. They thought it was a fashion and they saw no use in the use of mobile phones and other technologies. With the pandemic the use of these equipment proved that without them the situation of education would have been much worse. In these pandemic years, teachers have become more aware of the technologies that already exist and are available to anyone. With internet access on mobile phone, something that has existed since 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone, the e-learning system is enhanced and then we move to “Mobile Learning”, where you can learn anywhere and anytime with mobile devices. It is this reality that we see a little away from school.
And after the pandemic, how has it been?
I think we will take a few more steps towards digital literacy. With Artificial Intelligence (IA), it seems that we are as in the phase I created my first website in 1999 or email in 1995. We are at the beginning. But it is 30 years of technology where there have been many changes, and technology in fact goes on and if we immediately do not realize what we have available, we and students, we help create a moat that has happened in the past compared to digital. In the face of AI, if we do not look back and do not realize what was not done and should have been at school level, we are wasting time. Only a few years from now will people be alert to AI, and the gap is increasing. Hence it is very important to bet now, in this early stage, in the training of teachers, students and families.
Is there much ignorance of parents, removal from this reality?
We have parents who are from this century. That is, they were born with the existence of computers, internet, saw the appearance of the smartphone. But when they studied, the school did not talk about the potential of digital. So these former students came to society and did not bring this sensitivity to digital, to educate their children. We teachers, when we do digital training, are doing good to society because we are also preparing these young people for the future, because they will be parents and should be aware of educating their children. At school we do not only prepare for the job market, but for personal and family life. Hence teacher education is essential. The invitation I received from IPOR seems to me an excellent holistic view of everything, because the school includes several actors, connecting with society.
How should AI be introduced into the classroom?
We currently watch changes in search engines, in fact. We have search engines created from root to Age Age, for example. The best way to introduce AI into the classroom is to ask students and how they use it, and already resort to this tool. At the beginning of the academic year I always ask students to answer a questionnaire about their digital routines, and then I know more or less their practices. In 2023, when the chatgPT came out, I introduced AI in my classes, and realized that students were using this tool to deceive the teachers. Students have to realize that when using AI, they are falling into a certain trap because they are not learning. It is the law of the lowest effort, equal to the phase in which the internet emerged, when students selected, copied and sent to the teacher. We now have the problem that the answers are in Brazilian Portuguese, for example, and see as soon as I was used. We have, therefore, to dismantle this action in the heads and face them. I tell them that they are being intellectually dishonest and that they have not read the AI ​​response, for example. Since 2023, I feel that students, in the answers to this questionnaire I do, say they are afraid to use chatgpt because they are afraid of being caught by teachers. That is, it seems to have gained some conscience.
It will give these lectures in a different educational context in Asia, where the use of mobile phone can be earlier. How will you deal with these differences, or do you understand that the problems of using technology in the classroom are transversal?
It is a transverse question. Do we have to wonder if the use of a particular equipment and tool will make us wiser? It seems to me not, because we may have the equipment, but the use we make it varies a lot. I tell my students that they should be ashamed, because they have much easier access to content than in my time, when we truly had to do research and read in physical format. I tell them that with this technology they should all have a grade 20, and that they are wasting resources, being dishonest intellectually, because they sign works that are not theirs and do not read, even, they deliver. One of the works we have with students is to teach them how to make bibliographic references, refer to the sources. But I am an optimistic by nature, and I hope that in a decade, secondary education students who are fathers and mothers will be able to deal with these problems of social networks and increase fraud with their children. It is this “parents school” that the school can help create. We are in a moment with no return from digital, and forbidding is the most comfortable situation, but it is not the best to face reality. We have to use the right words to alert. We have in this time of alerts and consciences, encouraging the critical spirit of our students, which is little today.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Macao's historicals get a GP clearance</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/historicos-de-macau-conseguem-apuramento-para-gp/</link><description>The Guangdong International Circuit welcomed, last weekend, the second and decisive double journey of Macao - Macau Road Sport Challenge cars, proof of finding for the most important motor racing of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. In a journey with few celebration reasons for the colors of the sinters, the veterans Jerónimo Badaraco and Rui Valente managed to ensure the qualification.
With a list of 68 subscribers, the grill was divided into two groups, A and B, with all the pilots competing with Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8) models. This year, with only one race scheduled for the Grand Prix Program - due to the inclusion of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup - the number of riders was reduced to 36, which placed a supplementary pressure for both missing races. To complicate, the rain came, changing the turns to teams and riders.
In Group A, where Rui Valente faced a complicated weekend on the track around Zhaoqing, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão failed to qualify, in a series dominated by Hong Kong pilots. In Saturday's race, the podium consisted of Wong Chuck Pan, Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping. On Sunday, these three repeated the feat, but with a new order: Lo Pak Yu, Chan Ka Ping and Wong Chuck Pan.
In difficult atmospheric conditions on Saturday, Rui Valente ended only 25th, due to an error in tuning, improving to 15th on Sunday, with the track dry. A penalty after the second race fired him to the 27th place. Still, the 7th place obtained on the first round was enough to secure a place in the Macao Grand Prix.
On the contrary, Maximiano Mannão, behind the wheel of a Toyota with the colors of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended on 26th and 14th, a result below the finding, but it turns out to be positive given that it was Jove Pilot's debut in these wanderings. Célio Alves Dias, with difficulties in his car since the first race, was 24th and 28th, far from the usual level of this experienced Macaense pilot.
Badaraco with final sprint '
On a weekend, where the lively races were broadcast on live streaming in Group B, Hong Kong riders stood out again. On Sunday, Adrian Chung won, with Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin completing the podium. In the second confrontation, Cheang Kin Sang reached a deserved victory, followed again by Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin.
Jerónimo Badaraco came to this challenging weekend without the assured clearance. A modest qualification and 11th Saturday place maintained the open outcome. However, a solid race on Sunday and an excellent 4th place assured veteran Macanese the much desired place on the grid of the Macao Grand Prix, along with countrymen Cheng Kin San, Leong Keng Hei, Lou Check In and Carson Tang.
Also outside the Grand Prix was Dionísio Albino Pereira, who finished 23rd in Saturday's race, but closed the time more forcefully, cutting the line of goal in 13th place in the second race.
At the end of the races, the competitors provisionally calculated had an extra technical verification, being forced to open engines and gearbox, to verify the legality of these two decisive organs of their vehicles.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:57:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Fit F4 World Cup will be in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/09/primeira-taca-do-mundo-de-f4-sera-em-macau/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA), announced on Wednesday afternoon that the 2025 Macao Grand Prix will feature its program with the first edition of the Formula 4 World Cup.
The World Council of Motorsport approved by electronic vote the creation of this Formula 4 World Cup in Macao, along with the return to the Territory of the Regional Formula World Cup, which in 2023 came to occupy the place of Formula 3, and the FIA ​​GT World Cup.
The concept of Formula 4 has been introduced by the FIA ​​for over a decade and has been one of the biggest success stories of motorized training, and there are now 13 different national championships within the technical and sports framework of the FIA. This will be the fourth time the discipline runs in Macao, having been a regular presence from 2020 to 2023, and was even “head of poster” in the three years the world was immersed in the pandemic.
The FIA ​​did not say how the pilots will be chosen, just referring in a statement that there will be "a rigorous selection process of pilots, with only the most talented young people to be authorized to compete." The International Federation also stressed that the Chinese company “Mintimes, organizer of the F4 Chinese Championship, will be the Single Operator, along with FFSA (Fédération Française du Sport Automobile), responsible for providing technical support to the F4 F4 World Cup”. This means that all competitors will have to use Mygale M21-F4 singleolugar, recently renamed Ligier JS F422.
Paris support
The chairman of the FIA ​​monoligae commission, the Italian Emanuele Pirro, said that “Macau is an essential part of the formation of a young pilot, and we have a duty to protect his legacy and future. There is as few challenges as the Macao Grand Prix that we feel that it was the right time to introduce the F4 Fia World Cup. From F4, which is a little more permissive than a regional formula car, so that when they return to a year or two to the FR world cup, they are prepared to truly show what they are capable. ”
Emanuele Pirro, a former guide race vender and a MSAR test enthusiast, also said that "we are also working hard to ensure that we take this opportunity to inspire and educate young Karting riders in the region. The growth and development potential in China and the Asia Pacific region is huge as we boost participating in motorized sport."
Thinking about Macau
The FIA ​​long statement also states that this initiative “also aims to bring students from Karting de Macao, China and the region in general to watch the event in an observational manner, offering them the opportunity to experience a racing test and to obtain valuable knowledge for the next steps in their careers”.
Without going into detail, the international federation, which did not allow it to decline on the participation of Chinese teams in the regional formula cup last year, says that “this big step will undoubtedly benefit local Macao pilots, which will have access to a complete range of international events - Karting, Formula 4 and Regional Formula - on national soil”.
In a statement of Chong Coc Veng, president of the Macao-China General Automobile Association, he said: “We are happy to see FIA ​​hold a F4 World Cup at the Guide Circuit in Macao, which represents an opportunity for young people in the region to find their way of development from international Karting events to F4 and FR singleoligles, and become world champions in the future.”
The participation of MSAR pilots in this race has not yet been officially disclosed, but may be limited in number.</description><pubDate>2025-05-09 00:41:31</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Jaguar that won in Macau in 1984 returned to the tracks</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/06/gp-jaguar-que-venceu-em-macau-em-1984-regressou-as-pistas/</link><description>The more than seventy years of history of the Macau Grand Prix are people, machines and great moments. We were in 1984, when Tom Walkinshaw won Jaguar's only victory in the guide race. After years away from the audience, for the affected man, this same car returned to the tracks at the hands of an enthusiast of the MSAR MOTOR EVENT
 
Richard Meins, an English maritime transport entrepreneur who lived many years in Hong Kong, who participated on several occasions at the Macao Grand Prix, led this Jaguar XJs of Group A in the Historic Touring Car Challenge race, a competition for classics during the Donington Historic Festival. This “Big Cat”, Chassis No. 5 and one of the four original XJs still existing, is practically as it was in 1984, but given the limitations of tobacco advertising, today boasts the colors used in the European Tourism Championship, instead of the iconic black and gold decoration of John Player Special (JPS) that marked the ticket through the guide circuit.
Interestingly, this return to the clues, from a car that has been still in New Zealand and Japan, was scheduled for the Algarve International Race Track, but the Historic Touring Car Challenge canceled its race in early April in Portimão. So it was in lands of his majesty that Richard Meins made his first race with the British car.
“The car won in Macao in 1984, so I'm a big fan of this model,” Ricard Meins told the English magazine Motorsport News. “I still have the photographs I took this weekend in Macao,” said this avid classic competition car collector who, besides driving, supported several riders at the Macao Grand Prix.
In Donington Park, Richard Meins shared the imposing Jaguar XJS, equipped with a 5.3 -liter V12 engine with Jack Tetley, and ended in sixth place, winning in his class. Richard Meins had only guided the car once or twice, but plans to participate in more historic touring car challenge rounds with the 1984 XJS. "Let's try to put it on track more often now," Ricard Meins said, who revealed that he was a stake in the Silverstone Festival in August with this very rare and striking copy of the 1980s tourism cars history.
Premiere of an iconic decoration
In the summer of 1984, Tom Walkinshaw accepted the challenge of the Portuguese organization of the Grand Prix to travel later this year to Macau. With the European title in his pocket, the English driver and team boss was accompanied by one of his usual riders, German Hans Heyer. The guide race was a BMW fiefdom and the controversial English wanted to put an end to the Bavarian domain in the race. To this end, it had the precious support of JPS, which was relaunching the brand, decorating its cars with the famous black and gold colors that would later be eternalized in Ayrton Senna's Lotus. At the time, the guide race took place three weeks before 1000 km from Bathurst, another important race on the worldwide calendar of tourist racing, and so TWR made a "two in one."
The 100 -mile race on the streets of Macau would not have much history, such as the cars built in the Kidlington workshops against the competition headed by the two BMW 635i Schnitzer officers, guided by Hans Stuck and Dieter Quester, and painted by rival Marlboro. Tom Walkinshaw ended first and Hans Heyer and m second.
At the end of the race, quoted by the Portuguese newspaper Autosport, Tom Walkinshaw said: “The circuit is fantastic. Tight, but with many curves, climbs and descents, which made the race become difficult. But I like difficult things and, for me, the race was great from beginning to end.
The Jaguar were again invited by the Macao Grand Prix committee to run in 1985, but Tom Walkinshaw had other plans for his cars. Fortunately, thanks to Richard Meins we will continue to see this beautiful car on the tracks.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Project for new track in Zhuhai emerges</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/automobilismo-surge-projecto-para-nova-pista-em-zhuhai/</link><description>With a very black cloud to turn to the future of the Zhuhai International Circuit, there is a potential good news for the great bay of motoring: a project for a new permanent circuit in the Chinese city adjacent to the MSAR.
According to Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper, Guangdong's provincial government recently published the document “Measures to promote high quality tourism and accelerate the construction of a strong tourist province”, which proposes, for the first time, the creation of an “industrial circle of culture and tourism of the Great Bay”, offering political support to the integrated development of culture and tourism in the region. With this, the first industrial and tourist complex of motorized sports in the Great Bay may emerge.
The project of the Zhuhai Chaoyue international circuit was recently presented at the Zhuhai Ocean Spring Resort, located in Doumen, not far from the city's airport, with an initial investment of 250 million Renminbis.
According to the first information, the project of this circuit provides for welcoming evidence such as Formula 3 and foster collaborative development between motorized sports sectors, cultural events and exhibition industry. The plan includes the holding of several international tests per year and foresees collaboration with Hong Kong and Macau to connect cities such as Jiangmen and Zhongshan, promoting “Multiple stops” and boosting the innovative development of “Event Economics + Cultural Tourism”.
According to Zhou Jian, China Travel Service (Zhuhai) Executive Director General Ocean Spring Resort Co., the FIA ​​grade certification-will also include a karting track, drift track and an interior space of 2,400 m² for exhibitions and events related to the automobile sector. With more than 50 international events projected annually, the goal is to become a "super IP" that joins running, leisure and tourism under the same concept.
The first phase of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit project will include international certification professionals, as well as support facilities. This project aims not only to fill “a gap in the high -end motorized sports sector in Zhuhai, but will also promote the modernization of the Great Bay's cultural, sports and tourist industries by conducting international racing and themed cultural events linked to motorsport.”
Uncertainties in the air
Last summer, the company Malay LBS Bina Group BHD announced that it sold its participation in the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) - the first permanent circuit built in the interior of China - by 124.7 million ringits (about 214.15 million patacas). In a statement to Bursa Malaysia Securities BHD, the group reported that their subsidiary, Dragon Hill Corporation Ltd, sold all his participation in Lamdeal Investments Ltd (Lil) to Huafa Urban Operation (HK) Ltd, a well -known real estate operator. Lil Detinha 60 percent of Zhuhai International Circuit Limited (ZICL), circuit operator.
Raised in 1996 in order to receive the first major award from China from Formula 1 - something that never materialized - ZIC was still the initial motor of motoring in the country and a reference in Asian motorsport. Since its opening, it has welcomed several international evidence, such as the FIA ​​GT, A1 GP or the Intercontinental Le Mans Series. In recent years, track administration has chosen to organize its own events, abdicating the most costly international evidence.
Despite having received, in the past, auto competitions from MSAR, ZIC has been losing protagonism in local motorized sport, due to high prices, limited availability and reducing sports activity in favor of the most profitable commercial activities. The future of the circuit remains uncertain: it is only known that lease agreements between resident teams and the circuit have been frozen and are not being renewed. The track approval will also be about to expire, requiring a new certification to continue to receive competitions in the future.
However, on the weekend of June 14 and 15, the still only circuit of Zhuhai will host the third race of the Formula 4 China Championship season.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 01:53:33</pubDate></item><item><title>ESPORTS | First Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup Decided in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/06/esports-primeira-taca-fia-girls-on-track-esports-decidida-em-macau/</link><description>Next June, for the first time in its history, Macau will host the Extraordinary General Meetings and the Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). This event, which will take place at Galaxy International Convention Center, from 10 to 13 June, will be complemented with extra activity: the first edition of the “Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup”
 
The worldwide body that governs motorized sport has announced this new competition of Sim Racing, which is being organized in partnership with the Advanced Simracing Simeling Simulation Cockpit manufacturer and the popular SIM Racing Iracing game, will be directed to 16 or older female elements, regardless of pre -esports experience. To apply, participants must register on the FIA ​​official website. In addition, it is necessary to have an active account in Iracing to compete.
Online qualifications for the competition, whose finals will be held at MSAR, have already started officially. The first phase consists of participants trying to record the fastest return on Iracing's Attack team. This online qualification phase ends on May 6th. After this first stage, the top 10 classifieds will be invited to participate in the Grande Final, which will take place at the Week of Extraordinary General Meetings and the 2025 FIA Conference, scheduled from June 10 to 13. In Macao, participants will compete in a several day -to -day face -to -face final, where the first champion of the “Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup” will be crowned.
"We know that eSports are the future, but for this discipline to grow and truly develop, we need to encourage more girls and women to get involved," said Ciscal Niroshan Pereira, the current chairman of the FIA ​​eSports committee. “We hope this competition will serve as a catalyst, encouraging aspiring pilot to experience our discipline and consider a career in motorized sport.”
According to FIA, the 10 finalists will also have access to a training program on how to deal with social communication and networking opportunities, gaining a valuable view of the motor sport industry.
Grow on all fronts
This is the first time the fia girls on track initiative has been involved in a eSports competition. His best known project was probably the Fia Girls On Track-Rising Stars program, an initiative aimed at promoting car sports with the female audience aged 13 and 18, and supported young women's pilots between 2020 and 2023. It is recalled that only 1.5 percent of the total sports licenses are women.
Burcu çetinkaya, the president of the FIA ​​Women in Motorsport committee, said that “FIA is committed to double participating in motorized sports and creating more opportunities for women and girls. Electronic sports allow us to reach more vast and younger audiences-especially those with discovering or with limited access to traditional motorized sports. The winner - at the event in Macau. ”
FIA's decision to launch a eSports competition exclusively for women also reinforces the body's bet on the digital landscape. Electronic sports are an increasingly important part of the FIA ​​base development program.
Last year, the Federation added an Appendix of ESPORTS (Appendix E) to the International Sports Code, allowing national sports authorities to regulate and manage national and international competitions. The FIA ​​also supported numerous regional eSports events, received a record number of 117 eSports participants in the Motorsport Games and further encouraged adhesion by offering 12 -month subscriptions from IRACING to member clubs.</description><pubDate>2025-05-06 00:31:27</pubDate></item><item><title>GPM | Carlos Lemos presents volume II of his book in October</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/02/gpm-carlos-lemos-apresenta-volume-ii-do-seu-livro-em-outubro/</link><description>After the success of Volume I, Macaense Carlos Lemos, residing in Toronto since 1974, is prepared to launch, in October, the Macao Grand Prix-Victor H.'s personal collection, 1954-1978, volume II (1967-1978), the second part of a book that intends to honor his father, Victor Hugo Lemos-an enthusiast of the great prize of Macao that Life, collected a vast number of photographs and everything that was related to the car races in Macau since 1954, the date of the first edition of the event.
About the second part of the work, Carlos Lemos explained to HM that it will be “very similar to volume I, but contains more newspaper clippings in English and Chinese of each year, as well as some financial reports of the Grand Prix.

Docued with photographs of the time and newspaper articles, there are some of the most emblematic periods of the mashed event, such as the evolution of the guide circuit, the first victim (Arsenio Laurel, 1967), the birth of the Grand Motor Motor Prize and the Guide Race, the arrival of the first factory teams and the first sponsors, the first television broadcast in direct, and the attempted Hong Kong to create his own great prize itself. Also in addition to a new chapter, with "ten pages of another collection of my father, called Motor Racing World, with some copies of 1900, autographed photographs of pilots, leaders and personalities of world motorsport."
After releasing volume I in 2023, the presentation of Volume II is scheduled for October 15 in Macao and on October 17 in the neighboring Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong.
More and bigger
The truth is that sales of the first volume exceeded expectations. "It was really a success," the author acknowledges, because "there are only two dozen copies left, which I kept for myself, for offers and reservations, if someone outside Macau is interested." However, for Carlos Lemos, “the biggest success was to be able to raise more than 41,000 patacas for charity”, intended for the Macau IC2 [I Can Too] institution, which supports people with autism or disability.
For this second volume, with more recent content, the number of copies produced will increase slightly. "The impression of volume I was 500 copies, and I found it a little" tight "to get a satisfactory number to offer friends and certain personalities and entities linked to the Grand Prix. So I had 550 copies this time."
Carlos Lemos also underlines that "Apomac and the Lusitano Club of Hong Kong promised to support the launch of Volume II, which is very important." The book will have more pages - about one hundred more - and the author confirms: “I've received several reservations!”
Mission (almost) fulfilled
With the publication of the second volume, Carlos Lemos's first major goal will be fulfilled, because "my mission to honor my father is complete with regard to the Macao Grand Prix collection, though not entirely, because my father's biggest dream was to have his name in Guinness World Records."
This is also a curious story, as Victor H. Lemos has applied three times to Guinness World Records, to no avail. "God willing and all goes well, I will try once again, on his behalf, to present a new candidacy for the Guinness Book of Records and perhaps also to Fiva Hall of Fame." Fiva (International Federation of Old Vehicles) is a non -profit world organization dedicated to the protection, preservation and promotion of historical automobile heritage.
“This time, for Guinness World Records, I will submit the application with support documents, such as videos and photographs of the collection and books,” explains the former president of the Macao House in Toronto. "My father wrote only one letter without attaching any document, because in those days there was no ease we have today."
In addition to motoring, Carlos Lemos also reveals that he would like to “publish a book on the collection of matches of matches made in Macao. My father collected labels of matchboxes from around the world - has Portugal, Spain, several countries in Europe, etc. This project depends on the time available and the interest of people”. And we stay here for collections? Maybe not: "I have hundreds too, maybe thousands of old coins - so many that is complicated ... So I won't move (laughs)."</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 06:30:08</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
