“We had two of the United States' staunchest historical allies, two members of NATO […] effectively, in a way, bowing down to Beijing”, commented the analyst in his daily bulletin Sinocism.
Last week's visit by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the People's Republic of China – the first by a British head of government since 2018 – comes at a time when other Western leaders, such as those from France, Finland and Canada, are also seeking to strengthen ties with Beijing, in a trend towards diversifying alliances in the face of the unpredictability of North American foreign policy.
Although Beijing did not announce any major concessions to the British delegation, Starmer returned to the United Kingdom with a reduction in tariffs on British whiskey from 10 percent to 5 percent and with the promise of new commercial partnerships. A business delegation of around 50 companies, including AstraZeneca, accompanied the head of Government, and an investment of 15 billion dollars in China until 2030 was announced.
The visit was preceded by the approval, by the British authorities, of a project for a new Chinese embassy in London, blocked for several years, as well as the abandonment of a judicial process for espionage involving Chinese citizens.
For Bishop, Beijing's strategy does not aim to replace the United States as these countries' main ally, but rather to “explore the space left by fissures” in traditional relations with Washington. Starmer's visit, like that of the Canadian Prime Minister, is interpreted as a sign of openness to more pragmatic relations with two members of NATO and the “Five Eyes” information alliance.
“China continues to have a huge advantage in critical supply chains, such as rare earths,” recalled Bishop, referring to Chinese control over minerals essential to the industry.
A recent report by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) think tank pointed in a similar direction. The document concluded that Donald Trump's unilateral and transactional foreign policy is causing a global realignment, with several countries considering China a more predictable and, in some cases, more trustworthy actor than the United States.
Influence Maps
According to ECFR, only 16 percent of Europeans today see the US as a reliable ally. Among respondents in 21 countries, only 10 percent believe that the US will have more influence in the world within 10 years, while 36 percent believe in China. The report also highlighted that many citizens, both in Europe and in the so-called Global South, no longer see the world divided between two rival blocs, but rather as a multipolar space, where it is possible to maintain good relations with both powers.
For Bishop, China's objective is not to turn Western allies against Washington, but rather to take advantage of the divisions that have widened. “It’s not about turning them against the United States, but rather about expanding the space for influence and negotiation,” he stated.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 02:09:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Patriotism | Sam Hou Fai emphasizes priority to national interests</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/patriotismo-sam-hou-fai-salienta-prioridade-a-interesses-nacionais/</link><description>“We always put the safeguarding of sovereignty, security and national development interests first, resolutely implementing the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’”, stated the Chief Executive in a speech given yesterday at the reception of the Spring party hosted by the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao SAR.
Sam Hou Fai summarized last year's political action, with particular emphasis on national integration and defense of state security. "Within the scope of safeguarding national security, we took decisive measures, handling cases in accordance with the law, in order to resolutely prevent and prevent infiltration and interference by external forces. This ensured the effective maintenance of stability and harmony in Macau", said the local politician.
The leader of the Executive mentioned Xi Jinping's instructions several times, namely the phrase, which has “always present”, “Prosperity should not induce complacency, nor does security justify forgetting danger”.
Stating that 2026 is a crucial year for alignment with national strategies, Sam Hou Fai reinforced the promise to maintain stability. “We will continue to implement the principle of ‘one country, two systems’ in a comprehensive, precise and resolute manner, firmly safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests and resolutely upholding the insurmountable line that ‘there can be no chaos in Macau’.”</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:43:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | Fewer illegal loans in 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/jogo-menos-emprestimos-ilegais-em-2025/</link><description>Last year, the Judiciary Police initiated a total of 192 investigations related to illegal gambling loans, which represented a drop of 23.8 percent compared to 2024. The numbers were released yesterday during a symposium on last year's statistics.
Despite there being fewer loans, the number of gambling-related investigations opened increased by 62.6 percent, to a total of 2,314. This increase was justified with the crime of illegally exchanging money for gambling. This was a practice that local authorities always understood was not necessary to criminalize. However, in 2024, after criticism from the Interior in which the practice of these money exchanges in Macau was identified as a vulnerability for the country's security, the Macao SAR Government ended up moving forward with criminalization.
In the statements made, Sit Chong Meng, director of the PJ, stated that since the law combating illegal exchanges of money for gambling came into force until December 2025, 567 cases were concluded, which led to the arrest of 867 people. Police seized more than 94 million Hong Kong dollars, with some operations conducted in cooperation with Homeland authorities.
According to the newspaper Ou Mun, the increase in crime also resulted from “statistical improvements”, which were not specified.
Sit also warned that “as law enforcement initiatives intensify, the activities of money exchange gangs have become increasingly secretive and criminal patterns more sophisticated.” However, the person responsible promised that the PJ “will closely and persistently monitor” the criminal networks that use legitimate businesses to hide these illegal exchanges.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:55:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese New Year | Votive papers session at Fundação Rui Cunha</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/ano-novo-chines-sessao-de-papeis-votivos-na-fundacao-rui-cunha/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) today hosts the second session of the “Fai Chun – Votive Paper Offering” initiative, in celebration of the Chinese New Year. Therefore, those interested and curious can stop by the gallery to receive the votive papers, which are messages of good luck in Chinese calligraphy, between 10am and 4pm. The papers are free, being an event co-organized by the Poetry Association of Friends of Jardim da Flora.
The FRC welcomes 41 calligraphy masters and poets who will create happy phrases and verse couplets alluding to the celebrations of the New Lunar Year of the Horse.
Fai Chun is a traditional decoration used during Chinese New Year, which marks the arrival of the spring season. In Portuguese it can be translated as Onda de Primavera. People place Fai Chun on doors to create a happy and festive atmosphere, as the calligraphed phrases mean good luck and prosperity.
Normally, traditional Fai Chun are red in color, with black or gold characters inscribed with a brush, which aim to protect the houses with good wishes for the year ahead. Nowadays, printed versions are more common and produced on a large scale. They can be square or rectangular and hung vertically or horizontally, usually in pairs. They not only exist in China, but also in Korea, Japan and Vietnam.
2026 is the Year of the Fire Horse, which begins on February 17, 2026 (the first day of the Chinese New Year) and lasts until February 5, 2027. The Horse is the seventh of the 12 signs of the Chinese zodiac.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 02:06:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Emperor | Sold gold from the ground for 100 million</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/emperor-vendido-ouro-do-chao-por-100-milhoes/</link><description>The Emperor group, responsible for the hotel with the same name in Macau, agreed to sell several gold bars that were placed on the hotel floor. The announcement was made yesterday to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and the sale of the metal was agreed for 99.7 million Hong Kong dollars, which should represent a net profit of 90.2 million.
Regarding the reasons for selling the gold, the group explains that it is part of a new strategy for operating the hotel, given the end of the operation of the gaming space, which in the past made the Emperor Hotel a satellite casino.
“Following the closure of its gaming operations, the Group has been actively planning other entertainment and amusement facilities to enhance its overall hospitality experience and broaden its revenue base,” it was noted. “The precious metals that were originally part of the hotel’s interior design and equipment are no longer relevant to the hotel’s theme in the future,” it was added.
The company's Board of Directors also explained that the sale is taking place at a time when the value of gold has reached historic figures.
The buyer is the company Heraeus Metals Hong Kong, representing the German group Heraeus, founded in 1660, which is dedicated to activities such as trading precious metals, recycling, healthcare, electronic products and semiconductors.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:53:03</pubDate></item><item><title>MGM China | Profits rose 10.7 percent</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/mgm-china-lucros-aumentaram-107-por-cento/</link><description>The lion dealership announced annual revenue growth that promises an auspicious entry into the Year of the Horse. In 2025, MGM China announced record profits of $1.2 billion
Macau gaming operator MGM China announced record profits of US$1.2 billion in 2025, an annual increase of 10.7 percent.
This is the third consecutive year with a new maximum, after, in 2023, MGM China registered a historic record of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization (EBITDA) of around 921 million dollars and, in 2024, approximately 1.13 million dollars.
These data, according to a statement sent to the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, were published “inadvertently”, as the publication date was scheduled for February 11th. The results, the company wrote, will be released today “after the market closes”
Also according to the document, in the last quarter of last year, MGM China achieved profits of US$332.3 million, an increase of 30.5 percent compared to the same period last year (US$254.7 million). The company ended the year with an annual increase of 10.9 percent in revenue, with earnings of US$4.5 billion in 2025 compared to US$4.02 billion obtained in the previous year.
In quarterly terms, MGM China achieved net revenues of US$1.24 billion in the last three months of the year, which represents an increase of 21.4 percent compared to the same period in 2024 (US$1.02 billion).
Above expected
In reaction to the announced results, cited by the GGR Asia portal, the financial services company Jefferies considered that they were between 3 percent and 5 percent above expectations.
However, yesterday was marked by a suspension of trading in MGM China shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The suspension took place in the morning, after the parent company, MGM Resorts, had “inadvertently” announced the results of MGM China, even before it was communicated to the Hong Kong Bola authorities.
Six gaming concessionaires, MGM, Galaxy, Venetian, Melco, Wynn and SJM, operate in Macau, the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Casinos in the region closed 2024 with revenue of 226.8 billion patacas, 23.9 percent more than in 2023 (183.1 billion patacas).
Macau casino revenues reached 247.4 billion patacas last year, an increase of 9.1 percent compared to the previous year.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:51:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Hengqin New District | Less than 40% of homes sold</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/novo-bairro-hengqin-menos-de-40-das-casas-vendidas/</link><description>Until last January, 1,610 apartments had been sold to residents in the New Neighborhood of Macau in Hengqin, according to data revealed to HM. Between the end of 2024 and last month, 222 units were sold, less than the apartments sold in Macau in November alone
The sale of apartments in the New District of Macau in Hengqin continues to follow a pace well below the local market, even with the crisis that the real estate sector is going through. According to data revealed by Macau Urban Renewal to HM, by January 2026, 1,610 apartments had been sold in the New Neighborhood of Macau to Macao SAR residents, which represents a proportion of 39.5 percent of the total available units.
At the end of May last year, Macau Urban Renovation's annual report revealed that 1,388 apartments had been purchased in the Ilha da Montanha housing complex since they went on sale in November 2023, which represented only 34 percent of the total volume of units (4,070).
All in all, between the end of 2024 and last month, 222 units were sold in the New Macau District in Hengqin, a volume lower than the sales recorded in Macau only last November, when data from the Financial Services Department revealed 238 units sold, despite the crisis affecting the real estate sector in the Macao SAR.
House of talents
The anemic sales record in the housing complex for Macau residents in the Hengqin Deep Cooperation Zone takes on a more serious tone given the lifting of restrictions that the Hengqin authorities have introduced since 2024.
This week, it was announced that Macau residents can purchase two units in the housing complex. However, Hengqin authorities implemented successive measures to boost sales. The criteria have been adjusted, including the removal of the age limit, allowing minors to own property, the restriction on resale within five years of purchase has been removed, as well as the adjustment of the limit on purchasing residential units.
Furthermore, in September 2025, Macau Urban Renewal announced the start of sales of units in Tower 11 of the housing complex, with prices at special discounts for parking spaces, renovation works and the purchase of household appliances.
The public capital company also indicated to HM that 200 apartments were reserved and leased to “entities that meet the criteria” to house non-resident talent. The lease of these fractions in the New Neighborhood of Macau was established in the land use right transfer contract signed on April 21, 2020 for the project. The accommodation for these qualified staff was reserved in towers 17 and 18 of the housing complex.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:49:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Presidential | Portuguese choose President over the weekend</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/presidenciais-portugueses-escolhem-presidente-no-fim-de-semana/</link><description>Tomorrow and Sunday, Portuguese people residing in Macau will be able to vote in the Consultado-Geral to choose the next President of the Portuguese Republic. The polls will be open on both days, from 8am to 7pm, after three days of early voting in which 78 voters participated, more than triple the number of those in the first round
The Portuguese will once again be called upon to vote in the second round of elections to elect the next President of the Republic, in a vote contested between candidates from the Socialist Party (António José Seguro) and Chega (André Ventura).
In the Macao SAR, Portuguese people will be able to vote on Saturday and Sunday, from 8am to 7pm, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, just like voters who will vote abroad in the various diplomatic missions around the world.
Remember that only national citizens who are registered abroad will be able to vote. To choose the next President of the Republic, voters must present a citizen card, identity card, or document that has an up-to-date photograph and is usually used for identification (passport or driving license).
On the 27th, 28th and 29th of January, the consulate general received voters who voted in advance. This modality of suffrage was open to voters due to "the exercise of public or private functions, representing a national team. In addition, students, researchers, teachers and research fellows at a higher education institution, patients undergoing treatment, or voters accompanying the aforementioned citizens were able to vote in advance.
According to information revealed by the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong to HM, 78 voters voted in advance in the second round, more than triple the number of early votes in the first round, when 25 early votes were counted.
Local vs National
In the first round, the votes counted in Macau gave an advantage to the PSD candidate, Luís Marques Mendes, with 47.19 percent of the votes, followed by the socialist António José Seguro (20.98 percent) and André Ventura with 12.4 percent.
At national level, António José Seguro won the first round with 1,755,563 votes (31.11 percent), followed by André Ventura, with 1,327,021 votes (23.52 percent) and João Cotrim Figueiredo, with 903,057 votes (16 percent). Luís Marques Mendes ended up in fifth place, out of the second round with 637,442 votes (11.3 percent).</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:40:15</pubDate></item><item><title>National Security | Lawyers excluded with no chance of appealing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/seguranca-nacional-advogados-excluidos-sem-hipotese-de-recorrer/</link><description>Processes classified as national security will cover criminal cases, but can also extend to administrative and civil areas. Lawyers will be required to present information about households, such as nationality and foreign political connections
Lawyers who are excluded from trials related to national security by the Macao SAR State Security Defense Commission (CDSE) are prevented from filing an appeal to challenge the decision. The information is contained in the Government's proposal published yesterday on the Legislative Assembly portal and which deprives defendants of the possibility of freely choosing any lawyer registered with the Macau Lawyers Association.
According to the procedures defined in the bill, the State Security Defense Commission will choose the lawyer for the defendants “in judicial proceedings of any nature in which the competent authority has well-founded reasons to believe that there is a need to protect the interests of State security”. According to this formulation, the exclusion of a lawyer may occur in criminal proceedings, such as the one currently underway against former deputy Au Kam San, but also in administrative or even private law proceedings, if it is considered that in some way “there is a need to protect the interests of State security”.
Within the scope of the ongoing process, even before being chosen as representative, the lawyer must go to court and inform the judge of his desire to be appointed as a representative of one of the parties involved. From this moment on, an analysis of the lawyer and his family begins, which may require the obligation to present elements such as the lawyer's own nationality, members of his family and connections with organizations or individuals abroad, among “others”.
This formulation thus opens the door for family members to have to declare their affiliation with political parties outside Macau. However, the required elements are not specified in the proposed law.
If the judge considers that the elements provided by the lawyers initially are not sufficient, he may also require the presentation of “other information that he considers essential for verification”.
The Boss decides
Once the information has been collected, the CDSE decides whether it considers that the lawyer corresponds to the will of the political power for the specific case, issuing an opinion granting or refusing the “special authorization to the judicial representative”.
The criteria that will be adopted by the Chief Executive, the secretaries, advisors to the Central Government, who do not vote, and other members of the Government linked to the police and other entities were not revealed. However, the law eliminates the possibility of judicial appeal or challenge within the commission itself.
The Government's proposal thus adopts the policy of the electoral law for deputies, with the difference that the removal of a lawyer from a specific case does not prevent him from practicing the profession, nor from submitting new requests in the future, without being “frozen” for five years.
Contrary to what happens with judges, the diploma does not exclude the participation of Portuguese lawyers in processes of this nature.
Outside the control of the courts
The law also defines the powers of the CDSE, which will have the power to issue orders to all public entities involved with the objectives of defending the security of the State, ensuring the prosperity and stability of the Macao SAR and guaranteeing the legitimate rights and interests of the residents of the Macao SAR and other people in the SAR.
The diploma also confirms the CDSE's competence to issue binding opinions in relation to the elections for the Chief Executive and the Legislative Assembly.
However, the law brings something new: the principle that the authorities' decisions follow the CDSE's opinions, not accepting challenges or legal action, unless there is a legal norm providing for this appeal.
The Sam Hou Fai Government's proposal also defines that the commission's work “is free from any interference from other entities or individuals in the Macao SAR”, with no public information about the commission or its work being made available.
Within the scope of the principle of secrecy, the commission can also hire the workers it deems necessary, and carry out expenses without the need for disclosure. The accounts will only be analyzed by the Chief Executive, who also presides over the CDSE.
Ongoing process
The Government's proposal for the new CDSE law is justified in the documents sent to the Legislative Assembly with the need to improve the “legal system and reinforce the top structure of the State security defense system”, to “firmly safeguard the sovereignty, security and development interests of the State, build a solid barrier to defend the State's security and maintain the general stability of society”.
The Executive also indicates that the changes aim to “effectively prevent and repress external interference and ensure that the State’s security interests are not harmed”.
The proposed law enters the hemicycle at a time when the investigation into former deputy Au Kam San is expected to be concluded, the only case made public in the Macao SAR related to national security.
Arrested in July last year, the Democrat has been in pre-trial detention ever since. If the law is approved before a possible trial, the process may follow the stipulations of the diploma.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:38:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Diocese of Macau/450 years | New Catholic Center will have a hotel</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/diocese-de-macau-450-anos-novo-centro-catolico-tera-um-hotel/</link><description>The new Catholic Center should open “in the middle of the second quarter” of this year and will have a hotel, prepared to receive “pilgrims and tourists”, says the Diocese of Macau. At a time when the institution celebrates 450 years, the inauguration of the Catholic Center is based on “the vision” of D. Paulo José Tavares, bishop of Macau in the 60s and 70s
After many years of emptiness and construction work on the corner of Avenida da Praia Grande and Rua do Campo, the new Catholic Center is preparing to open its doors later this year and is perhaps the most important event in the celebration of the 450th anniversary of the Diocese of Macau.
HM asked questions to the Diocese of Macau regarding the reopening of the building, which confirmed that the official opening is scheduled “for the second quarter” of this year. This building, with a total of 17 floors, will have features designed for religious purposes, but also a hotel prepared to receive all types of people.
"The Catholic Center will be a nerve center for disseminating and sharing the mission of the Catholic Church. The lower floors will feature a chapel, an auditorium, conference rooms, exhibition areas and spaces for activities." While “the upper floors will function as a hotel, offering welcoming and comfortable accommodation, imbued with a spirit of service”.
In the diocese's written response, it is added that the hotel facilities “were designed to receive both pilgrims and tourists, welcoming Catholics and non-Catholics with hospitality and inclusion”.
It is worth remembering that in December employees began to be recruited for the hotel unit, in partnership with the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL). In a job matching session aimed at residents, held on December 5th, with the “Companhia de Gestão do Centro Católico”, 23 job openings were made available for sales manager, assistant reception manager, chef, head of security, room service supervisor and acquisition supervisor, reads the DSAL note released in November.
The Diocese of Macau did not want to tell HM how much it would cost to rebuild the new Catholic Center, saying only that initial forecasts had slipped due to the pandemic. "The Catholic Center is currently undergoing development and submission and approval by the Government. Following the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, construction costs have increased significantly. We are grateful for the understanding and support of the builders and contractors, which allowed the reconstruction project to be completed successfully. At the same time, we warmly welcome donations from all sectors of society to help sustain and carry forward the Catholic Center's original mission of serving the Macau community."
A bishop still present
Asked about the main goals of the new Catholic Center, the Diocese of Macau describes that the building “aims to continue the spiritual mission of the Catholic Church and incorporate the spirit of Christ”, influenced by the work of Bishop D. Paulo José Tavares, who carried out his mission in Macau in the mid-20th century.
Of particular note is the fact that D. Paulo José Tavares, who died in 1973 and was appointed Bishop of Macau in 1961, was important in maintaining the presence of the Catholic Church in Macau at the time of the “1,2,3” movement. Between November 1966 and February 1967, the Cultural Revolution manifested itself in the territory, bringing together many local students, who intended to change the content of Catholic education. D. Paulo José Tavares fought with these groups of protesters, managing to keep teaching in Catholic schools and the spirit associated with them unchanged.
In this way, and based on “the vision” of this bishop, the diocese intends for the new Catholic Center to “continue to serve as a vital bridge for the Macau community, promoting dialogue, exchange and integration of faith and culture”. It is also the intention to “open the doors [of the Center] to visitors from all over the world, reinforcing not only its role as a spiritual refuge, but also infusing new vitality into the religious and cultural panorama of Macau”.
António Pedro Costa, author of the cleric's biography, entitled “D. Paulo José Tavares – The diplomat bishop”, described, in an interview with HM in 2023, that the bishop “was a breath of fresh air”, and a figure cherished by the Chinese community at the time.
"These attitudes of valuing the Chinese community led to a rapprochement and the establishment of a relationship of trust. Only in this way was he able to take his objectives forward, as he realized that he had to have the population on his side. But this caused him a lot of trouble with the European clergy, who did not agree with D. Paulo José Tavares' stance. It meant that the population saw him as an ally and not a person who comes from outside and imposes his ideas", said the author.
A year of celebrations
It was in 1576, in the fourth year of the Wanli reign, of the Ming Dynasty, that the Diocese was founded in Macau, with January 23rd being the official date of celebration. However, the next few months will also be festive.
In a previously released statement, the Diocese of Macau states that it has had, over the years, “the mission of establishing bridges between East and West, promoting education, charity and pastoral service”, leaving “a deep and lasting mark on the cultural, educational and religious development of Macau”.
The theme of the celebrations is “From Macau to the World: 450 years of Mission and Mercy”. The new Catholic Center will host two thematic exhibitions, entitled “Honoring the Past, Creating the Future” and “Witness to Heritage, Mission in the World”. These exhibitions aim to “reflect the development of the Diocese from historical, personal and cultural perspectives, as well as its future directions”, highlights the same note.
Tomorrow a sacred music concert will take place at the Sé Church with eight choral groups from Macau, Hong Kong and the Province of Guangzhou, with the sounds of the church's new pipe organ being heard.
From 7:30 pm onwards, the Diocesan Choir of Macau, the Cathedral Schola ensemble and other choral groups from Macau will perform, such as Coro Perosi, Dolce Voce and Cantate Chorus, without forgetting other ensembles from Hong Kong and Guangzhou.
The Diocese highlights that the “most symbolic and large-scale initiative of the commemorative year” will be the “great celebration” scheduled for October 31st this year, which consists of a reception and mass.
“Through this solemn celebration, the Diocese will give thanks to God for the graces and mission granted over four and a half centuries, and will pray that He continues to guide the way forward”, the same statement describes.
There will also be initiatives carried out by “various diocesan institutions” in the coming months, namely “cultural shows, school competitions, academic symposiums, social activities, youth meetings, online training resources, parish initiatives and liturgical celebrations”.
“Through transversal and intergenerational participation, the commemorative year seeks to deepen public knowledge about the historical development of the Diocese and its service to the community, promoting the spirit of the diocesan motto ‘Scientia et Virtus’ (Science and Virtue), which inspires a practice of service based on the balance between knowledge and ethical care.”
At a time when it celebrates 450 years of existence, the Diocese says it wants to chart the future, “walking with the residents of Macau in reflecting on the past and continuing its mission of faith, service and culture in this new stage”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:36:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Historic US allies cede influence to China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/economia-aliados-historicos-dos-eua-cedem-influencia-a-china/</link><description>The leaders of the United Kingdom and Canada “bowed to Beijing”, observed analyst Bill Bishop yesterday, in an analysis of recent diplomatic contacts with China, which reflect a distance from the United States.
“We had two of the United States' staunchest historical allies, two members of NATO […] effectively, in a way, bowing down to Beijing”, commented the analyst in his daily bulletin Sinocism.
Last week's visit by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the People's Republic of China – the first by a British head of government since 2018 – comes at a time when other Western leaders, such as those from France, Finland and Canada, are also seeking to strengthen ties with Beijing, in a trend towards diversifying alliances in the face of the unpredictability of North American foreign policy.
Although Beijing did not announce any major concessions to the British delegation, Starmer returned to the United Kingdom with a reduction in tariffs on British whiskey from 10 percent to 5 percent and with the promise of new commercial partnerships. A business delegation of around 50 companies, including AstraZeneca, accompanied the head of Government, and an investment of 15 billion dollars in China until 2030 was announced.
The visit was preceded by the approval, by the British authorities, of a project for a new Chinese embassy in London, blocked for several years, as well as the abandonment of a judicial process for espionage involving Chinese citizens.
For Bishop, Beijing's strategy does not aim to replace the United States as these countries' main ally, but rather to “explore the space left by fissures” in traditional relations with Washington. Starmer's visit, like that of the Canadian Prime Minister, is interpreted as a sign of openness to more pragmatic relations with two members of NATO and the “Five Eyes” information alliance.
“China continues to have a huge advantage in critical supply chains, such as rare earths,” recalled Bishop, referring to Chinese control over minerals essential to the industry.
A recent report by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) think tank pointed in a similar direction. The document concluded that Donald Trump's unilateral and transactional foreign policy is causing a global realignment, with several countries considering China a more predictable and, in some cases, more trustworthy actor than the United States.
Influence Maps
According to ECFR, only 16 percent of Europeans today see the US as a reliable ally. Among respondents in 21 countries, only 10 percent believe that the US will have more influence in the world within 10 years, while 36 percent believe in China. The report also highlighted that many citizens, both in Europe and in the so-called Global South, no longer see the world divided between two rival blocs, but rather as a multipolar space, where it is possible to maintain good relations with both powers.
For Bishop, China's objective is not to turn Western allies against Washington, but rather to take advantage of the divisions that have widened. “It’s not about turning them against the United States, but rather about expanding the space for influence and negotiation,” he stated.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 02:09:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Patriotism | Sam Hou Fai emphasizes priority to national interests</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/patriotismo-sam-hou-fai-salienta-prioridade-a-interesses-nacionais/</link><description>“We always put the safeguarding of sovereignty, security and national development interests first, resolutely implementing the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’”, stated the Chief Executive in a speech given yesterday at the reception of the Spring party hosted by the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao SAR.
Sam Hou Fai summarized last year's political action, with particular emphasis on national integration and defense of state security. "Within the scope of safeguarding national security, we took decisive measures, handling cases in accordance with the law, in order to resolutely prevent and prevent infiltration and interference by external forces. This ensured the effective maintenance of stability and harmony in Macau", said the local politician.
The leader of the Executive mentioned Xi Jinping's instructions several times, namely the phrase, which has “always present”, “Prosperity should not induce complacency, nor does security justify forgetting danger”.
Stating that 2026 is a crucial year for alignment with national strategies, Sam Hou Fai reinforced the promise to maintain stability. “We will continue to implement the principle of ‘one country, two systems’ in a comprehensive, precise and resolute manner, firmly safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests and resolutely upholding the insurmountable line that ‘there can be no chaos in Macau’.”</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:43:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | Fewer illegal loans in 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/jogo-menos-emprestimos-ilegais-em-2025/</link><description>Last year, the Judiciary Police initiated a total of 192 investigations related to illegal gambling loans, which represented a drop of 23.8 percent compared to 2024. The numbers were released yesterday during a symposium on last year's statistics.
Despite there being fewer loans, the number of gambling-related investigations opened increased by 62.6 percent, to a total of 2,314. This increase was justified with the crime of illegally exchanging money for gambling. This was a practice that local authorities always understood was not necessary to criminalize. However, in 2024, after criticism from the Interior in which the practice of these money exchanges in Macau was identified as a vulnerability for the country's security, the Macao SAR Government ended up moving forward with criminalization.
In the statements made, Sit Chong Meng, director of the PJ, stated that since the law combating illegal exchanges of money for gambling came into force until December 2025, 567 cases were concluded, which led to the arrest of 867 people. Police seized more than 94 million Hong Kong dollars, with some operations conducted in cooperation with Homeland authorities.
According to the newspaper Ou Mun, the increase in crime also resulted from “statistical improvements”, which were not specified.
Sit also warned that “as law enforcement initiatives intensify, the activities of money exchange gangs have become increasingly secretive and criminal patterns more sophisticated.” However, the person responsible promised that the PJ “will closely and persistently monitor” the criminal networks that use legitimate businesses to hide these illegal exchanges.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:55:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese New Year | Votive papers session at Fundação Rui Cunha</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/ano-novo-chines-sessao-de-papeis-votivos-na-fundacao-rui-cunha/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) today hosts the second session of the “Fai Chun – Votive Paper Offering” initiative, in celebration of the Chinese New Year. Therefore, those interested and curious can stop by the gallery to receive the votive papers, which are messages of good luck in Chinese calligraphy, between 10am and 4pm. The papers are free, being an event co-organized by the Poetry Association of Friends of Jardim da Flora.
The FRC welcomes 41 calligraphy masters and poets who will create happy phrases and verse couplets alluding to the celebrations of the New Lunar Year of the Horse.
Fai Chun is a traditional decoration used during Chinese New Year, which marks the arrival of the spring season. In Portuguese it can be translated as Onda de Primavera. People place Fai Chun on doors to create a happy and festive atmosphere, as the calligraphed phrases mean good luck and prosperity.
Normally, traditional Fai Chun are red in color, with black or gold characters inscribed with a brush, which aim to protect the houses with good wishes for the year ahead. Nowadays, printed versions are more common and produced on a large scale. They can be square or rectangular and hung vertically or horizontally, usually in pairs. They not only exist in China, but also in Korea, Japan and Vietnam.
2026 is the Year of the Fire Horse, which begins on February 17, 2026 (the first day of the Chinese New Year) and lasts until February 5, 2027. The Horse is the seventh of the 12 signs of the Chinese zodiac.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 02:06:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Boi Warehouse | Three artists present new visions of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/armazem-do-boi-tres-artistas-apresentam-novas-visoes-sobre-macau/</link><description>Armazém do Boi reveals, from the 13th of February, the works of three Chinese artists who carried out artistic residencies in the territory and who, with their art, outlined new visions of the territory they temporarily inhabited. “O Viajante da Montagem”, “Waste: Soup without Water” and “With Who I Am” are the results of this type of fieldwork
Armazém do Boi has long accustomed us to bringing new visions of the territory with the work of local artists, but also from abroad. The new triptych of exhibitions, to be opened on the 13th of February, will once again reveal to the public new readings about this common and shared space that is Macau.
One of the exhibitions is by artist Liao Yu-An, entitled “The Drifter of Assemblage – Red and Blue, Color Fields and Monsters”. This is the result of a month of experiences in Macau, where the artist “gained awareness of the fragmented and complex nature of the city”.
In Armazém do Boi's note about this exhibition, it is described that Liao Yu-An sees Macau as “a place where scales oscillate between the miniature and the monumental”, and where “multiple facets coexist in dense proximity, resembling a richly layered and intensely flavorful stew”.
In this presentation, “the artist absorbs and reflects on these sensory impressions, translating them into different pictorial expressions”. More specifically, what the public will be able to see are three sets of works that examine “the mechanisms of transformation between visual signs, urban color structures and a subjective perceptual experience”.
Here, painting is nothing more than “a practice of perceptual translation and experiential reconstruction”. "Between montage and transformation, painting stops being just a means of representing reality, becoming a continuous action that generates perception. Colors, images and fragmented experiences intertwine to form a fluid trajectory of visualization, guiding the public on a sensorial journey situated between the city, the body and the imagination", the same note describes.
Another work that will be presented from the 13th is “Residues: Soup without Water” [Dregs: Soup without Water], by Biyi Zhu, curated and academic work by Vivien Chan.
In this exhibition, there are meanings that are taken from a kind of imaginary dictionary, in which waste is seen as “the last drop, grain or molecule spread at the bottom of the pan”.
“Residues: Soup without Water” refers to what remains “after all the soup has been eaten”, looking at the “soft and moist consistency” of the waterless remains of a soup traditionally prepared according to the rules of Cantonese cuisine.
Thus, Biyi Zhu asks: “What are the possibilities of what remains?”, clinging, through art, to “the remains of the past”. This is a return to Macau after a ten-year stay in the Netherlands, and in this exhibition, “Zhu uses the processes and materialities of Cantonese soup to explore ways of traveling in time, between places, relationships and lives”.
"After drinking the soup, the residue becomes proof of what was absorbed by the body, by the atmosphere. Taking what would normally be discarded, Zhu transforms the residue into tangible forms, dissolving and reformulating ideas of memory, kinship, migration and waste", it further reads.
Personal issues
The third exhibition space is composed of “Who Am I With”, by Li Aixiao, curated by Wendy Wong. This is an exhibition with a more personal nature, which begins with the artist’s “self”, when he “enters the lives, languages ​​and objects of others”.
To do this, he uses performance, photography and other artistic interactions “to persistently question with whom and how we establish connections in this place”. "The works unfold between the approaching and distancing of the body and between the occurrence and interruption of exchange, where some connections take root while others remain in the realm of the unfulfilled. As viewers navigate and observe, they perceive the transitory transformation of identity and the emergence or absence of intimacy, witnessing how language, images and objects serve as modes of presence", it is described.
In this way, “these works point to a state of coexistence that remains perpetually unstable, but that occasionally awakens rare and authentic connections at the moment of encounter”. The three exhibitions can be seen free of charge until March 15th.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 02:01:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Mineral trade | Beijing rejects fragmentation after US initiative</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/comercio-de-minerais-pequim-rejeita-fragmentacao-apos-iniciativa-dos-eua/</link><description>China yesterday rejected the creation of exclusive “small circles” in international trade in critical minerals and advocated an “open, inclusive and universally beneficial” trading environment, in response to US-led initiatives.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference that “maintaining an open, inclusive and universally beneficial international trade environment serves the common interests of all countries”.
Lin further stressed that “all parties have a responsibility to play a constructive role” to safeguard the stability and security of global production and supply chains for critical minerals.
The spokesperson added that China “opposes any country harming the international economic and commercial order through exclusive ‘small circles’ rules”, in an indirect reference to the cooperation mechanisms promoted by Washington with partners and allies to reduce China's dependence in this sector.
The statements come after the United States announced the creation of a commercial alliance for critical minerals and Washington and the European Union agreed on a first joint action plan to coordinate supply policies for these raw materials, considered essential for industries such as semiconductors, advanced batteries and defense.
Beijing reiterated in recent days that its position on the stability of global supply chains “has not changed” and defended the strengthening of communication and dialogue between countries, to the detriment of formulas that “fragment international trade”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:59:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Airport | CAM aims for 8.14 million passengers in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/aeroporto-cam-aponta-para-814-milhoes-de-passageiros-em-2026/</link><description>After a year of 2025 in which the airport lost passengers and commercial flights, those responsible for CAM – Sociedade do Aeroporto Internacional de Macau believe that 2026 will be different. According to figures presented during a Lunar New Year lunch, organized yesterday, the company estimates it will receive 8.14 million passengers and 63,000 commercial flight arrivals and departures throughout this year.
The numbers indicated by the company, and cited by the newspaper Ou Mun, represent an annual increase of 8.2 percent in the number of passengers and 8.6 percent in the number of arrivals and departures of commercial flights.
The annual estimate for the number of passengers in 2026 is still below what happened before the pandemic. In 2019, the airport received a total of 9.61 million passengers, the highest figure since it began operating, and in the previous year it had received 8.26 million passengers.
The increase in the number of passengers is expected, despite the chairman of the company's Executive Committee, Simon Chan Weng Hong, having revealed that from October this year until October 2029 the airport will be closed between night and 8am. The closure was justified by the expansion of infrastructure and landfill. Regarding these works, Simon Chan stated that a “minimal impact” on the operation of the airport is expected.
The president of the CAM Executive Committee also revealed that new restaurants will open at the airport in April, offering meals prepared by some of the best-known local brands.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 05:52:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>The leaders of the United Kingdom and Canada “bowed to Beijing”, observed analyst Bill Bishop yesterday, in an analysis of recent diplomatic contacts with China, which reflect a distance from the United States.
“We had two of the United States' staunchest historical allies, two members of NATO […] effectively, in a way, bowing down to Beijing”, commented the analyst in his daily bulletin Sinocism.
Last week's visit by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the People's Republic of China – the first by a British head of government since 2018 – comes at a time when other Western leaders, such as those from France, Finland and Canada, are also seeking to strengthen ties with Beijing, in a trend towards diversifying alliances in the face of the unpredictability of North American foreign policy.
Although Beijing did not announce any major concessions to the British delegation, Starmer returned to the United Kingdom with a reduction in tariffs on British whiskey from 10 percent to 5 percent and with the promise of new commercial partnerships. A business delegation of around 50 companies, including AstraZeneca, accompanied the head of Government, and an investment of 15 billion dollars in China until 2030 was announced.
The visit was preceded by the approval, by the British authorities, of a project for a new Chinese embassy in London, blocked for several years, as well as the abandonment of a judicial process for espionage involving Chinese citizens.
For Bishop, Beijing's strategy does not aim to replace the United States as these countries' main ally, but rather to “explore the space left by fissures” in traditional relations with Washington. Starmer's visit, like that of the Canadian Prime Minister, is interpreted as a sign of openness to more pragmatic relations with two members of NATO and the “Five Eyes” information alliance.
“China continues to have a huge advantage in critical supply chains, such as rare earths,” recalled Bishop, referring to Chinese control over minerals essential to the industry.
A recent report by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) think tank pointed in a similar direction. The document concluded that Donald Trump's unilateral and transactional foreign policy is causing a global realignment, with several countries considering China a more predictable and, in some cases, more trustworthy actor than the United States.

Authored by Caspar Chan and Nathan Rubene dos Santos, “Foral of the City of the Name of the God, Macau”, contains translations and annotations of documents that show how the founding of Macau had Évora as a model

A book, divided into two volumes, has just been published by the local association Heritage Society, which helps tell the story of the founding of Macau, from the mid-16th century onwards. The two volumes are entitled “Foral of the City of the Name of the God, Macau: Évora of the Far East” and “The Twenty-eight Alvarás”, and are authored by academics Caspar Chan and Nathan Rubene dos Santos.
The first volume, which establishes a curious connection between Macau and Évora in the founding of the territory to the East, is based on the archive “Foral, Regalias e Privilégios Concedidos à Cidade de Macau, na China, 1596-1756”, the original of which is kept at the National Archives of Rio de Janeiro, and there are microfilms at the Macau Archive.
In turn, the part dedicated to the 28 charters, a continuation of the first volume, analyzes the 28 legal texts initially decreed by the then governor of Macau and viceroy of India, D. Rodrigo da Costa, in 1689. These documents were later confirmed by King D. João V, in Portugal, in 1709.
As the authors told HM, in a joint email interview, the first volume “deals with the first part of the archive, or the first 17 sheets, which concern the oldest founding letters, letters and sentences received by the Senate of Macau during the last years of the 16th century”.
The second volume analyzes the contents of the file between pages 17 and 33, covering the 28 permits. “This is not yet the complete story, as we intend to continue working on the remaining archive in future years”, confessed the authors.
The authors highlight the importance of the charter, an ancient document that consisted of “a charter or contract that the governing power, be it a feudal lord, a bishop or a king, establishes with a local entity, be it a village or city, a senate or a council”.
"We consider that the word and the concept are important to reflect on this historical period and not only in Macau, but also the time when the European kingdom [Portugal] was at the height of its expansion across the seas and oceans. The concept of charter implies the way in which a Portuguese social structure was being transplanted and rethought in Macau."
In this way, the authors add, all documents analyzed for these two volumes are related to the idea of ​​charter.
In turn, the designation “City of the Name of God of Macau” appears, in this specific file, “not only in the charter of King Philip I of Portugal, during the Iberian Union, which stipulates the elevation of Macau from a town to a city, but also throughout the 28 subsequent charters”.
In concrete terms, readers can come across “a research work that addresses some of the most important documents in the history of Macau, documents that inform us about the founding of the city and the evolution of its legal and governing tradition”.
The connection with Évora
The first volume of the work includes the subtitle “Évora of the Far East”, relating “the story in which the town's Senate presented a petition to the Viceroy of India for the recognition of the Senate, for the elevation of this port to the status of city and for the granting to the 'new city' of Macau of the privileges, rights and freedoms of the city of Évora”.
D. Duarte de Meneses, at the time governor of Macau and viceroy of India, ended up granting this request on behalf of King D. Filipe I, in 1586, a “decision that was later confirmed by the king himself in 1595”. “To confirm and corroborate that Macau had the same status as Évora, it became natural that all the founding documents of the city of Évora were transcribed to Macau, so that the Senate of Macau could preserve them as evidence and keep them in its archives as founding documents of the city”, explain the authors.
The documents found in the archive based in Rio de Janeiro point out that “the ‘proof’ of Macau’s status as a city comparable to Évora does not consist of a single document, but a compilation of several texts”.
In the first volume of the work there are examples such as “sentences on the jurisdiction of certain positions, such as the Prosecutor and the Almotacé, royal letters on specific issues, laws on which positions should be part of a Senate, rites of religious and funeral processions and even the configuration of the Senate room”.
In short, “everything that Évora possessed de jure during this period was inherited by Macau, as proven by the meticulous transcription and authentication of these documents”, explain the authors.
The survival permits
Regarding the second volume of the work, focused on the 28 permits, the authors understand that these documents “are particularly significant because they present themselves as a cohesive set, with great integrity in terms of language, format, administration and argumentation”.
For Caspar Chan and Nathan Rubene dos Santos, this results from the fact that, at the end of the 17th century, Macau was no longer in its golden period of trade, “due to the loss of commercial routes”.
"At the same time, Macau faced constant social unrest, both internally – for example, between the Senate, the Captain-General and the Ouvidor – and externally, in relations with the Chinese and Castilians. The privileges and rights of the Senate were not respected, and it was necessary to resolve ambiguities to guarantee the city's survival, as reflected in the various minutes of the Senate meetings."
Thus, a petition was presented by these bodies to governor D. Rodrigo da Costa “for the reaffirmation of the city's rights and to present solutions to various problems, such as the overflow of the jurisdiction of the Captain-General, the preservation of the Padroado in the face of foreign missionary groups and trade with the Chinese and in Solor and Timor”.
Thus, the 28 permits emerged, which “also deal with a very diverse group of people from different arts, professions, origins and ideologies”, and not just relations between Portuguese and Chinese, which made “this set of documents particularly interesting to study”.
The aim of publishing these two volumes was to facilitate access to the archive and its information. “We intend to place in the hands of Macau readers a fundamental document of the legal and political origin of the city, which remains little studied, even in Portuguese-speaking historiography, and which is almost completely absent from the daily historical imagination of Macau”, they add.
The archive based in Rio de Janeiro was translated by the authors “and was never published in full, especially the founding documents related to Évora, not even in Portuguese”.
This archive almost always appears “indirectly, as excerpts and paraphrases, such as those of canonical historians of Macau, in the case of Manuel Teixeira; or as references inserted in specialized works, and in some cases only through digitalized transcriptions that circulate in doctoral theses”.
In the case of permits, they are “better known among historians, but appear only in very limited publications”. "For this reason, the publication of the primary text itself becomes essential. By presenting it in English and Chinese, alongside Portuguese, we also seek to remove a barrier that has long structured Macau's historiography, dividing the city's documentary past into separate linguistic archives that rarely dialogue with each other", they conclude.
Caspar Chan and Nathan Rubene dos Santos also understand that “these volumes offer new answers in historiographical terms, because they show with renewed clarity that the legal existence of Macau emerged through the transplantation and local adaptation of the Portuguese municipality [Évora] as a governing idea on an Asian border”.
“At its core, the archive poses a fundamental question that often remains implicit: what counted as ‘Portuguese territory’ in its smallest civic unit, and how could this unit be reconstructed overseas through privileges, positions and jurisdiction, after Portugal had become global from the 15th century onwards?”
Local management
Regarding the relationship between Portugal and China at the time, the authors state that the work shows how “relations between China and Portugal in Macau were not carried out mainly through formal diplomacy between two distant courts, but through the daily management of coexistence by local institutions, in conditions of unequal jurisdiction”.
The first volume of the book shows how “the king elevated Macau from a town to a city and confirmed the elections of councillors, judges and officials because the Captain-Major appointed to China frequently left for the annual trip to Japan, remaining only a short time there and leaving the settlement without continuous leadership”.
The original document reveals that “this situation was especially dangerous in China, given Macau's distance from India and the fact that supplies could only be made during the annual trip”. In this way, “municipal government is presented as a necessity: a frontier city could not wait for an absent commander nor could it allow disorder.”
Thus, the authors add, “the privileges, jurisdiction and civic positions granted to Macau describe a political logic as much as a legal one, since the Portuguese presence depended on a permanent local body capable of maintaining peace and managing risks in a space where the superior authority was distant”.
Regarding the permits, they show what maintaining the stability of the territory entailed, as “the survival of Macau depended on remaining within the limits tolerated by the Chinese authority”.
"The Twenty-sixth Alvará, for example, is explicit in stating that the Chinese mandarinate did not accept Portuguese jurisdiction over Chinese subjects, especially when Christian creditors sought to arrest Chinese debtors. The Senate describes the expenses and dangers caused when a mandarin was sent to enforce such determinations and requests a direct solution: preventing Christians from contracting credits with the Chinese and denying them recourse to both the Ombudsman and the Chinese courts, so that the city could 'live in peace’. The Crown confirms this approach”, they conclude.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 05:40:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Portugal prepares to choose the next President of the Republic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/eleicoes-portugal-prepara-se-para-escolher-o-proximo-presidente-da-republica/</link><description>Portugal goes to the vote on Sunday to choose the next President of the Republic. Of the 11 candidates, only two have representatives from Macau: Bessa Almeida from the PSD, and Neto Valente from the PS. The former president of the Macau Lawyers Association highlights that António José Seguro “does not join in provocations against China”, while Bessa Almeida considers that Marques Mendes is the right man for the moment


 
Eleven candidates will vote on Sunday to choose the next President of the Portuguese Republic, for a five-year term. This is a record number, with only seven having the support of political parties. Running for the position is Luís Marques Mendes, supported by the Social Democratic Party (PSD), and who appointed António Bessa Almeida as his representative in the Macao SAR. Next comes António José Seguro, with the support of the Socialist Party (PS), which has Jorge Neto Valente, president of the Macau Portuguese School Foundation and lawyer, as his representative. They are the only candidates for the Presidency of the Republic who chose figures as representatives of the Macao SAR.
The remaining candidates are Henrique Gouveia e Melo, João Cotrim de Figueiredo, Catarina Martins, António Filipe, André Ventura Jorge Pinto, Manuel João Vieira, André Pestana and Humberto Correia.
To HM, António Bessa Almeida, PSD activist and explained the reasons for supporting Marques Mendes. “At the time Portugal is going through, the country needs a candidate like Marques Mendes, who has a deep understanding of the different policies”, he began by pointing out.
Asked about the type of actions developed in Macau to attract the electorate to vote for Marques Mendes, Bessa Almeida simply mentioned that “the campaign in Macau is totally different from that in Portugal”, and the actions developed involve “what the candidate does in close proximity to the people, passing on information”.
For Bessa Almeida, “the electorate in Macau, on the Chinese side, is also made up of Portuguese”, and that “they have been following these elections like any other Portuguese, with confident visions for the future of Portugal”.
On January 6th, the president released a note highlighting the importance of Marques Mendes' candidacy, who is currently far from the top spots in the polls. "We have always been concerned with everything related to Portugal and at this moment, at a global level, political changes are sudden and unexpected. That is why we need a visionary president, experienced and thoughtful in guiding the destinies of Portugal and Portuguese people born and living outside the country."
 
A safe return
In Portugal, polls relating to the presidential elections have taken place almost daily, and show a change in the choice of candidates. If initially António José Seguro was somewhat removed from the top positions, a survey carried out by the Universidade Católica Portuguesa for RTP, Antena 1 and the Público newspaper, between the 6th and 9th of January and released this week, shows how Seguro is in a technical tie with André Ventura, Chega's candidate, guaranteeing 23 percent of voting intentions, when Ventura collects 24 percent. João Cotrim de Figueiredo comes in third place, with 19 percent, with the possibility of going to the second round of elections, followed by Marques Mendes and Gouveia e Melo with 14 percent.
Another survey, this time for TVI, CNN, TSF and Jornal de Notícias, with data collected on the 10th, 11th and 12th of January, shows Seguro with 23.9 percent of voting intentions, followed by Cotrim de Figueiredo with 20.8 percent and Ventura with 20.5 percent. Marques Mendes falls to fifth place, with 13.2 percent.
Seguro chose, in the Macao SAR, Jorge Neto Valente as his agent, who did not answer HM's call. In a statement published in the newspapers this Wednesday, the former president of the Macau Lawyers Association declared that Seguro “proposes a vision of the future based on the modernization of the country, the valorization of education and a focus on innovation”. Referring specifically to Portugal-China relations, Neto Valente highlights that “unlike other candidates, Seguro does not support China's provocations regarding the status of Taiwan, and is also a candidate who “knows Portugal, Europe and the world”.
Neto Valente also stated that Seguro “is a decent man”. “He participated in all debates, showed politeness, defended his ideas firmly, was never excessive in his language and, unlike others, did not insult opponents or make malicious insinuations toward them.”
 
A “consistent course”
Paulo Pisco, leader of the Insurance campaign for emigration, reminded HM that the candidate “even expressed the opinion that, given that it was an in-person vote [for the presidential elections], the Government could have done much more, namely complying with what the electoral law for the Presidency of the Republic says, which is the possibility of opening more polling stations”.
Seguro also defended, according to Paulo Pisco, “that mobility voting could also have been applied, based on the experience previously carried out in the last elections for the European Parliament”.
Paulo Pisco states that António José Seguro has followed a “very consistent, solid and objective path”, which has allowed him to reach the top of the polls. Regarding the emigrated electorate, the deputy highlights that Seguro “has not deviated from the purposes, form and values ​​with which he intends to exercise the Presidency of the Republic”.
Furthermore, it is “a guarantor of the stability of the political system and also of democracy”. “This image that the candidate António José Seguro has shown throughout his career has earned him greater receptivity from voters”, highlighted Paulo Pisco.
The president does not forget that “Seguro is the candidate who has the most representatives per country in our diaspora”. "There are 18, ten in Europe and eight outside Europe. I believe that this substantiates a very firm commitment from the candidate to the exercise of his functions as President of the Republic, and to the relationship he intends to have with the diaspora", he stressed.
Looking at the candidates lower down in the polls, we have many faces from the left. The same survey with data collected on the 10th, 11th and 12th of January places Catarina Martins, from Bloco de Esquerda, with 2.5 percent; followed by António Filipe, from PCP, with 1.4 percent, head to head with Jorge Pinto, from Livre, who has 1.3 percent. Manuel João Vieira, visual artist and musician, obtains 1 percent of voting intentions.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Estudo | Sociedade de Hong Kong domina notícias sobre depressão</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/14/estudo-sociedade-de-hong-kong-domina-noticias-sobre-depressao/</link><description>A study published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research analyzed the themes and emotional tone of news stories about depression published in Hong Kong. The “societal system”, related to health, family or work, comes first with 34.83 percent of total news, having a “more negative inclination”
The Hong Kong society system dominates the group of topics present in news about depression, representing 34.83 percent of the articles analyzed, followed by topics such as law enforcement, with 18.81 percent, or the global economic recession in third place.
This is the main conclusion of the study “Analyzing Themes, Feelings, and Coping Strategies Regarding Online News Coverage of Depression in Hong Kong: Mixed Methods Study”, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research last year. The study was authored by Chen Sihui, Cindy Sing and Yangna Hu, from Hong Kong Polytechnic University; and Cecília Cheng, from the University of Hong Kong.
The study is focused on online news coverage about depression in the neighboring region, namely from publications such as the South China Morning Post and Hong Kong Free Press, and sought to understand the dominant themes and the emotional charge of the texts, whether they were positive or negative, among other issues.
Thus, the study reveals that the region's “societal system” was at the origin of 34.83 percent of news about depression, that is, 848 out of a total of 2,435, followed by the theme of “law enforcement”, representing 458 of all news analyzed, with a share of 18.81 percent. This is followed, in third place, by the theme of “global recession”, with 17.4 percent of responses; “lifestyle”, with 8.05 percent; “leisure”, with 11.21 percent of responses; “health issues”, with 6.94 percent and, finally, “United States politics”, representing just 3.12 percent of the news.
The study therefore describes that analyzing the sentiment inherent to the news, “it becomes evident that the societal system presented a more negative inclination”, being “related to several systems of Hong Kong society, including health, social, family, education and work”.
Between extradition and covid-19
The collection of online news was carried out between February 2019 and May 2024 “with the aim of examining the most recent representation of depression, especially during and after the period of social unrest and the covid-19 pandemic”.
The articles were chosen based on three criteria, one of which was accessibility to readers without a paid subscription, in addition to the fact that the website in question “should allow the retrieval of a sufficient quantity of depression-related news (i.e., more than 20) to ensure adequate data for subsequent analyses.” Websites with news in English were also chosen. Then, separate searches were carried out using the keywords “depression” and “depressed”.
The dates chosen for this study relate to two events. One of them was in February 2019, with the introduction of the proposed law on extradition to China, entitled “Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment)”. This “triggered protests and marches in Hong Kong due to political differences, leading to a significant increase in cases of depression, worsened in 2020 with the outbreak of Covid-19”.
The authors reveal that there were “peaks in coverage” of news related to depression, namely in April and May 2020 and in July 2023. Covid-19 followed as a second occurrence.
In the case of news from 2020, the study finds that “confinement measures due to covid-19 strongly affected Hong Kong, contributing to a more depressive mood”, and this period “corresponded to the second wave of the covid-19 outbreak”. The second pandemic wave led to strong confinement measures such as the closure of schools, “remote work policies and the ban on in-person meals in restaurants”.
The closure of schools, “as reported in the news, resulted in increased rates of depression among children and anxiety among parents, who had to simultaneously care for their children and elderly people at home.”
“In addition, conflicts between work and family also intensified due to the interruption of the normal work routine”, namely “the absence of office space and unclear working hours”, which “was associated with depressive feelings”, it is described.
In turn, in 2023 there was an “increase in reported suicide cases”, especially because Coco Lee, “an influential star who faced depression, died by suicide at home, which generated greater awareness about the need to expand support services in the area of ​​mental health and improve accessibility, with helplines frequently being highlighted”.
A certain stigma
With regard to the second most common topic found in the news, “law enforcement”, the study highlights that it also causes “a negative feeling”. “The volume of news reached peaks in November 2020 and August 2019”, and in 2020, “individual crimes and legal proceedings were mainly reported, with emphasis on the case of a Hong Kong teacher who murdered his wife, which may have caused a great social shock and public attention”.
The authors explain that, in this case, “depression was frequently cited in the news as an explanation for the perpetrator's illegal actions, which can reinforce stigmatizing attitudes and portray people with depression as violent, dangerous and more likely to commit crimes”.
Other topics that also showed “negative trends” are “health issues” and “United States politics”, with topics such as “lifestyle” or “leisure” “tending towards more positive feelings”.
With regard to another theme associated with news about depression, that of the “global recession”, the focus is the “economic difficulties caused by the spread of covid-19 in different sectors”, presenting “a more contradictory positive feeling”. In other words, “the structure of the reports initially described the economic challenges, to then emphasize the initiatives to facilitate recovery in response to the crisis”.
Thus, the authors note that “a significant change in general sentiment was observed”, as “until January 2021, the continuous decrease in the amount of positive news was interrupted”, and that afterwards “the aggregate number of positive news exceeded that of negative news almost every month, signaling a general change from a negative feeling to a more positive feeling in relation to the economic circumstances discussed”.
The authors consider that the change may be due “to the fact that people have been forced to adapt to a ‘new normal’ and begin the recovery of the economy, health, and society after a year of living with the pandemic”. Regarding the theme of US politics found in news associated with depression, the texts “emphasized rivalry and the presidential electoral process, as well as politicians from different parties who experienced depression”.
Few institutional responses
The study also looked at so-called coping strategies, that is, cognitive or behavioral efforts used to deal with less good situations. And here, the news analyzed focused mainly on “information about skills and resources” available to help people with depression, such as “support lines for suicidal intentions and suicide prevention”. Mental health programs provided by local organizations were also presented, such as Mind HK, the Kely Support Group and the Mental Health Association of Hong Kong, and articles were written about “counseling services and therapies for people with depression”, or even physical exercise recommendations.
The authors highlight that, when analyzing the news, they noticed “the insufficiency of political interventions, institutional support and financial assistance for individuals with depression, which indicates a deficiency at the societal level of coping strategies and which are present in journalistic coverage”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 02:06:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Diocese of Macau/450 years | New Catholic Center will have a hotel</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/diocese-de-macau-450-anos-novo-centro-catolico-tera-um-hotel/</link><description>The new Catholic Center should open “in the middle of the second quarter” of this year and will have a hotel, prepared to receive “pilgrims and tourists”, says the Diocese of Macau. At a time when the institution celebrates 450 years, the inauguration of the Catholic Center is based on “the vision” of D. Paulo José Tavares, bishop of Macau in the 60s and 70s
After many years of emptiness and construction work on the corner of Avenida da Praia Grande and Rua do Campo, the new Catholic Center is preparing to open its doors later this year and is perhaps the most important event in the celebration of the 450th anniversary of the Diocese of Macau.
HM asked questions to the Diocese of Macau regarding the reopening of the building, which confirmed that the official opening is scheduled “for the second quarter” of this year. This building, with a total of 17 floors, will have features designed for religious purposes, but also a hotel prepared to receive all types of people.
"The Catholic Center will be a nerve center for disseminating and sharing the mission of the Catholic Church. The lower floors will feature a chapel, an auditorium, conference rooms, exhibition areas and spaces for activities." While “the upper floors will function as a hotel, offering welcoming and comfortable accommodation, imbued with a spirit of service”.
In the diocese's written response, it is added that the hotel facilities “were designed to receive both pilgrims and tourists, welcoming Catholics and non-Catholics with hospitality and inclusion”.
It is worth remembering that in December employees began to be recruited for the hotel unit, in partnership with the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL). In a job matching session aimed at residents, held on December 5th, with the “Companhia de Gestão do Centro Católico”, 23 job openings were made available for sales manager, assistant reception manager, chef, head of security, room service supervisor and acquisition supervisor, reads the DSAL note released in November.
The Diocese of Macau did not want to tell HM how much it would cost to rebuild the new Catholic Center, saying only that initial forecasts had slipped due to the pandemic. "The Catholic Center is currently undergoing development and submission and approval by the Government. Following the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, construction costs have increased significantly. We are grateful for the understanding and support of the builders and contractors, which allowed the reconstruction project to be completed successfully. At the same time, we warmly welcome donations from all sectors of society to help sustain and carry forward the Catholic Center's original mission of serving the Macau community."
A bishop still present
Asked about the main goals of the new Catholic Center, the Diocese of Macau describes that the building “aims to continue the spiritual mission of the Catholic Church and incorporate the spirit of Christ”, influenced by the work of Bishop D. Paulo José Tavares, who carried out his mission in Macau in the mid-20th century.
Of particular note is the fact that D. Paulo José Tavares, who died in 1973 and was appointed Bishop of Macau in 1961, was important in maintaining the presence of the Catholic Church in Macau at the time of the “1,2,3” movement. Between November 1966 and February 1967, the Cultural Revolution manifested itself in the territory, bringing together many local students, who intended to change the content of Catholic education. D. Paulo José Tavares fought with these groups of protesters, managing to keep teaching in Catholic schools and the spirit associated with them unchanged.
In this way, and based on “the vision” of this bishop, the diocese intends for the new Catholic Center to “continue to serve as a vital bridge for the Macau community, promoting dialogue, exchange and integration of faith and culture”. It is also the intention to “open the doors [of the Center] to visitors from all over the world, reinforcing not only its role as a spiritual refuge, but also infusing new vitality into the religious and cultural panorama of Macau”.
António Pedro Costa, author of the cleric's biography, entitled “D. Paulo José Tavares – The diplomat bishop”, described, in an interview with HM in 2023, that the bishop “was a breath of fresh air”, and a figure cherished by the Chinese community at the time.
"These attitudes of valuing the Chinese community led to a rapprochement and the establishment of a relationship of trust. Only in this way was he able to take his objectives forward, as he realized that he had to have the population on his side. But this caused him a lot of trouble with the European clergy, who did not agree with D. Paulo José Tavares' stance. It meant that the population saw him as an ally and not a person who comes from outside and imposes his ideas", said the author.
A year of celebrations
It was in 1576, in the fourth year of the Wanli reign, of the Ming Dynasty, that the Diocese was founded in Macau, with January 23rd being the official date of celebration. However, the next few months will also be festive.
In a previously released statement, the Diocese of Macau states that it has had, over the years, “the mission of establishing bridges between East and West, promoting education, charity and pastoral service”, leaving “a deep and lasting mark on the cultural, educational and religious development of Macau”.
The theme of the celebrations is “From Macau to the World: 450 years of Mission and Mercy”. The new Catholic Center will host two thematic exhibitions, entitled “Honoring the Past, Creating the Future” and “Witness to Heritage, Mission in the World”. These exhibitions aim to “reflect the development of the Diocese from historical, personal and cultural perspectives, as well as its future directions”, highlights the same note.
Tomorrow a sacred music concert will take place at the Sé Church with eight choral groups from Macau, Hong Kong and the Province of Guangzhou, with the sounds of the church's new pipe organ being heard.
From 7:30 pm onwards, the Diocesan Choir of Macau, the Cathedral Schola ensemble and other choral groups from Macau will perform, such as Coro Perosi, Dolce Voce and Cantate Chorus, without forgetting other ensembles from Hong Kong and Guangzhou.
The Diocese highlights that the “most symbolic and large-scale initiative of the commemorative year” will be the “great celebration” scheduled for October 31st this year, which consists of a reception and mass.
“Through this solemn celebration, the Diocese will give thanks to God for the graces and mission granted over four and a half centuries, and will pray that He continues to guide the way forward”, the same statement describes.
There will also be initiatives carried out by “various diocesan institutions” in the coming months, namely “cultural shows, school competitions, academic symposiums, social activities, youth meetings, online training resources, parish initiatives and liturgical celebrations”.
“Through transversal and intergenerational participation, the commemorative year seeks to deepen public knowledge about the historical development of the Diocese and its service to the community, promoting the spirit of the diocesan motto ‘Scientia et Virtus’ (Science and Virtue), which inspires a practice of service based on the balance between knowledge and ethical care.”
At a time when it celebrates 450 years of existence, the Diocese says it wants to chart the future, “walking with the residents of Macau in reflecting on the past and continuing its mission of faith, service and culture in this new stage”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:36:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Higher education | Academic highlights growth of the sector in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/13/ensino-superior-academico-destaca-crescimento-do-sector-em-macau/</link><description>In “Macau, networks, dialogues and affections – The consolidation of the Portuguese-speaking community of China studies”, academic Pedro Steenhagen argues that Macau is taking great strides to be a bridge at an academic level with Portuguese-speaking countries, despite “still having a long way to go to achieve its goals”
The article “Macau, networks, dialogues and affections – The consolidation of the Portuguese-speaking community of China studies”, written by academic and doctoral student Pedro Steenhagen, has just been published in Revista Sinóptica, an editorial project of the Observa China portal. The article highlights the role that the Macao SAR can play in connecting its higher education system with Portuguese-speaking countries, and the growing importance it has had in this area.
“The aforementioned efforts in the field of education are not just rhetorical”, he described in the article, noting that “in relatively few decades, the Asian nation has become a true power in the area”. Pedro Steenhagen is based on two world rankings to assess the quality of higher education in the world, namely the World University Rankings 2026 by Times Higher Education (from 2025), which shows how “Macau, a small special administrative region in China, has three ranked universities: University of Macau (145), University of Science and Technology of Macau (251-300) and University of the City of Macau (601-800)”, these data being related to positions occupied in the ranking.
“Very interestingly, MSAR universities have experienced tremendous growth; for example, the University of Macau has seen a jump of more than 250 positions in the ranking in the last 10 years”, highlights the author of the article. In his view, these data translate into the fact that Macao SAR “assumes an increasingly relevant leadership role in the area of ​​education and research”.
Furthermore, it has “the best university in the Portuguese-speaking world in its territory, is experiencing an intense expansion of the education and research sector and serves as a fundamental axis for the exchange of people and the promotion of knowledge”.
Taking the rankings into account, Pedro Steenhagen's article recalls that China “has five [universities] in the top 50 in the world: Tsinghua University (12), Beijing University (13), Fudan University (36), Zhejiang University (39) and Shanghai Jiaotong University (40)”, with the Times Higher Education ranking “showing a total of 97 results for mainland China”.
Brazil, as “the largest Portuguese-speaking country on the globe, has a total of 59 results, and its five best universities are: University of São Paulo (201-250), State University of Campinas (351-400), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (601-800), Universidade Estadual Paulista (601-800) and Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (601-800)”.
In the case of Portugal, there are 16 results, with the five best higher education establishments being the University of Coimbra, University of Lisbon, University of Porto, Universidade Nova de Lisboa and ISCTE-Instituto Universitário de Lisboa.
Looking at the remaining Portuguese-speaking countries, Pedro Steenhagen highlights how “Mozambique has only one presence in the ranking”, with Eduardo Mondlane University, while “no other Portuguese-speaking country has ranked universities”.
A long way
Despite the good results, Pedro Steenhagen points out that “the Macao SAR still has a long way to go to achieve all its goals”. However, “its enormous potential as a regional and global protagonist in areas such as technology and innovation, sustainable tourism, creative industry, finance and, particularly, teaching, research and people exchange is already quite clear”.
The academic article refers to the “Lusophony component and the unique connection with the PLPs [Portuguese-speaking countries] which adds even more dynamism to its ambitions and to a trajectory that can already be considered incredibly successful since its retrocession”, that is, the transition of the Portuguese administration of Macau to China, in 1999.
In the case of the University of Macau (UM), the first to emerge in Macau, and which is now celebrating 45 years of existence, “it has the largest Portuguese department in Asia”, it is highlighted in the article, in addition to having “two research centers: the Research Center for Portuguese-Asian Studies and the Chinese-Portuguese Bilingual Teaching and Training Center”, with “its growing internationalization movement being notable”.
Pedro Steenhagen counts the “student exchange programs with more than 10 Brazilian universities”, in addition to the strengthening of “collaboration in teaching and research via international alliances, such as the Association of Portuguese Language Universities, and the establishment of the Center for Judicial and Legal Studies of China and Portuguese-speaking Countries”.
The example of the City University of Macau (UCM) is mentioned, where the Institute for Research on Portuguese-Speaking Countries is established, with “unique programs” of master's and doctoral degrees in Studies of Portuguese-Speaking Countries.
By establishing partnerships with ISCTE-IUL, UCM is in a “position at the forefront of academic programs and initiatives that go beyond purely linguistic and cultural issues” in connection with Portuguese-speaking countries.
There is also the example of a private higher education institution, the University of São José, which “signed [agreements], for example, with the Federal University of Ceará and the Portuguese Catholic University, not only to bring closer relations on a bilateral basis, but also to promote joint projects”.
The place of the Government
Pedro Steenhagen also refers to the intervention of the Macao SAR Government in connecting with the Portuguese-speaking world, namely the Directorate of Economic and Technological Development Services and the Macau Business Incubation Center for Young People, which have held the Macau Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition for Technology Companies from Brazil and Portugal since 2021.
Of note is the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in Lisbon and the Macau Houses spread around the world which, “together with international initiatives such as the Meeting of Macanese Communities, contribute not only to the vitality of intellectual exchanges, but also to the cultivation of memory and affective ties between Macau, the diaspora, descendants and Portuguese-speaking communities”.
“Associations such as the Association of Brazilian Studies in Macau and the Industrial and Commercial Association of Macau offer substance, in a complementary way to universities and research institutes, for strengthening relationships, developing networks and generating increasingly fruitful dialogues between the parties involved”, it further reads.
Pedro Steenhagen is a doctoral candidate in the field of International Politics at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs at Fudan University, and president of the Brazilian Citizens' Council in Shanghai. On the Observa China platform, he is development director and coordinator of the China-Brazil and Lusofonia Relations Center. The platform is a think-tank created in 2020 by “a group of young professionals and students with the mission of creating a network to qualify the debate on China in Portuguese”, reads the website.</description><pubDate>2026-01-13 01:02:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Book | Changes in Portuguese colonial policy at the end of the 19th century</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/12/livro-as-mudancas-na-politica-colonial-portuguesa-nos-finais-do-seculo-xix/</link><description>Defended in 2018, the doctoral thesis by Célia Reis, professor and researcher in contemporary History, has just been published in a book by the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center with the support of the Macau Foundation. “The Power between Lisbon and the East – Persistences and Changes in Administration. From the Ultimatum to the Colonial Act” circulates between Macau, India and Timor and brings “a good contribution to the history of colonial power”
Célia Reis, professor and researcher in the area of ​​Contemporary History at Universidade Nova de Lisboa, has just published her doctoral thesis in a book focused on Portuguese colonial power in the East from the end of the 19th century. “Power between Lisbon and the East – Persistences and Changes in Administration. From the Ultimatum to the Colonial Act” is an edition of the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM), supported by the Macau Foundation (FM), and arises from the thesis defended in 2018.
To HM, Célia Reis argued that this book and its research bring “a good contribution to the history of colonial power”, focusing “on the administrative configurations in the colonies of the East, India, Macau and Timor, in the period between the Ultimatum and the Colonial Act”, published in 1930.
“Thousands of documents” were analyzed, namely “formal letters, private letters, reports from departments, drafts, small notes” that demonstrate decisions and the functioning of the Administration in the territories of Portuguese India, Macau and Timor.
We speak, according to the author, of “a time of many experiments, in different phases”, and, for Célia Reis, “a gap that existed in Portuguese historiography” was overcome in the sense of a better understanding of the functioning of Portuguese colonial power in these years, and specifically in the territories to the East.
In the case of Macau, the book and study contribute “to an administrative history of the period in question”, namely “why it was decided, how it was decided; what problems were posed at an administrative level; how the power of Lisbon was felt and how it was resolved, or how it sought to influence the central power; or who represented it”.
The territory is also placed “alongside two other spaces, India and Timor, which are very different, enabling a comparative history, an emphasis on what was common or specific, which, without a doubt, is essential for deeper knowledge”.  Célia Reis says she is “very happy with the publication”, for being able to “share the work, investigations and their results, with the public, helping to better understand the history and lived realities”.
Historical adjustments
The years dedicated to this research show many changes in colonial policy, taking into account that “the colonization movement seen from the last decades of the 19th century was reflected in the way of governing the colonies, giving rise to discussions, studies and adaptations to realities”.
Célia Reis further explained that “the existing framework, which had been institutionalized since 1869, was being altered by the creation of new departments, the introduction of new forms of financial control or the change in the status and organization of some colonies, making the administration less homogeneous than was seen in many speeches”.
At issue is, in particular, a decree dated December 1, 1869, which proved to be the “true organic charter of the Overseas Provinces”, as stated in the conclusion of the work, without forgetting the Administrative Code of 1842, which “shaped the overseas political bodies for decades”.
“Although they lead to a continuous model, in the bodies and their functions, they did not prevent the progressive organization of new configurations or the adaptation of different structures”, we also read.
The researcher highlights the occurrence of successive attempts at modernization in legislative and administrative terms, even before the implementation of the First Republic. “Several proposals for modifications were made, with a more modernizing intention, and which had greater emphasis from the last years of the Monarchy, continuing later through the Republic for a more structured change, which ended up being carried out by laws published in 1914 and 1920”.
From October 5, 1910, when the Monarchy fell and a republican regime was established, there was “a ministerial change, with the assumption of reference to colonies replacing Ultramar and the autonomy of its ministry”.
"In overseas areas, the change of regime was understood as an opportunity for administrative renewal, as can be understood by India's proposal, or by the openness expressed by government bodies to changes in Macau. But the new republican regime remained, in the field of colonial administration, trapped in the circumstances of its beginning, by constitutionalizing it.
In fact, in the wide range of changes, colonial issues constituted only one part and parliamentarians did not dedicate themselves sufficiently to them, despite the existence of proposals”, reads the conclusion of the work.
In the years of Republicanism, there was “political processing that imposed a framework of parliamentarism, due to some distrust towards the Executive”, and at the level of the colonies “this option led to greater interference by the Senate in the appointment of governors, moving away from what were considered more effective models”.
Furthermore, “the rupture also did not take place in the field of participation in Congress, where overseas territories maintained their space in the political game”. "The republican decision also showed a conservative nature in relation to municipal bodies. As it was not possible to carry out a more in-depth study here, it was found that the political vision based on the importance of the municipality, as a space for participation, prevented the deeper changes that were proposed for the internal organization", is mentioned in the conclusion.
Barriers and control
“Obstacles occurred, such as Sidonism”, followed, with attempts at change being found to be “insufficient”. It should be noted that Sidonism had its origins in a military coup carried out by Sidónio Pais against the republican regime in force in those years, since 1910, and which operated between 1917 and 1918. It was an authoritarian and militaristic regime.
According to Célia Reis, it was after the Military Dictatorship of 1926 that “we moved towards greater control” in terms of colonial policy.
In general terms, “the regime that began on October 5th was, in short, modernizing in some sense, but its political conceptions and the insertion of colonial issues in the broader space of changes to be carried out in the country allowed the persistence of many previous modes”.
“Despite these limitations, the 1914 laws undoubtedly constituted a modernizing step, replacing the existing framework”, concluded Célia Reis, referring to the years of Sidonism as “a rupture in the path that was being followed, with the retreat of colonial capabilities, particularly collegiate bodies and local participation, as well as a decrease in financial autonomy”. This “political trend” experienced in the then metropolis ended up “transplanted overseas”.
In terms of documentation used in this investigation, we have the example of the Organic Charters, implemented by Portugal for each colony, and which “arose following the laws of 1914”, analyzing “the various proposals existing in India, Macau and Timor, their implementation process, the essential characteristics of those that belonged to those colonies and their subsequent trajectory”.
According to the investigation, “they were the product of the moment in which they took place, inserted in a broader change introduced in Portugal by the Republic, which conditioned their existence, firstly due to the different contributions they had and, later, due to the lack of definition of their situation”.
This study analyzes “the way in which central and colonial decisions were operationalized”, having considered “governmental and parliamentary structures”. In the case of colonies, “their organs of power” were studied, where “the governor, interlocutor between metropolis and colony, acted, examining his capabilities and possibility of action, when he was under the authority of a distant ministry, but alongside other supervisory powers, particularly financial, Councils and, in general, under pressure from the various forces of the colony”.
In the case of the “competences and composition of the various Councils and means of financial control” they have experienced, in these years, “a change, much more pronounced throughout the various reforms; mainly integrating civil servants”. Furthermore, “the combination of other elements of local society proved to be different, depending on the colonies”.
Lisbon Orders
Célia Reis describes that “local deliberations were dependent on superior sanction and remained so beyond the reforms”, and “the practice often circumvented the norm, maintaining uncertainty as a form of action”.
Another point to highlight in this study is how the fact that Lisbon made the most important decisions affected life in the colonies.
"Although the mandatory sanction remained, the legislation introduced changes, mainly based on the establishment of deadlines. Nevertheless, the metropolitan decision-making capacity remained essential, affecting the life of the colonies. The forms used, persisting what existed or changing the framework, essentially constituted adaptations to the circumstances that occurred, responding both to foreign models and to the needs imposed on Portuguese realities. Politics, in its instability and phases of change, also determined this path", he said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>University of Macau | Former teachers recall experiences</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/09/universidade-de-macau-antigos-docentes-recordam-experiencias/</link><description>The University of Macau celebrates 45 years and HM invited two former professors to recall their professional experiences at the institution. Brian Hall, from the field of psychology, found “the ideal environment” to start his career. Vera Lúcia Raposo says she “learned a lot” and saw Law as a “meeting place”
A series of events begins this Sunday to celebrate the 45 years of existence of the University of Macau (UM), including the “Open Day” which takes place at the Lakeside Theater between 11am and 5pm (see secondary text). It was in March 1981, still under the name of the University of East Asia, that UM began to take its first steps in local higher education, namely in the teaching of Law in the Portuguese language.
It was the first time that Macau had its own university, providing a higher education offering for residents, who no longer only had the opportunity to pursue studies abroad, such as Portugal, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong or Australia.
To commemorate the anniversary, HM invited two former professors of the institution, from two different academic areas, to talk about their experience at UM.
Vera Lúcia Raposo, who taught at the Faculty of Law from January 2014, remembers feeling “a shock”. "The classes were entirely in English, and I had never taught a complete course in that language, the pressure to publish in indexed journals was absolute and the evaluation system was periodic, demanding and relentless. Nothing there resembled the regime I was used to, where the simple passage of time often seemed to guarantee the natural advancement of an academic career", she said.
However, adaptation arrived and ended up following “the rules” to this day, namely at NOVA School of Law. “At the time, however, these requirements were still profoundly strange in Portugal, and they continue to be so, in many contexts, even today”, he says.
Vera Lúcia Raposo says she “learned a lot” at UM, as “the demanding scientific production goals and interdisciplinary research contributed to defining the type of academic I am today”. “I owe UM more than a professional transition, but a transformation”, he assures.
A cultural melting pot
The former professor at the UM Faculty of Law also remembers arriving in a territory that was “a space of true cultural amalgamation”, with the institution being an example of this.
"Working side by side with colleagues of different nationalities and cultures was a rare privilege. In particular, the intellectual coexistence between Chinese, Macanese and Portuguese colleagues, in the study and teaching of Macau Law, offered me an absolutely unique way of thinking about Law: less self-centered, more dialoguing, more aware of its cultural and historical contingency", highlighted Vera Lúcia Raposo.
Brian Hall, who taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and coordinated the “Global and Community Mental Health Research Group”, highlights the possibility of doing pioneering work in the area of ​​mental health. "UM gave me the opportunity to develop unique and never-before-taught courses in Global Mental Health and Global Health. They were the first courses of their kind in Macau and at the university", recalled Brian Hall, who is now linked to New York University Shanghai.
“I was grateful to have some really great students who were interested in topics like migration, global and digital mental health, and I really enjoyed mentoring them in and out of the classroom.”
The first prizes
The academic also highlights the fact that he “regularly published research articles with undergraduate and postgraduate students, taking them to international research conferences, where they won awards”. “We were among the first at the university to achieve these excellent results and I am eternally grateful to UM for providing me with all these opportunities”, he confessed.
Brian Hall also added that he joined UM “in a period of ambitious transition and growth to become a research university”, providing “an ideal environment to launch a career”. When he was at UM, Brian Hall received, in 2020, an award for his work, the “Excellence in Advising Award” from the Center for Global Health at Johns Hopkins University, from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
"The university rewarded me for my excellent research performance by granting me permission to apply for an early promotion to associate professor, which I was granted just four years after joining the university. UM served as a springboard to build a regional and international career," he said.
Book of Genesis
The need to create a university in Macau arose from the desire to develop the territory, especially taking into account the signing of the Joint Declaration between Portugal and China in 1987.
The former Governor of Macau Garcia Leandro recalled the first moments of the creation of the future university in the book “Macau in the Years of the Portuguese Revolution 1974-1979”, which reads that the initial budget was 40 million patacas for construction “on land on the island of Taipa, with a modern architectural project”.
The institution should have capacity for “a population of two thousand students in four years, at a rate of 500 per year”, with “the leadership of the various course chairs guaranteed by a dean professor with a doctorate from the University of Oxford and by several university professors from Matteo Ricci, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and also from the USA”, it is described.
The first contract to train the teaching team and pedagogical content was signed in February 1979 with the Matteo Ricci group. “I believe it was another good service provided to the population”, wrote the former Governor. In 1991, the institution changed its name to what it currently has.
According to data from the 2024 annual report, the latest available, UM has 52,146 graduated students, and in the first semester of the 2024/2025 academic year, 15,147 students attended the university, from all educational levels. Highlight is the greater number of students from abroad, 9,328, compared to 5,819 local students.
Open day in Hengqin
Despite having been formally created in March, UM begins to celebrate 45 years of existence this Sunday with an Open Day. According to a statement from the educational institution, between 11am and 5pm the public will be able to visit the Lakeside Theater, where the first ceremony takes place, and then other areas of the campus in Hengqin, namely the main campus and the UM Scientific and Technological Research Institute in Zhuhai, in the Youth Entrepreneurship Valley in Hengqin.
This route also includes the possibility of visiting, for the first time, the Transitional Research and Education Site at Yuxin Tower, in the Cooperation Zone. “Through a wide range of on-site activities and live online broadcasts, the event will showcase UM’s latest developments and achievements in teaching, research and community service”, highlights the same note, which recalls how UM was the first higher education institution in Macau to “extend teaching and research activities to the Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin”.
On that day there will also be “approximately 250 activities on the main campus throughout the day, including admissions lectures, academic and research activities and interactive games”.
"Visitors interested in academic subjects can attend engaging lectures on science and other disciplines, while sports enthusiasts can explore UM's sports facilities. Families can also participate in interactive games at stands, scientific experiments, workshops and knowledge challenges organized by various faculties, residences and laboratories", it is revealed. On Open Day there will also be discounts in the restaurant area.</description><pubDate>2026-01-09 02:07:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Patriotism | Sam Hou Fai emphasizes priority to national interests</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/patriotismo-sam-hou-fai-salienta-prioridade-a-interesses-nacionais/</link><description>“We always put the safeguarding of sovereignty, security and national development interests first, resolutely implementing the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’”, stated the Chief Executive in a speech given yesterday at the reception of the Spring party hosted by the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao SAR.
Sam Hou Fai summarized last year's political action, with particular emphasis on national integration and defense of state security. "Within the scope of safeguarding national security, we took decisive measures, handling cases in accordance with the law, in order to resolutely prevent and prevent infiltration and interference by external forces. This ensured the effective maintenance of stability and harmony in Macau", said the local politician.
The leader of the Executive mentioned Xi Jinping's instructions several times, namely the phrase, which has “always present”, “Prosperity should not induce complacency, nor does security justify forgetting danger”.
Stating that 2026 is a crucial year for alignment with national strategies, Sam Hou Fai reinforced the promise to maintain stability. “We will continue to implement the principle of ‘one country, two systems’ in a comprehensive, precise and resolute manner, firmly safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests and resolutely upholding the insurmountable line that ‘there can be no chaos in Macau’.”</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:43:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Borders | Goods now have a single customs declaration</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/fronteiras-mercadorias-passam-a-ter-declaracao-alfandegaria-unica/</link><description>A service that allows the delivery of just one customs declaration for the passage of goods between Guangdong and Macau went into operation yesterday, on an experimental basis, the Directorate of Economic and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) said yesterday.
Therefore, companies only need to fill in the declaration data once and the information will be shared between the authorities in Mainland China and Macau. DSEDT states that the measure aims to improve “the level of facilitation of cross-border trade, better serving economic development and better meeting the needs of society”.
The Macao SAR services department adds that the so-called “single window” for goods from Guangdong and Macau aims to provide facilitated customs clearance services through digitalized and computerized means to companies exporting from Mainland China and importing from Macau, shortening the time spent on customs declaration.
The Government also indicates that the new service helps to reduce labor costs and time, without the need to repeat data entry, as well as to reduce errors and increase efficiency.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:41:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Presidential | Portuguese choose President over the weekend</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/presidenciais-portugueses-escolhem-presidente-no-fim-de-semana/</link><description>Tomorrow and Sunday, Portuguese people residing in Macau will be able to vote in the Consultado-Geral to choose the next President of the Portuguese Republic. The polls will be open on both days, from 8am to 7pm, after three days of early voting in which 78 voters participated, more than triple the number of those in the first round
The Portuguese will once again be called upon to vote in the second round of elections to elect the next President of the Republic, in a vote contested between candidates from the Socialist Party (António José Seguro) and Chega (André Ventura).
In the Macao SAR, Portuguese people will be able to vote on Saturday and Sunday, from 8am to 7pm, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, just like voters who will vote abroad in the various diplomatic missions around the world.
Remember that only national citizens who are registered abroad will be able to vote. To choose the next President of the Republic, voters must present a citizen card, identity card, or document that has an up-to-date photograph and is usually used for identification (passport or driving license).
On the 27th, 28th and 29th of January, the consulate general received voters who voted in advance. This modality of suffrage was open to voters due to "the exercise of public or private functions, representing a national team. In addition, students, researchers, teachers and research fellows at a higher education institution, patients undergoing treatment, or voters accompanying the aforementioned citizens were able to vote in advance.
According to information revealed by the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong to HM, 78 voters voted in advance in the second round, more than triple the number of early votes in the first round, when 25 early votes were counted.
Local vs National
In the first round, the votes counted in Macau gave an advantage to the PSD candidate, Luís Marques Mendes, with 47.19 percent of the votes, followed by the socialist António José Seguro (20.98 percent) and André Ventura with 12.4 percent.
At national level, António José Seguro won the first round with 1,755,563 votes (31.11 percent), followed by André Ventura, with 1,327,021 votes (23.52 percent) and João Cotrim Figueiredo, with 903,057 votes (16 percent). Luís Marques Mendes ended up in fifth place, out of the second round with 637,442 votes (11.3 percent).</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:40:15</pubDate></item><item><title>National Security | Lawyers excluded with no chance of appealing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/seguranca-nacional-advogados-excluidos-sem-hipotese-de-recorrer/</link><description>Processes classified as national security will cover criminal cases, but can also extend to administrative and civil areas. Lawyers will be required to present information about households, such as nationality and foreign political connections
Lawyers who are excluded from trials related to national security by the Macao SAR State Security Defense Commission (CDSE) are prevented from filing an appeal to challenge the decision. The information is contained in the Government's proposal published yesterday on the Legislative Assembly portal and which deprives defendants of the possibility of freely choosing any lawyer registered with the Macau Lawyers Association.
According to the procedures defined in the bill, the State Security Defense Commission will choose the lawyer for the defendants “in judicial proceedings of any nature in which the competent authority has well-founded reasons to believe that there is a need to protect the interests of State security”. According to this formulation, the exclusion of a lawyer may occur in criminal proceedings, such as the one currently underway against former deputy Au Kam San, but also in administrative or even private law proceedings, if it is considered that in some way “there is a need to protect the interests of State security”.
Within the scope of the ongoing process, even before being chosen as representative, the lawyer must go to court and inform the judge of his desire to be appointed as a representative of one of the parties involved. From this moment on, an analysis of the lawyer and his family begins, which may require the obligation to present elements such as the lawyer's own nationality, members of his family and connections with organizations or individuals abroad, among “others”.
This formulation thus opens the door for family members to have to declare their affiliation with political parties outside Macau. However, the required elements are not specified in the proposed law.
If the judge considers that the elements provided by the lawyers initially are not sufficient, he may also require the presentation of “other information that he considers essential for verification”.
The Boss decides
Once the information has been collected, the CDSE decides whether it considers that the lawyer corresponds to the will of the political power for the specific case, issuing an opinion granting or refusing the “special authorization to the judicial representative”.
The criteria that will be adopted by the Chief Executive, the secretaries, advisors to the Central Government, who do not vote, and other members of the Government linked to the police and other entities were not revealed. However, the law eliminates the possibility of judicial appeal or challenge within the commission itself.
The Government's proposal thus adopts the policy of the electoral law for deputies, with the difference that the removal of a lawyer from a specific case does not prevent him from practicing the profession, nor from submitting new requests in the future, without being “frozen” for five years.
Contrary to what happens with judges, the diploma does not exclude the participation of Portuguese lawyers in processes of this nature.
Outside the control of the courts
The law also defines the powers of the CDSE, which will have the power to issue orders to all public entities involved with the objectives of defending the security of the State, ensuring the prosperity and stability of the Macao SAR and guaranteeing the legitimate rights and interests of the residents of the Macao SAR and other people in the SAR.
The diploma also confirms the CDSE's competence to issue binding opinions in relation to the elections for the Chief Executive and the Legislative Assembly.
However, the law brings something new: the principle that the authorities' decisions follow the CDSE's opinions, not accepting challenges or legal action, unless there is a legal norm providing for this appeal.
The Sam Hou Fai Government's proposal also defines that the commission's work “is free from any interference from other entities or individuals in the Macao SAR”, with no public information about the commission or its work being made available.
Within the scope of the principle of secrecy, the commission can also hire the workers it deems necessary, and carry out expenses without the need for disclosure. The accounts will only be analyzed by the Chief Executive, who also presides over the CDSE.
Ongoing process
The Government's proposal for the new CDSE law is justified in the documents sent to the Legislative Assembly with the need to improve the “legal system and reinforce the top structure of the State security defense system”, to “firmly safeguard the sovereignty, security and development interests of the State, build a solid barrier to defend the State's security and maintain the general stability of society”.
The Executive also indicates that the changes aim to “effectively prevent and repress external interference and ensure that the State’s security interests are not harmed”.
The proposed law enters the hemicycle at a time when the investigation into former deputy Au Kam San is expected to be concluded, the only case made public in the Macao SAR related to national security.
Arrested in July last year, the Democrat has been in pre-trial detention ever since. If the law is approved before a possible trial, the process may follow the stipulations of the diploma.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:38:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Hengqin New District | Residents can now buy two apartments</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/novo-bairro-hengqin-residentes-ja-podem-comprar-dois-apartamentos/</link><description>From now on, Macau residents will be able to buy two apartments in the New Macau District in Henqgin. The decision was announced by the Executive Committee of the Deep Cooperation Zone, which justified the measure with the “optimization of the housing stock”
Political authorities in the Guangdong-Macao In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin have once again eased restrictions on the purchase of apartments in Macau's New District on Mountain Island. This time, the Executive Committee of the Deep Cooperation Zone announced that Macao SAR residents can purchase two apartments in the housing complex built for the population of Macau.
The measure was presented as a way to “implement the spirit of directives from the national and provincial authorities of Guangdong to optimize the existing housing stock, adjust housing purchase restriction policies” and “effectively expand quality living space for Macau residents”. The executive committee also adds that the possibility of purchasing two apartments aims to “respond to public concerns”.
Furthermore, it is indicated that if problems occur in implementing the measure, the Hengqin Urban Planning and Construction Services Bureau is the entity that should be contacted directly.
The executive committee also cites the “current development of the cooperation zone” and the “response to demands from the business sector” as reasons for changing the restrictions on purchasing housing in the New Neighborhood of Macau.
Fewer barriers
Last September, Macau Urban Renewal announced the start of sales of units in Tower 11 of the housing complex, with special discounted prices for parking spaces, renovation works and the purchase of electrical appliances.
Since sales of units in the housing complex began, several restrictions on transactions have been lifted. Criteria have been adjusted, including removing the age limit, allowing minors to own property, removing the restriction on resale within five years of purchase, and adjusting the limit on purchasing residential units.
Furthermore, in mid-2024, in the midst of the real estate crisis, the initial concept of the New Macau Neighborhood in Hengqin was changed to increase occupancy. Instead of purchases by residents of the Macao SAR, the authorities of the cooperation zone began to allow rental of units to students from Mainland China, as well as employees of the University of Macau, the Hengqin School Annex to the Hou Kong School and the Medical Post of the New Neighborhood of Macau.
The New Neighborhood of Macau is made up of 27 residential towers, with approximately 4,000 housing units.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 05:44:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Chief of Executive highlights contributions from the City University of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/chefe-do-executivo-destaca-contributos-da-universidade-cidade-de-macau/</link><description>The Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, met this Tuesday with Chan Meng Kam, businessman, former deputy and also chancellor and president of the Board of Directors of the City University of Macau (UCM).
The meeting served to discuss “the development of higher education in Macau and the training of qualified staff”, with the Chief Executive highlighting that, at a time when UCM celebrates 45 years of existence, “it has actively responded to the guidelines and directives of the Country and the MSAR in the field of higher education, having achieved widely recognized results in improving the quality of education, training qualified staff, scientific innovation and service to society”.
Sam Hou Fai also understands that the higher education institution “is aligned with the development strategy of adequate diversification ‘1+4′”, having achieved “significant results in boosting interdisciplinary development and building an international and comprehensive institution”.
Plan the future
In the meeting with Chan Meng Kam, the highest ruler of the Macao SAR did not neglect the advice. The UCM must “adapt to the needs of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in terms of industrial development and qualified staff, optimize curricula in emerging disciplines, such as artificial intelligence, Big Health, finance and technology”, in addition to “promoting the transformation of scientific research results and their application”.
The UCM was also asked to “train more high-quality qualified staff with practical knowledge”, in addition to “continuing to expand international exchange channels”.

The Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, and the new commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MNE) in Macau, Bian Lixin, met on Tuesday to discuss Macau's foreign policy issues. The meeting took place behind closed doors and was announced in a press release by the Social Communication Office.
During the meeting, Sam Hou Fai stated that the Government “is determined to leverage Macau’s position as ‘a center, a platform and a base’” and “fully utilize its advantages in connecting domestic and international markets and fusing Chinese and Western cultures”. In this sense, the leader indicated that he will “actively promote the strategy of ‘expanding abroad and attracting investment’ and constantly increase its competitiveness and international influence”.
Sam Hou Fai told Bian that “visits abroad are being planned for this year and there are plans to establish an economic and commercial delegation in Southeast Asian countries, with the aim of further expanding the tourist market and consolidating Macau’s position as a global tourism and leisure center”. One of these visits should include trips to Portugal and Spain, which were initially scheduled for the 16th to 23rd of September, but ended up being postponed.
Thanks to MNE
At the meeting, Sam Hou Fai thanked the MNE for the “strong support to the territory, helping the Macao SAR to respond to various internal and external challenges”, which were not indicated.
The highest leader of the Macao SAR also pointed out that over the years the MNE has supported Macau “in valuing its unique advantages”, “in expanding exchange and cooperation with the outside world”, “in expanding external contacts” and “in strengthening its capabilities for governing external relations”.
Sam Hou Fai also highlighted the “full protection of the rights and interests of Macau residents abroad” by the MNE and the “impetus for the development of adequate diversification of the economy”.
This was the first publicized meeting between Sam and Bian Lixin, the new MNE commissioner who arrived in Macau at the end of January to succeed Liu Xianfa.
Principles and barriers
In turn, according to the version of the meeting of the MNE Commissioner in Macau, Bian Lixin highlighted that she felt “deeply honored” to have been appointed the eighth Commissioner of the MNE in Macau.
Bian also highlighted “the tremendous developments achieved by Macau at an economic and social level in the last 26 years”, which in his opinion demonstrate “the institutional advantages and strong vitality of the ‘one country, two systems’ principle”.
At the same time, the new person in charge assured that the commissioner will implement “with determination the important decisions and plans of the Central Government regarding external relations and work related to Macau” and that “it will firmly build a strong national security barrier” and “will deeply practice the concepts of ‘diplomacy for the benefit of Macau’ and ‘diplomacy for the people’”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 05:41:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Predominance of executive power</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/predominancia-do-poder-executivo/</link><description>In early 2026, Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, spoke at a seminar on the topic of “persisting and improving the predominance of executive power to boost the good governance of Special Administrative Regions”. The audience included the Chief Executives of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as members of the plenary sessions from both regions.
According to the “Basic Laws” of both regions, the Chief Executive is responsible to the Central People's Government and his Special Administrative Region. In his speech, Xia Baolong highlighted that "the Chief Executive plays a crucial role and assumes significant responsibilities. He must effectively exercise the powers conferred by law, fully assume the responsibility of leading the Special Administrative Region and manage his 'house' well... striving to build an efficient and competent government." The higher the position, the greater the responsibility.
The Chief Executive must assume full responsibility for the Special Administrative Region and needs to form an efficient and well-prepared Government; the responsibility is significant and the task is arduous. How to make the most of the advantages of the predominance of executive power will undoubtedly be the biggest test for the Chief Executives of both regions.
The Government exists to “serve the people”, and people's degree of satisfaction and happiness is the criterion that assesses whether performance matches aspirations. If members of the Government (civil servants) cannot obtain the approval of the people, replacing them is a reasonable option. Many members of the Central Government were dismissed or detained for corruption and neglect of duty, demonstrating that no one is above the law. Since the return of Hong Kong and Macau to Chinese sovereignty, both regions have developed and progressed, but there are also limitations. Good governance is not based on empty speeches. What is clearly expressed in Xia's speech is the hope for improving and strengthening governance capacity.
Let us remember the terrible fire in Tai Po, Hong Kong, which occurred at the end of last year, which is still being investigated by an independent committee. We do not know how many members of the Government will be held responsible for the incident. Furthermore, the recent measure that requires passengers to wear seat belts on public transport went through a lot of setbacks before it was implemented. For example, how can a pregnant woman be forced to wear a seat belt at the end of her term? How to deal with elderly people who prefer to stand up so they don't wear a seat belt?
In Macau, with the promulgation and implementation of Law No. 5/2025 “Law on the Activity of Travel Agencies and the Tourist Guide Profession”, travel agencies are not authorized to provide shuttle bus services to inhabitants of large residential neighborhoods, which makes travel problematic, especially for domestic workers and children.
With more than 40 million tourists expected to visit Macau in 2025, the capacity of public transport has been systematically tested. Although the city government has not implemented regulations against overcrowding of these vehicles, passengers continue to board buses at designated exit-only stops. The patience and tolerance of Macau residents are extraordinary, but faced with the popularity of online shopping and in mainland China, stores are emptying across the city. Even after they are renovated, when they open again, the owners are not sure how long their businesses will last. The “2026 Consumer Carnival in the North Zone” initiative demonstrates that the Macau SAR Government still needs to work to achieve good governance.
Last year, when Chief Executive Sam Hou Fai invited representatives of the Portuguese and English-speaking media to the annual meal, he highly praised their professionalism, concern for social well-being and supervision of the Government's performance. At the same meeting in 2026, Chief Executive Sam Hou Fai expressed the hope that they would continue to pay attention and support the performance of the Macao SAR Government in its various aspects, reflect the living conditions of the population and offer their valid suggestions.
In the context of the predominance of executive power in 2026, the media should not be limited to being an instrument of propaganda or a platform for praise, but rather play the role of advisor, supervisor and partner to help the Macao SAR Government achieve good governance.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 02:08:07</pubDate></item><item><title>The Little Ice Age and its social implications</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/a-pequena-idade-do-gelo-e-as-suas-implicacoes-sociais/</link><description>Concern about the sustainability of our planet is not new. According to Professor José Pinto Peixoto1 (1922-1996), in his book “Influence of Man on Climate and Environment”2, mentioning an extract from the Book of Isaiah3, “The Earth is desolate and withered; Heaven and Earth are fading. The Earth is desecrated by its inhabitants, because they transgress the law and violate the right…”.
In reality, the harmful action that the species Homo sapiens exerts on nature has intensified since around 10,000 years ago, when the agricultural revolution underwent a great increase, when man largely abandoned his activities as hunter-gatherers. With this quote, Professor JPP intended to illustrate that in ancient times there were people who were concerned about what man could do to our planet. By definition, a prophet is someone who serves as an intermediary between the divine and the people, and this text can be interpreted as a warning about the intensification of aggressions that our species would practice, and which led to the current ecological and climate crisis.
Life on our planet is only possible due to a series of circumstances, including the Earth being at a distance from the Sun suitable for the existence of liquid water, a breathable atmosphere and a magnetic field that serves as a protector against electrically charged particles emitted by the Sun (solar wind), which prevents the surface from being reached by part of the radiation that is harmful to life.
Since the Earth's atmosphere was formed, its characteristics have always evolved, in terms of composition and meteorological and climatic parameters. Climate change has greatly influenced human history, shaping the behavior of Homo sapiens.
They have been one of the main causes of great migrations and, consequently, the emergence of different civilizations. Research in the area of ​​paleoclimatology allows us to conclude that, for millions of years, the climate was characterized by glacial and interglacial periods. During the most recent glaciation, ice invaded large areas of Europe and Asia, causing populations to migrate to lower latitudes. Around 6,000 years ago, the prolonged drought that caused the desertification of the region where the Sahara is located, caused people to flee to the Nile River valley, where a civilization flourished whose testimonies are still a source of admiration and study today.
In the last million years there have been approximately six glacial periods. Although we are currently in an interglacial period, there have been shorter periods characterized by relatively low temperatures, such as what is known as the “little ice age”, between the 14th and 19th centuries. There is no unanimity about the beginning, and some historians consider that it began later, in the 16th century. There is, however, consensus that this period was characterized by harsh winters and short summers. The cause of this cooling is still debated today, which could have been a consequence of several natural factors, such as the decrease in solar activity and the increase in the concentration of particles in the atmosphere resulting from volcanic activity and the consequent reduction in radiation reaching the surface.
According to some historians, the “little ice age” may have been one of the causes of social upheavals.
Thus, in the United States of America, in 1692, a social phenomenon occurred that consisted of collective hysteria on the part of the population of Salem, a town in the State of Massachusetts, which resulted in a series of trials, mostly involving women accused of witchcraft. A succession of years with poor agricultural results and consequent food shortages contributed to the perception of insecurity among the populations of the New England region. Faced with this situation, the collective psychological climate contributed to hundreds of women being treated as scapegoats, some of whom were executed by hanging. This subject has been studied by several historians and served as the subject of plays, literary works and films. The most emblematic work was the play by Arthur Miller (“The Crucible” – 1953), in which the author explored this social phenomenon as a metaphor for McCarthyism, a period in US history between the late 1940s and mid-1950s, characterized by the persecution of alleged communists, inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy. The author himself was a victim of this persecution. There were several literary works on the same subject, perhaps the most striking being the non-fiction work “The Witches: Salem, 1692” by American writer Stacy Schiff. Arthur Miller's play was adapted by Arthur Miller for the cinema in 1996, and the film was distributed in Portugal with the title “The Witches of Salem”.
It was also during the Little Ice Age that great social instability occurred that preceded the start of the French Revolution. Popular dissatisfaction caused by widespread hunger due to successive natural disasters, such as a severe drought in 1788 interrupted by intense hail and hailstorms that caused the loss of a large part of the crops that had resisted. To make matters worse, the winter of 1788/1789 was extremely harsh.
The melting of thick layers of snow and ice caused floods and floods the following spring, in much of France, causing serious destruction of infrastructure and almost all of the few crops that remained. Following these meteorological disasters, an outbreak of plague emerged that wiped out many of the animals that had been saved. Hunger resulted from these events and chaos ensued in large urban centers. The summer of 1789 was extremely dry, which contributed to the worsening of the situation. This entire sequence of events, together with the ineffectiveness of Louis XVI's government, contributed to social unrest, which may have constituted a kind of trigger to trigger the French revolution, one of the most notable episodes of which was the Storming of the Bastille, on July 14, 1789.
It can be concluded that meteorological phenomena that, as a whole, characterize the climate of a region, contribute greatly to the worsening of social crises. For example, the recent storm that hit Portugal on January 27, 2026 (the Kristin depression, resulting from explosive cyclogenesis) generated, on the part of the affected population, a feeling of unease in relation to political power. Another example was the drought that reached its peak in 2017, which caused serious damage to agriculture, livestock, water resources and a strong environmental impact in terms of forest fires that caused dozens of fatalities.
In both cases, the political power was accused, by the affected population, of not having taken the necessary measures to minimize the serious consequences that resulted from these natural disasters. Regardless of governments, natural disasters generally cause, rightly or wrongly, the feeling, on the part of the population, that their consequences could be minimized if more efficient preventive measures had been taken, such as, for example, improving forest management, strengthening infrastructure and more rigorous early weather warnings.

The performative dimension of foreign policy plays a central role here. The possibility of taking territory from an ally, even through negotiation, would project an image of strength and unpredictability. For the White House, this unpredictability would function as a deterrent against strategic adversaries, namely Russia and China. The idea that the United States would be willing to consider bold actions in unlikely scenarios would reinforce the credibility of its threats and promises in the international system.
The “capture of Maduro” is an element that would have made the use of force in unexpected contexts more plausible. Regardless of the factuality of this episode, it illustrates the internal logic of the Trump administration with high-impact actions, even if controversial, that would serve to demonstrate determination and capacity for action, creating a favorable environment to pressure partners and adversaries. In this context, Greenland would emerge as the next step in a shock strategy aimed at unlocking negotiations with Copenhagen.
Although Trump's motivations have their own characteristics, there is a point of convergence between his vision and the structural interests of the American State, which is the possibility of strengthening the military presence in Greenland through the installation of a nuclear arsenal. This hypothesis is part of the logic of strategic deterrence that has guided United States defense policy since the post-war period.
Greenland's geographic proximity to the Eurasian space would make the territory a privileged location for positioning weapons capable of quickly responding to threats from Russia or China. The modernization of nuclear forces, in a context of deteriorating arms control treaties, increases the likelihood that Washington will look for new places to reinforce its strategic posture. Greenland, due to its location and existing legal framework, offers particularly favorable conditions.
The convergence between the symbolic ambition of the presidency and the military interests of the State thus creates a common ground that can explain the American insistence on increasing its influence on the island. Even if territorial acquisition is not necessary to achieve these objectives, the possibility of reinforcing the military presence may have contributed to legitimizing, internally, the presidential initiative.
Denmark's position constitutes another essential element in understanding the dynamics surrounding Greenland. Although formally sovereign over the island, Copenhagen faces structural limitations that condition its ability to resist American pressure. Economic and military dependence on the United States, combined with the importance of NATO for European security, reduces the Danish room for maneuver.
Greenland has significant internal autonomy, but remains integrated into the Kingdom of Denmark. Its population, although small, has claimed greater control over natural resources and strategic decisions that affect the territory. The American purchase proposal placed Copenhagen in a delicate position in that rejecting the offer meant contradicting a fundamental ally and accepting it would imply giving up a territory that, despite being remote, has increasing symbolic and strategic value.
A recusa dinamarquesa, amplamente divulgada, não eliminou a pressão americana. On the contrary, it highlighted the fragility of the European position in the Arctic and the difficulty of reconciling national interests with the reality of an international system marked by competition between great powers.
The controversy surrounding Greenland cannot be analyzed in isolation as it reflects broader transformations in the international order, including the growing militarization of the Arctic, competition for strategic resources, the redefinition of traditional alliances, the emergence of political leaders that favor symbolic gestures of great impact and the erosion of diplomatic norms that, for decades, regulated relations between allies.
The proposal to purchase Greenland, although unlikely to materialize, made visible how the territory became a central piece in a global power game. The island, once peripheral, is today a space where economic, military and symbolic interests of great magnitude intersect.
Thus, the analysis of American interest in Greenland reveals a complex combination of structural and cyclical factors. On the one hand, Washington seeks to ensure control of a territory essential to its military strategy and access to critical resources. On the other hand, Donald Trump's presidency introduced a symbolic and political dimension that goes beyond traditional foreign policy calculations. The attempt to acquire Greenland should not be interpreted simply as presidential eccentricity, but as an expression of a vision of power that combines historical ambition, nationalism and a strategy of calculated unpredictability. The partial convergence between this vision and the interests of the American State explains the persistence of the topic and its relevance in the international debate.
Greenland, located between continents and between logics of power, has become a mirror of the tensions that shape the 21st century. The dispute over its future will continue to reflect not only the competition between States, but also the way they seek to redefine their place in a world undergoing rapid transformation.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 06:02:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Hotel Timor</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/04/hotel-timor/</link><description>Hotel Timor (2025) is the latest novel by Timorese writer Luís Cardoso de Noronha (b. 1958), who has lived in Portugal for many years. The consistency of Cardoso's writing, published in Portuguese publishers, is more than confirmed. What is new here is that this eighth novel of his, the announced end of a cycle dedicated to Timor, takes up much of his first book, of which it is, in a certain sense, a rewriting: Crónica de uma travessia (1997), published when its author was a representative of the Maubere resistance. We are in fact left with the feeling of closing a cycle of writing around the national issue. It is Timor, with its imagery, its people, languages, past and hopes, that remains at the forefront of his novels.
Cardoso has accustomed his readers to structured writing, with many layers, dense with references. Strongly autobiographical, it has the courage to include in this novel very difficult events from the author's life, such as the murder of his brother, who disappeared in pogroms between rival political parties, formed after the Portuguese withdrew from the territory. It is then the drive to report, the so-called récit de vie, between memorialization and denunciation, which came from his first book, that internally mobilizes this Hotel Timor, a metaphor for the nation still under (re)construction, from a colonial hotel to a space in ruins until it is once again renovated as a hostel. It is precisely here that the writer and his double are seen hosting, and one of the axes of the novel is precisely this question of the double. In fact, there are several in this story. The Timorese is also someone who continually unfolds: an “original”, pre-colonial in nature, and another who was shaped by the hands of the colonizer: “The faithful and true relationship of a Timorese is with the mate-bian [the dead]. Then God, Homeland and family, in this same order, as it was at the time of the Estado Novo and the Old Empire”. (p. 23) Here the writer’s characteristic irony can be seen.
The main pair of doubles is, however, made up of the first protagonist, who shares many characteristics with the empirical author, but is not him. There are two parallel returns to today's Timor: that of a famous writer who comes to be decorated and another of a modest cruise singer who comes looking for a lost lover. It is the latter who begins speaking in the first person in the novel, and we are told that he is the one who has written the author's novels; this one, which does not exist, or which exists less than the other. In other words, the real is divided between what came into being and what remained potential, and it is through what is in the shadow that writing and other real things come, which implies a particular aesthetic conception. It also involves a game of concealment: one thing is said to hide another; one thing is hidden to bring another to light. Whoever speaks in this novel is, then, pure potentiality, a ghost. It's a life possibility for the empirical writer that never materialized, as far as we know: romantic singer on cruises. Reality (written or not) would be a kind of chiasmus between these two planes. If it is, then, the writer's double who actually writes the novels of the author who accepts being awarded a medal, it is because he is the writer and, simultaneously, an envoy of the ancestors. The author is just a big shot to whom medals can be thrown and hands shaken at ceremonies. The dead and ghosts both belong to the same latent world. Another way of saying that there is no point in giving a medal to the writer, because the person who writes his novels is (his) shadow, the unconscious, the drift — which is another way of putting things for those for whom such things don't make sense.
Now, the world of spirits, of shadows, in short, the remote world of Timorese animist traditions, very present in countless references in Tetum and in the structuring logic of the book itself, is not a picturesque folklore that surrounds it, but a present, active thing. It did not fade during Cardoso's long exile: it informs his books, where the dead come to speak, as Raul Brandão said about his. The dead shape their literature from the other side, and it serves as communication with them. The world of spirits and the world of the living are like two communicating arms of an hourglass, connected by the sand of the voice.
This is, I think, the richest and most dynamic aspect of the book. Another, of no less importance, is the fact that the pages of the novel operate an inflation of memory in a country robbed of its past and memory, not only because it is a recent nation, but also because of the heavy damage caused by colonialism and the invasion by its neighbor. In a land where libraries are scarce, the book aims to build a kind of minimal library of Timor through citations and references, which reproduces the orature of its people. It aims to create memory, a very necessary process. It is, therefore, natural that it is also an accumulation and a review of the novel library composed by the author, abundant in references to all his previous work, and which feed the novelistic game, as when referring to the Pensão Buganvília, “the same one where Catarina, the fundamental character of the book Requiem for a solitary navigator (…) stayed (…). Having not found any inn with that name, he made a reservation at the Hotel Timor” (p. 19). The library also serves to reveal the sources from which Hotel Timor draws and make its readings an explicit aspect of writing.
It is a book constructed based on short speeches, bits of dialogue that serve as a motto for countless digressions, as the narrative itself is meager, just a sketch: doubles return to Timor at the same time and with the same passport, staying in the same hotel. Um deles é um cantor romântico que finalmente volta para tentar encontrar a sua amada; o outro é o escritor famoso. Esta história quase burlesca permite um mínimo de personagens e de cenas que espoletam recordações, falas internas e externas. O diálogo é, assim, modo de lançar um mote para uma deriva informe, ao modo loboantuniano, que enche todo o romance.
It thus seems that there are several narrators, also in the style of the author of As Naus: the writer's double, his brother who was shot, perhaps others, who segregate memories, episodes and fragments relating to their lives, but always in terms of Timor. It is Timor who is behind it all and who connects all the scattered voices, and this is how one realizes that what is constant in this book, without ever affecting the depth of its intertwining of various traditions (Timorese, Portuguese, Lusophone, European) and countless references from literature and music (Kadaré, Piaf, Dylan Thomas, Mia Couto), is the ironic but good-humored criticism of the destinies of a post-colonial Timor ravaged by nepotism.
The writing is not only a criticism of customs, but a small great revenge: for the prizes he almost received, for the other lives he and his family could have lived if the history of his country had not been the ordeal it was. Despite everything, a Timorese can write in Portuguese and win awards for it (this is what happened to the author, who received the Oceanos in 2021), especially considering that Portuguese is not his mother tongue, it is his work. It is, in a way, a deserved revenge for Manufahi, perhaps the only one possible, as it is a battle won on the “spiritual” terrain of the colonizer, his language. We know that the writer is a direct descendant of Liurals who participated in that last bloody uprising against Portugal, and who lost out, which took place in 1912 in the province of Manufahi. But his grandson's spear stuck deep in the shield that the Portuguese have used to defend themselves around the world: the language.
Thus, for this command of language and narrative mastery, Cardoso has already deserved recognition. And let us not be surprised that those who have already published in large publishing groups are now in independent publishers, which are sometimes more welcoming. His Pumpkin Planter had appeared in Abysmo, by João Paulo Cotrim, and is now published by a publisher with an English-speaking name, but which publishes mainly in Portuguese, Poets and Dragons Society. It is good to have a writer of this magnitude in independent publishers, but the book, full of typos (even in Timorese names), deserved to have a review, which clearly did not happen, and is now in its second edition.</description><pubDate>2026-02-04 04:18:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese New Year | Votive papers session at Fundação Rui Cunha</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/ano-novo-chines-sessao-de-papeis-votivos-na-fundacao-rui-cunha/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) today hosts the second session of the “Fai Chun – Votive Paper Offering” initiative, in celebration of the Chinese New Year. Therefore, those interested and curious can stop by the gallery to receive the votive papers, which are messages of good luck in Chinese calligraphy, between 10am and 4pm. The papers are free, being an event co-organized by the Poetry Association of Friends of Jardim da Flora.
The FRC welcomes 41 calligraphy masters and poets who will create happy phrases and verse couplets alluding to the celebrations of the New Lunar Year of the Horse.
Fai Chun is a traditional decoration used during Chinese New Year, which marks the arrival of the spring season. In Portuguese it can be translated as Onda de Primavera. People place Fai Chun on doors to create a happy and festive atmosphere, as the calligraphed phrases mean good luck and prosperity.
Normally, traditional Fai Chun are red in color, with black or gold characters inscribed with a brush, which aim to protect the houses with good wishes for the year ahead. Nowadays, printed versions are more common and produced on a large scale. They can be square or rectangular and hung vertically or horizontally, usually in pairs. They not only exist in China, but also in Korea, Japan and Vietnam.
2026 is the Year of the Fire Horse, which begins on February 17, 2026 (the first day of the Chinese New Year) and lasts until February 5, 2027.

Armazém do Boi has long accustomed us to bringing new visions of the territory with the work of local artists, but also from abroad. The new triptych of exhibitions, to be opened on the 13th of February, will once again reveal to the public new readings about this common and shared space that is Macau.
One of the exhibitions is by artist Liao Yu-An, entitled “The Drifter of Assemblage – Red and Blue, Color Fields and Monsters”. This is the result of a month of experiences in Macau, where the artist “gained awareness of the fragmented and complex nature of the city”.
In Armazém do Boi's note about this exhibition, it is described that Liao Yu-An sees Macau as “a place where scales oscillate between the miniature and the monumental”, and where “multiple facets coexist in dense proximity, resembling a richly layered and intensely flavorful stew”.
In this presentation, “the artist absorbs and reflects on these sensory impressions, translating them into different pictorial expressions”. More specifically, what the public will be able to see are three sets of works that examine “the mechanisms of transformation between visual signs, urban color structures and a subjective perceptual experience”.
Here, painting is nothing more than “a practice of perceptual translation and experiential reconstruction”. "Between montage and transformation, painting stops being just a means of representing reality, becoming a continuous action that generates perception. Colors, images and fragmented experiences intertwine to form a fluid trajectory of visualization, guiding the public on a sensorial journey situated between the city, the body and the imagination", the same note describes.
Another work that will be presented from the 13th is “Residues: Soup without Water” [Dregs: Soup without Water], by Biyi Zhu, curated and academic work by Vivien Chan.
In this exhibition, there are meanings that are taken from a kind of imaginary dictionary, in which waste is seen as “the last drop, grain or molecule spread at the bottom of the pan”.
“Residues: Soup without Water” refers to what remains “after all the soup has been eaten”, looking at the “soft and moist consistency” of the waterless remains of a soup traditionally prepared according to the rules of Cantonese cuisine.
Thus, Biyi Zhu asks: “What are the possibilities of what remains?”, clinging, through art, to “the remains of the past”. This is a return to Macau after a ten-year stay in the Netherlands, and in this exhibition, “Zhu uses the processes and materialities of Cantonese soup to explore ways of traveling in time, between places, relationships and lives”.
"After drinking the soup, the residue becomes proof of what was absorbed by the body, by the atmosphere. Taking what would normally be discarded, Zhu transforms the residue into tangible forms, dissolving and reformulating ideas of memory, kinship, migration and waste", it further reads.
Personal issues
The third exhibition space is composed of “Who Am I With”, by Li Aixiao, curated by Wendy Wong. This is an exhibition with a more personal nature, which begins with the artist’s “self”, when he “enters the lives, languages ​​and objects of others”.
To do this, he uses performance, photography and other artistic interactions “to persistently question with whom and how we establish connections in this place”. "The works unfold between the approaching and distancing of the body and between the occurrence and interruption of exchange, where some connections take root while others remain in the realm of the unfulfilled. As viewers navigate and observe, they perceive the transitory transformation of identity and the emergence or absence of intimacy, witnessing how language, images and objects serve as modes of presence", it is described.
In this way, “these works point to a state of coexistence that remains perpetually unstable, but that occasionally awakens rare and authentic connections at the moment of encounter”. The three exhibitions can be seen free of charge until March 15th.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 02:01:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Cultural heritage of Chongqing and Xinjiang on display</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/patrimonio-cultural-de-chongqing-e-xinjiang-em-exposicao/</link><description>The Cultural Institute (IC), together with a series of entities from China, is preparing to present an exhibition in Macau that will reveal some of the intangible cultural heritage of the Chinese regions of Chongqing and Xinjiang, namely traditional tapestry.
The exhibition, presented at the Tap Seac Gallery from next Wednesday, 11th, is entitled “Splendid Colors: Embroidery Art Exhibition from Chongqing and the Uyghur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang”, which opens at 6:30 pm.
According to a note from the IC, this exhibition presents a “careful selection” of 154 works or sets of artistic embroidery from the cities of Chongqing and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, including Shu embroidery, Wuxi marriage embroidery, Youzhou Miao embroidery and “Xilankapu” brocade (traditional Tujia weaving), as well as the three embroidery techniques of the Uyghur and Kyrgyz ethnic groups. and Kazakh from Xinjiang.
“All of these techniques were inscribed as representative items of intangible cultural heritage at national or municipal level, and all works are created by transmitters of intangible cultural heritage and masters of crafts and art, showing the elegance of Southern embroidery and the vibrant and bold colors of Northern embroidery.”
The IC adds, in the same note, that these embroidery works “not only reveal a remarkable technique and a varied style, but also contain the cultural depth of the ethnicities involved”. Materials, motifs and color schemes are presented that “incorporate the aesthetic sensitivity and creativity transmitted from generation to generation, expressing the aspirations and desire of the people for a better life”.
Art of good embroidery
The opening day, as well as the 12th of February, promises surprises for participants and interested parties, since at 10 am, 11:30 am, 3 pm and 5 pm, several intangible cultural heritage transmitters will be present who will demonstrate embroidery techniques, lasting approximately one hour per session.
Furthermore, in March, namely on the 7th and 8th, thematic workshops take place with the same transmitters of this heritage. One of them is the workshop on the Chongqing Shu embroidery technique, scheduled for March 7th; The next day the workshop on Xinjiang embroidery technique takes place. The two initiatives take place in the Activities Room of the Xian Xinghai Memorial Museum, located on Rua de Francisco Xavier Pereira. Participation in the workshops is free and sessions will be conducted in Mandarin, with a maximum of 16 participants per session. Residents aged 16 or over will be able to register from 10am on February 12th, through the “Activities Registration” section of the Macau Single Account.
The IC describes the art of embroidery as being “one of the most representative traditional crafts of the Chinese ethnic group, containing a deep historical heritage and rich artistic creativity, with multiple practical, aesthetic, etiquette and cultural transmission values”. This exhibition can be visited until March 15th.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 05:58:40</pubDate></item><item><title>MAM | Macau hosts Vieira da Silva exhibition at the end of the year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/mam-macau-recebe-mostra-de-vieira-da-silva-no-final-do-ano/</link><description>The Arpad Szenes Museum – Vieira da Silva, dedicated to the work of Portuguese painter Maria Helena Vieira da Silva and artist Arpad Szenes, is preparing to present in the Macao SAR an exhibition that presents a retrospective of the work of one of the most influential contemporary Portuguese artists, who died in 1992
The Macau Art Museum (MAM) joined forces with the Arpad Szenes-Vieira da Silva Foundation museum, based in Lisbon, to present a retrospective exhibition of the work of Portuguese painter Maria Helena Vieira da Silva, considered one of the great names in contemporary Portuguese art.
This exhibition is part of the activity plan for this year at the Arpad Szenes-Vieira da Silva Museum and was revealed to Lusa by Nuno Faria, its director, when asked about the internationalization plan for the museum space.
The exhibition in Macau will consist of works from the institution's collection, forming part of “a context of growing international interest in the artist”.
“We were challenged by our partners to hold a large exhibition in Macau with works from our collection and other collections, and we are working on this exhibition, which will take place at the end of the year and will coincide with the Arpad Szenes anthology in Lisbon”, said the person in charge.
According to Nuno Faria, the recent exhibitions of Maria Helena Vieira da Silva's work “raised a very visible interest in the retrospective exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, which shed new light” on the Portuguese artist's work.
“This will be Vieira [da Silva]'s first major exhibition in China”, said the director of the museum opened in 1994 in the former Fábrica das Sedas, in Amoreiras, Lisbon, following the creation of the Arpad Szenes-Vieira da Silva Foundation, in 1990, intended to house and publicize the estate of the two painters.
Still with regard to internationalization, it is planned to present at the Embassy of Portugal, in The Hague, in the Netherlands, an exhibition dedicated to the graphic work of Vieira da Silva, bringing together a significant nucleus of the foundation's collection.
Doubles and coincidences
Furthermore, the year 2026 holds exhibitions dedicated to Rui Sanches, João Paulo Feliciano and Lourdes Castro for the Arpad Szenes-Vieira da Silva Museum, with the annual exhibition plan being organized into three cycles.
In Lisbon, the museum will host exhibitions, among other artists, by Teresa Segurado Pavão, Frida Baranek, Vasco Futscher, Carlos Noronha Feio, Mariana Caló and Francisco Queimadela.
Nuno Faria said that the exhibition program will continue to value the work of the founding artists and promote dialogue with contemporary creation, alongside investing in the international circulation of the institution's “rich, broad and diverse” collection.
The first exhibition cycle opens on February 10th and includes the exhibition “Arpad Szenes and Vieira da Silva: nuclei of the collection”, bringing together fundamental works by the two artists, “organized in a diachronic and thematic reading that highlights the evolution and main lines of their productions”. In the same period, “Essays in Immobility and Secret Movement” will be presented, which brings together sculptures by Rui Sanches and Teresa Segurado Pavão, in an unprecedented collaboration between the two artists.
“There are two artists who have this happy coincidence – like Vieira da Silva and Arpad Szenes – of being a couple, Rui Sanches dedicated to sculpture and drawing, and Teresa Pavão to ceramics and textiles”, pointed out Nuno Faria, highlighting that, according to the invited authors, “this unprecedented partnership between four hands will be unrepeatable”.
The museum's second exhibition cycle runs from the 21st of May to the 13th of September and includes a new presentation of the cores of the Arpad Szenes and Vieira da Silva collection, deepening the reading of the work, and an exhibition dedicated to Lourdes Castro (1930-2022), with unpublished initial drawings, works and documentation from the 1950s and 1960s, developed in partnership with MUDAS — Museu de Arte Contemporânea da Wood.
The third cycle will be dedicated almost entirely to an anthological exhibition of the work of Arpad Szenes (1897-1985), based on in-depth research into his pictorial and graphic production, with the aim of presenting new readings of the artist's work and promoting the international circulation of the project.
“This is perhaps the most challenging exhibition we are going to do this year”, said the museum director to Lusa, adding that the entire museum space will be dedicated to Arpad Szenes.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Game | Fewer illegal loans in 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/jogo-menos-emprestimos-ilegais-em-2025/</link><description>Last year, the Judiciary Police initiated a total of 192 investigations related to illegal gambling loans, which represented a drop of 23.8 percent compared to 2024. The numbers were released yesterday during a symposium on last year's statistics.
Despite there being fewer loans, the number of gambling-related investigations opened increased by 62.6 percent, to a total of 2,314. This increase was justified with the crime of illegally exchanging money for gambling. This was a practice that local authorities always understood was not necessary to criminalize. However, in 2024, after criticism from the Interior in which the practice of these money exchanges in Macau was identified as a vulnerability for the country's security, the Macao SAR Government ended up moving forward with criminalization.
In the statements made, Sit Chong Meng, director of the PJ, stated that since the law combating illegal exchanges of money for gambling came into force until December 2025, 567 cases were concluded, which led to the arrest of 867 people. Police seized more than 94 million Hong Kong dollars, with some operations conducted in cooperation with Homeland authorities.
According to the newspaper Ou Mun, the increase in crime also resulted from “statistical improvements”, which were not specified.
Sit also warned that “as law enforcement initiatives intensify, the activities of money exchange gangs have become increasingly secretive and criminal patterns more sophisticated.” However, the person responsible promised that the PJ “will closely and persistently monitor” the criminal networks that use legitimate businesses to hide these illegal exchanges.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:55:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Emperor | Sold gold from the ground for 100 million</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/emperor-vendido-ouro-do-chao-por-100-milhoes/</link><description>The Emperor group, responsible for the hotel with the same name in Macau, agreed to sell several gold bars that were placed on the hotel floor. The announcement was made yesterday to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and the sale of the metal was agreed for 99.7 million Hong Kong dollars, which should represent a net profit of 90.2 million.
Regarding the reasons for selling the gold, the group explains that it is part of a new strategy for operating the hotel, given the end of the operation of the gaming space, which in the past made the Emperor Hotel a satellite casino.
“Following the closure of its gaming operations, the Group has been actively planning other entertainment and amusement facilities to enhance its overall hospitality experience and broaden its revenue base,” it was noted. “The precious metals that were originally part of the hotel’s interior design and equipment are no longer relevant to the hotel’s theme in the future,” it was added.
The company's Board of Directors also explained that the sale is taking place at a time when the value of gold has reached historic figures.
The buyer is the company Heraeus Metals Hong Kong, representing the German group Heraeus, founded in 1660, which is dedicated to activities such as trading precious metals, recycling, healthcare, electronic products and semiconductors.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:53:03</pubDate></item><item><title>MGM China | Profits rose 10.7 percent</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/mgm-china-lucros-aumentaram-107-por-cento/</link><description>The lion dealership announced annual revenue growth that promises an auspicious entry into the Year of the Horse. In 2025, MGM China announced record profits of $1.2 billion
Macau gaming operator MGM China announced record profits of US$1.2 billion in 2025, an annual increase of 10.7 percent.
This is the third consecutive year with a new maximum, after, in 2023, MGM China registered a historic record of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization (EBITDA) of around 921 million dollars and, in 2024, approximately 1.13 million dollars.
These data, according to a statement sent to the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, were published “inadvertently”, as the publication date was scheduled for February 11th. The results, the company wrote, will be released today “after the market closes”
Also according to the document, in the last quarter of last year, MGM China achieved profits of US$332.3 million, an increase of 30.5 percent compared to the same period last year (US$254.7 million). The company ended the year with an annual increase of 10.9 percent in revenue, with earnings of US$4.5 billion in 2025 compared to US$4.02 billion obtained in the previous year.
In quarterly terms, MGM China achieved net revenues of US$1.24 billion in the last three months of the year, which represents an increase of 21.4 percent compared to the same period in 2024 (US$1.02 billion).
Above expected
In reaction to the announced results, cited by the GGR Asia portal, the financial services company Jefferies considered that they were between 3 percent and 5 percent above expectations.
However, yesterday was marked by a suspension of trading in MGM China shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The suspension took place in the morning, after the parent company, MGM Resorts, had “inadvertently” announced the results of MGM China, even before it was communicated to the Hong Kong Bola authorities.
Six gaming concessionaires, MGM, Galaxy, Venetian, Melco, Wynn and SJM, operate in Macau, the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Casinos in the region closed 2024 with revenue of 226.8 billion patacas, 23.9 percent more than in 2023 (183.1 billion patacas).
Macau casino revenues reached 247.4 billion patacas last year, an increase of 9.1 percent compared to the previous year.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:51:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Hengqin New District | Less than 40% of homes sold</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/novo-bairro-hengqin-menos-de-40-das-casas-vendidas/</link><description>Until last January, 1,610 apartments had been sold to residents in the New Neighborhood of Macau in Hengqin, according to data revealed to HM. Between the end of 2024 and last month, 222 units were sold, less than the apartments sold in Macau in November alone
The sale of apartments in the New District of Macau in Hengqin continues to follow a pace well below the local market, even with the crisis that the real estate sector is going through. According to data revealed by Macau Urban Renewal to HM, by January 2026, 1,610 apartments had been sold in the New Neighborhood of Macau to Macao SAR residents, which represents a proportion of 39.5 percent of the total available units.
At the end of May last year, Macau Urban Renovation's annual report revealed that 1,388 apartments had been purchased in the Ilha da Montanha housing complex since they went on sale in November 2023, which represented only 34 percent of the total volume of units (4,070).
All in all, between the end of 2024 and last month, 222 units were sold in the New Macau District in Hengqin, a volume lower than the sales recorded in Macau only last November, when data from the Financial Services Department revealed 238 units sold, despite the crisis affecting the real estate sector in the Macao SAR.
House of talents
The anemic sales record in the housing complex for Macau residents in the Hengqin Deep Cooperation Zone takes on a more serious tone given the lifting of restrictions that the Hengqin authorities have introduced since 2024.
This week, it was announced that Macau residents can purchase two units in the housing complex. However, Hengqin authorities implemented successive measures to boost sales. The criteria have been adjusted, including the removal of the age limit, allowing minors to own property, the restriction on resale within five years of purchase has been removed, as well as the adjustment of the limit on purchasing residential units.
Furthermore, in September 2025, Macau Urban Renewal announced the start of sales of units in Tower 11 of the housing complex, with prices at special discounts for parking spaces, renovation works and the purchase of household appliances.
The public capital company also indicated to HM that 200 apartments were reserved and leased to “entities that meet the criteria” to house non-resident talent. The lease of these fractions in the New Neighborhood of Macau was established in the land use right transfer contract signed on April 21, 2020 for the project. The accommodation for these qualified staff was reserved in towers 17 and 18 of the housing complex.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:49:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Airport | CAM aims for 8.14 million passengers in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/aeroporto-cam-aponta-para-814-milhoes-de-passageiros-em-2026/</link><description>After a year of 2025 in which the airport lost passengers and commercial flights, those responsible for CAM – Sociedade do Aeroporto Internacional de Macau believe that 2026 will be different. According to figures presented during a Lunar New Year lunch, organized yesterday, the company estimates it will receive 8.14 million passengers and 63,000 commercial flight arrivals and departures throughout this year.
The numbers indicated by the company, and cited by the newspaper Ou Mun, represent an annual increase of 8.2 percent in the number of passengers and 8.6 percent in the number of arrivals and departures of commercial flights.
The annual estimate for the number of passengers in 2026 is still below what happened before the pandemic. In 2019, the airport received a total of 9.61 million passengers, the highest figure since it began operating, and in the previous year it had received 8.26 million passengers.
The increase in the number of passengers is expected, despite the chairman of the company's Executive Committee, Simon Chan Weng Hong, having revealed that from October this year until October 2029 the airport will be closed between night and 8am. The closure was justified by the expansion of infrastructure and landfill. Regarding these works, Simon Chan stated that a “minimal impact” on the operation of the airport is expected.
The president of the CAM Executive Committee also revealed that new restaurants will open at the airport in April, offering meals prepared by some of the best-known local brands.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 05:52:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Nipah Virus | Government prepares aviation sector response capacity</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/virus-nipah-governo-prepara-capacidade-de-resposta-do-sector-da-aviacao/</link><description>On Tuesday, the Health Services held a lecture “Knowledge about Nipah virus infection”, aimed at representatives of the Civil Aviation Authority, CAM, Sociedade do Aeroporto Internacional de Macau, S.A.R.L. and airlines.
The Health Services (SS) indicated yesterday that the event aimed to inform and raise awareness of the cases of Nipah virus infection detected in the state of West Bengal, in eastern India, as well as improving the response capacity of the aviation sector.
More than 100 managers and frontline workers listened to explanations about transmission routes, clinical symptoms and important points of personal protection.
Authorities highlighted the importance of the border post as “the first line of defense against the importation of serious infectious diseases”, by airport professionals and airlines to protect the health of residents.
The SS also guaranteed the reinforcement of the assessment and medical examination of individuals with relevant travel history who present symptoms at border posts. To this end, an “effective interdepartmental coordination mechanism was created with the airport, the Civil Aviation Authority and the competent services”.
Furthermore, “according to the global national investigation and the risk assessment of the World Health Organization”, currently, the impact of the Nipah virus for Macau is “relatively low”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Uber | Deputy calls for regulation and questions data processing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/uber-deputado-pede-regulacao-e-questiona-tratamento-de-dados/</link><description>Leong Sun Iok is concerned about the lack of regulation of online taxi services, in response to Uber's re-entry in Macau, and advocates the creation of a specific law to protect the rights of passengers and drivers. The deputy also questions the location of Uber's servers
The use of mobile applications to hail taxis has been a consensus throughout the world for many years, with the exception of Macau. Uber's restart of operations in Macau, announced on Tuesday, immediately prompted reactions to return to the old order, or concerns about opening services.
One of the voices of consternation is MP Leong Sun Iok. The Operários legislator is concerned about the lack of regulation of applications to request taxi services, and of a specific law that guarantees the rights of passengers and drivers. As such, he expects the Government to come forward with legislation soon.
Speaking to the newspaper Ou Mun, the deputy argued that if a passenger cancels a reservation, the taxi driver will not have the strength to compensate for the loss. The same can happen to the customer if the platform has temporary problems that lead to the cancellation of the order.
Although Uber has guaranteed that the fares charged are the same, “according to the official meter”, Leong Sun Iok stated that current legislation prohibits the charging of additional fares, but that there are platforms that charge them anyway.
Looking for trouble
The transport service between Macau and Hong Kong provided by Uber also worries the deputy, who highlighted that the law requires the vehicle to be licensed and the driver to have a taxi driver identification card to avoid infractions. Remember that in this aspect, Uber indicated that the service will be run by a cross-border transport operator, the company Kwoon Chung Bus Holdings.
In the deputy's view, although Uber exclusively uses taxis licensed from Macau, the customer must be alert and confirm the legality of the vehicle, because in the event of a road accident it may not be covered by insurance. In this regard, Leong Sun Iok also called on the Government to combat illegal taxis.
The “uncertain” location of Uber’s data servers represents another fear of Leong Sun Iok, as Macao SAR legislation requires the installation of servers in Macau, a requirement that four online taxi platforms comply with.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 05:49:16</pubDate></item><item><title>ZELENSKY VS ZELENSKY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.

At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke at length and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. It says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no such thing as chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is usually used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in others. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this mistake. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who didn't love anyone./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria stayed with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely outside our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J. Pinto Fernandes emerges at the exact moment when we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but this only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows everyone else and the joy of recognizing that the yardstick of the world is not measured with my short measure and that, on the contrary, it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican for writers from the north, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thought about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché “all different, all equal”, a return to “diplomacy”, given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that “we are unified because we share the same nature” but simply highlights that we “still do not share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that quenches your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and impressive, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unresponsive to reins and containment.
Let men refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because despite the fact that there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish, because of it the tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the pride of the countries will be destroyed.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert».
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that muzzle, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relationships were restricted, or if it merely lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Obviously, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as a hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the position of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, in a different way, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE
(…)
Helahoho! helahoho!
The poor widow's sewing machine who was bayoneted...
She sewed indefinitely in the afternoon…
A mesa onde jogavam os velhos,
Everything mixed, everything mixed with bodies, with blood,
All one river, one wave, one dragging horror.
Helahoho! helahoho!
I unearthed the child's tin train pressed into the middle of the
[road,
And I cried like all the mothers in the world about the horror of life.
My pantheistic feet tripped over the sewing machine
[widow who was killed with a bayonet
And that poor instrument of peace stuck a spear in my heart.
Yes, I was the one to blame for everything, I was the soldier for them all
Who killed, raped, burned and broke,
It was me and my shame and my remorse like a shadow
[misshapen
They travel around the world like Ashavero,
But behind my steps there are footsteps the size of infinity
And a physical fear of being accountable to God makes me close my eyes.
[eyes suddenly.
(…)
I ordered, captain, to shoot the trembling peasants,
I let the daughters of all fathers tied to trees be raped,
Now I saw that it was inside my heart that all this happened,
And everything scalds and suffocates and I can't move without it
[everything be the same.
God have mercy on me, I didn't have it from anyone!
LÀ-BAS, JE NE SAIS OÙ…”
What is clear today, at this disastrous moment in which Cristiano &amp; Companhia failed in their mission in Braga, and in which the self-sabotage of Russia's gas pipelines reminds us that Putin will indeed be willing to do anything to maintain dominance over the areas endorsed,
is that, bomb for bomb, the “bomb” of the Fifth Empire was preferable.

“We had two of the United States' staunchest historical allies, two members of NATO […] effectively, in a way, bowing down to Beijing”, commented the analyst in his daily bulletin Sinocism.
Last week's visit by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the People's Republic of China – the first by a British head of government since 2018 – comes at a time when other Western leaders, such as those from France, Finland and Canada, are also seeking to strengthen ties with Beijing, in a trend towards diversifying alliances in the face of the unpredictability of North American foreign policy.
Although Beijing did not announce any major concessions to the British delegation, Starmer returned to the United Kingdom with a reduction in tariffs on British whiskey from 10 percent to 5 percent and with the promise of new commercial partnerships. A business delegation of around 50 companies, including AstraZeneca, accompanied the head of Government, and an investment of 15 billion dollars in China until 2030 was announced.
The visit was preceded by the approval, by the British authorities, of a project for a new Chinese embassy in London, blocked for several years, as well as the abandonment of a judicial process for espionage involving Chinese citizens.
For Bishop, Beijing's strategy does not aim to replace the United States as these countries' main ally, but rather to “explore the space left by fissures” in traditional relations with Washington. Starmer's visit, like that of the Canadian Prime Minister, is interpreted as a sign of openness to more pragmatic relations with two members of NATO and the “Five Eyes” information alliance.
“China continues to have a huge advantage in critical supply chains, such as rare earths,” recalled Bishop, referring to Chinese control over minerals essential to the industry.
A recent report by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) think tank pointed in a similar direction. The document concluded that Donald Trump's unilateral and transactional foreign policy is causing a global realignment, with several countries considering China a more predictable and, in some cases, more trustworthy actor than the United States.
Influence Maps
According to ECFR, only 16 percent of Europeans today see the US as a reliable ally. Among respondents in 21 countries, only 10 percent believe that the US will have more influence in the world within 10 years, while 36 percent believe in China. The report also highlighted that many citizens, both in Europe and in the so-called Global South, no longer see the world divided between two rival blocs, but rather as a multipolar space, where it is possible to maintain good relations with both powers.
For Bishop, China's objective is not to turn Western allies against Washington, but rather to take advantage of the divisions that have widened. “It’s not about turning them against the United States, but rather about expanding the space for influence and negotiation,” he stated.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 02:09:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Mineral trade | Beijing rejects fragmentation after US initiative</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/comercio-de-minerais-pequim-rejeita-fragmentacao-apos-iniciativa-dos-eua/</link><description>China yesterday rejected the creation of exclusive “small circles” in international trade in critical minerals and advocated an “open, inclusive and universally beneficial” trading environment, in response to US-led initiatives.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference that “maintaining an open, inclusive and universally beneficial international trade environment serves the common interests of all countries”.
Lin further stressed that “all parties have a responsibility to play a constructive role” to safeguard the stability and security of global production and supply chains for critical minerals.
The spokesperson added that China “opposes any country harming the international economic and commercial order through exclusive ‘small circles’ rules”, in an indirect reference to the cooperation mechanisms promoted by Washington with partners and allies to reduce China's dependence in this sector.
The statements come after the United States announced the creation of a commercial alliance for critical minerals and Washington and the European Union agreed on a first joint action plan to coordinate supply policies for these raw materials, considered essential for industries such as semiconductors, advanced batteries and defense.
Beijing reiterated in recent days that its position on the stability of global supply chains “has not changed” and defended the strengthening of communication and dialogue between countries, to the detriment of formulas that “fragment international trade”.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:59:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Report | Direct investment abroad reaches maximum since 2018</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/06/relatorio-investimento-directo-no-exterior-atinge-maximo-desde-2018/</link><description>China invested around US$124 billion abroad in 2025, the highest amount in new agreements since 2018, North American consultancy Rhodium Group said yesterday.
Although it remains far from the historic record of US$287 billion recorded in 2016, the total value was driven by new generation projects in the mining, data center and energy sectors, which together represented around US$100 billion last year.
The report also highlights that actually completed operations amounted to US$73 billion – the highest value since 2019 –, reflecting the usual delay between the announcement and completion of investments, as well as the cancellation of some projects.
According to Rhodium, although China continues to invest heavily in overseas factories, the trend is declining. On the contrary, exports continue to be the main driver of Chinese economic globalization.
“Chinese companies may be localizing part of their production through foreign direct investment, but China’s globalization strategy continues to focus on exports,” says the report, which adds that “domestic production capacity has grown much faster than outside China since the pandemic.”
North Africa was the only region in the world to record an increase in Chinese investment in new manufacturing units during 2025, which could represent “a disappointment” for countries that hoped to revitalize the industry with capital from China.
Main role
Asia remained, in 2025, the main destination for Chinese foreign investment, followed by markets such as Latin America, driven by mining and infrastructure projects. In contrast, the share of investments in North America, Europe and Oceania fell from around 70 percent of the total in 2016 to less than 20 percent.
The decline was particularly pronounced in Central and Eastern Europe, highlights the consultant, who associates the decline with Beijing's reluctance to allow advanced Chinese technologies to be transferred abroad.
The automotive sector represented 13 percent of investment, the lowest share since 2020, due to the slowdown in electric vehicle production chains. In the opposite direction, investments in iron, lithium and gold exploration projects, as well as in fossil and renewable energy, increased.
The report also highlights the growth of digital services, the second largest in the historical series, with emphasis on the “boom” of data centers in Southeast Asia, and the consumer goods sector, driven by the acquisition of historic European brands and retail networks.
Rhodium Group's estimate differs from official data released by Beijing, which points to US$174.4 billion invested abroad in 2025, 7.1 percent more than in the previous year.
The difference, according to the consultant, is due to Chinese companies that maintain revenues in dollars in their branches abroad, avoiding repatriating profits and converting them into assets denominated in renmimbi.</description><pubDate>2026-02-06 01:58:47</pubDate></item><item><title>China | Veteran investigative reporter detained</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/china-detido-veterano-reporter-de-investigacao/</link><description>A veteran Chinese investigative journalist was detained by authorities in Sichuan province, in southwest China, after publishing an article critical of the actions of local leaders, local press reported yesterday.
The police in Jinjiang district, in Chengdu, the provincial capital, reported on Monday, via social media, that two people, identified only by the surnames Liu (50 years old) and Wu (34 years old), were placed under “criminal coercive measures in accordance with the law”, on suspicion of “false accusations” and “illegal commercial operations”.
According to the Chinese newspaper Caixin, the detainees are journalist Liu Hu and his assistant, Wu Lingjiao.
Liu Hu is known for his work as an investigative reporter for the Guangzhou-based newspaper New Express. In recent years, he has maintained a social media account where he publishes independent reports, mainly on conflicts between private companies and local authorities.
Last Thursday, Liu published an article, which has since been deleted, in which he cited a source who accused Pu Fayou, secretary of the Communist Party in Pujiang town (under the jurisdiction of Chengdu), of abuse of power and repression of local businesspeople.
The article also referenced Pu's alleged connection to the forced demolition of two properties owned by university professor Tuo Jiguang, who committed suicide in 2021 after prolonged litigation with authorities.
Quoted by the Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post, an official from the Party committee in Pujiang confirmed that a joint investigation team has been set up between Chengdu and Pujiang, saying that the authorities “are giving high priority” to the allegations made by Liu. However, he declined to provide further details.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 06:08:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Depression Kristin | Timor-Leste approves donation of 4.2 million euros to support Portugal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/depressao-kristin-timor-leste-aprova-donativo-de-42-milhoes-de-euros-de-apoio-a-portugal/</link><description>The Government of Timor-Leste approved yesterday, in the council of ministers, a donation of 4.2 million euros in support to Portugal to face the destruction that occurred following the Kristin depression.
“This financial support aims to contribute to the immediate response and recovery efforts of the most affected areas”, can be read in the statement from the council of ministers.
Ten people have died since last week following bad weather. Civil Protection recorded five deaths directly associated with the passage of the Kristin depression and the Câmara da Marinha Grande announced another fatality, to which were added four deaths recorded due to falls from roofs (during repairs) or poisoning originating from a generator.
The total or partial destruction of homes, businesses and equipment, falling trees and structures, cuts or restrictions on roads and transport services, especially railway lines, the closure of schools and power, water and communications cuts are the main material consequences of the storm, which caused hundreds of injuries and displacement.
Leiria, Coimbra and Santarém are the districts with the most damage.

A total of 15 municipalities were affected, with the amount of snow accumulated in the most affected areas being estimated at two meters high.
In Niigata, a rice-producing region in northern Japan, deaths were reported, including a 50-year-old man who was found lying on the roof of his home in the city of Uonuma on January 21.
In the city of Nagaoka, a 70-year-old man was found lying in front of his home and urgently taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Niigata authorities believe the elderly man fell from the roof while clearing snow.
Seven snow-related deaths were also reported in Akita Prefecture and five in Yamagata Prefecture. The number of injured across the country reached 393, including 126 with serious injuries, 42 of them in Niigata.
Fourteen houses were damaged, three in Niigata and eight in Aomori Prefecture, where up to 4.5 meters of snow accumulated in isolated areas.
A strong cold air mass has brought heavy snowfall in recent weeks along the Sea of ​​Japan coast, with some areas receiving more than double the usual amount of snow.
A Japanese government spokesman warned that although temperatures are rising, new dangers could emerge as snow would begin to melt, resulting in landslides and slippery surfaces.
“Please pay close attention to your safety by wearing a helmet or safety rope, especially when working in snow removal,” Minoru Kihara told reporters.
Elections on the way
The Government of Japan has created several task forces to respond to heavy snowfall in Niigata and nearby regions since January 20.
Snow-related deaths and accidents are not uncommon in Japan, with 68 deaths recorded during the previous six months of winter, according to the Japanese Fire and Disaster Management Agency. More heavy snow is forecast for the weekend, with the country holding early general elections on Sunday.
Japanese public broadcaster NHK said several agencies were working to ensure the elections ran without incident, and authorities urged voters to exercise caution and check weather conditions before traveling to vote, including during the early voting period.
According to the most recent polls, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is on track for a landslide victory in the elections, called by the conservative leader just two weeks ago to take advantage of high approval ratings and reinforce the popular mandate for her new coalition government. This will be the first time since the 1990s that Japan has held early elections.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 06:05:52</pubDate></item><item><title>EU | Beijing denounces “protectionism” after investigation into wind manufacturer Goldwind</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/ue-pequim-denuncia-proteccionismo-apos-investigacao-ao-fabricante-eolico-goldwind/</link><description>China yesterday accused the European Union of protectionism for opening an investigation into wind energy manufacturer Goldwind for alleged state subsidies, warning that these types of measures “undermine the confidence” of Chinese companies in Europe.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian urged Brussels to respect its market opening commitments and the principles of fair competition, calling for an end to the “abuse of unilateral trade instruments”, while defending a “fair, transparent and non-discriminatory” business environment for companies from all countries.
Lin declined to comment on the specific case, referring any clarifications to the Chinese “competent authorities”, but stated that the European Union has repeatedly resorted to “discriminatory and restrictive” measures against Chinese companies, which, according to him, harms the bloc's image and affects the availability of Chinese companies to invest in Europe.
The spokesperson also reiterated that Beijing “will firmly safeguard the legitimate and legal rights and interests of Chinese companies”, in line with the position taken by China in other commercial processes initiated by the EU in sectors considered strategic.
The Chinese reaction comes after the European Commission announced the opening of an investigation into the Chinese wind turbine manufacturer Goldwind, over suspicions that subsidies granted by Beijing – such as direct support, tax benefits or financing under favorable conditions – could distort competition in the EU's internal market.
Goldwind operates in several European countries through subsidiaries, including the German Vensys, developing activities in the EU that range from turbine production to research, maintenance and management services for wind farms.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 06:01:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Xi talks via video conference with Putin</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/05/diplomacia-xi-conversa-por-videoconferencia-com-putin/</link><description>Chinese President Xi Jinping held a videoconference conversation yesterday with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, reported the official Chinese news agency Xinhua, without revealing, for now, the content of the meeting.

The leader of China's main consultative body, Wang Huning, and an opposition representative in Taiwan yesterday highlighted the notion of a “common Chinese nation” between the two sides of the Strait, at a meeting in Beijing.
The leader of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference defended that the inhabitants of both sides of the Taiwan Strait have “common responsibilities towards the Chinese nation”, in the meeting with Hsiao Hsu-tsen, vice-president of the Kuomintang (KMT), in the context of an apparent rapprochement effort between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the main opposition party in Taiwan, which goes against the cycle of growing tension between Beijing and Taipei.
Wang assured that holding the recent think tank forum between the two parties demonstrates “the commitment of both parties to the well-being of citizens on both sides” and contributes “positive energy” to cross-strait relations.
“The inhabitants of both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to the Chinese nation”, share “the same blood, the same culture and the same history” and have “common responsibilities towards the nation and shared aspirations for the future”, he stressed.
Hsiao reinforced that the so-called 1992 Consensus and the opposition to Taiwan's independence “constitute the common political basis that allows exchanges between both parties to be maintained”. The leader went further by reformulating the original understanding of the agreement, stating that “each party expresses a single China”, thus rejecting the idea of ​​“different interpretations” of the concept.
“Chinese consciousness is our soul, Chinese culture is our body and the Chinese nation is our root,” declared Hsiao, in a symbolic gesture of political alignment with Beijing.
One country
The meeting took place in the Xinjiang Hall of the Grand Palace of the People, in Beijing, according to the Taiwanese news agency CNA, one day after the forum that marked the resumption of institutional exchange between the CCP and the KMT, interrupted almost a decade ago. The event is seen as a preliminary step towards a possible meeting between Xi Jinping and the new KMT president, Cheng Li-wun, scheduled for the first half of this year.
The 1992 Consensus is a tacit understanding under which both Beijing and Taipei recognize the existence of ‘one China’, although they disagree on what that means. This ambiguity allowed, for decades, dialogue between the continent and the island.
The harmony between the PCC and the KMT contrasts sharply with the hostile climate between the Chinese Government and the Taiwanese Executive, led since 2016 by the Democratic Progressive Party - a formation that rejects 'reunification' with China and argues that the political future of the island rests exclusively with its 23 million inhabitants.</description><pubDate>2026-02-05 05:59:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Marcelo Loureiro, author and teacher: “The indigenato was a continuation of slavery”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/04/marcelo-loureiro-autor-e-docente-o-indigenato-foi-uma-continuacao-da-escravidao/</link><description>Esteve recentemente em Macau para apresentar o livro “Colonial Citizenship: law, race and rights through the Portuguese empire”.

How did this investigation begin and how did the themes of colonialism and citizenship emerge?
Everything was born from a personal and family experience. I grew up in Rio de Janeiro, in a family marked by the Portuguese diaspora on the one hand, and colonial silence on the other. My paternal grandmother, Portuguese, kept the documents that allowed me, at the age of thirteen, to claim Portuguese citizenship in the back of a closet. My other grandmother, mestizo, cafuza, had no papers, no stories to tell; From her to me, there was only silence. This division, between those who have the right to documents and a voice and those who are forced to be erased, was the starting point for questioning the legal construction of citizenship and nationality. When I arrived in Portugal to study Law in Coimbra, I began to realize that the law that recognized me as Portuguese was the same one that historically denied this recognition to millions of people based on race, 'civilization' and skin color. The book is, in part, an attempt to understand this legal structure of inclusion and exclusion, it is a denunciation of the injustice behind rights. It is a denunciation of citizenship as a method of exclusion.
In the context of the Portuguese empire, when did the first notions of citizenship emerge and what criteria were used?
The first formal notions of national belonging in Portugal appear in the Philippine Ordinances of 1603, which establish who should be considered 'natural' of the kingdom. It is interesting to note that the inclusion of the notion of nationality was only included in Portuguese law during the Iberian Union, during the Philippine dynasty, when Spain controlled Portugal through the Habsburgs. It was in this context that Spanish law was transposed to Portugal to separate Portuguese from Spanish. However, the practical construction of Portuguese citizenship begins much earlier, in opposition: through slavery. Since the 15th century, with papal bulls (such as Dum Diversas of 1452 and Romanus Pontifex of 1454), Portugal obtained canonical legitimacy to enslave Africans and conquer their territories. Portuguese citizenship was thus constructed, in opposition to the figure of the ‘other’ – the Moor, the black, the pagan, the ‘savage’, and finally, the ‘indigenous’.
What were the differentiation criteria?
The criteria were essentially civilizational and racial: being Christian and, progressively, being white or recognized as ‘civilized’ according to European standards. Conversion to Christianity functioned, at times, as a kind of 'spiritual whitening', but even converts rarely achieved full legal equality, which continued to be imposed for centuries. The law called indigenous to all those who existed outside the standard of civilization expected of citizens, which were the non-white populations of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and Timor.
Macau will always have occupied a “privileged position” in the context of this empire. Specifically, how?
In terms of citizenship, Macau has never been subject to the Indigenous Statute, which was in force in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and Timor. This exclusion was not accidental. The Indigenous Statute applied to populations considered 'uncivilized' according to European racial and cultural criteria, being, in practical terms, essentially black populations from continental Africa and Timor. In Macau, the Chinese population, often called ‘Macau Chins’, although not European, were treated differently. There were laws that regulated the rights and customs of the Macanese population, with a complete law coming into force in 1909 and only abolished in 1949, for example. The Portuguese presence in Macau has always been accompanied by several other factors, such as British influence through contact with Hong Kong, the progressive political presence of Beijing, Portuguese political instability and the questioning of the existence of the Portuguese empire itself internationally. This meant that Portugal was unable to impose in Macau a sovereignty as powerful as that imposed in Africa and Timor.
Were there cases of discrimination against the Chinese and Macanese communities before the 20th century?
Discrimination existed, although of a different nature than that imposed in Africa. We can even see in literature, in the works of Senna Fernandes, for example, how the existence of walls, sides and parts of Macau, sometimes even ideological, for different populations, from Chinese villages to Christian cities. The same division occurred in the world of rights, only in an indirect way, and not through the direct imposition of indigeneity and the status of second-class national. Segregation and difference occurred socially, with difficulty accessing certain careers, the lack of invitations to birthdays because they were not ‘white’. This discrimination did not take the systematic legal form of indigeneity, as stated. The Macanese occupied an intermediate position, often functioning as intermediaries between the Portuguese and Chinese. Their ‘Portugueseness’ was recognized in an ambiguous way: they were Portuguese, but of a different type.
We can mention that skin color was decisive in not placing Macau under the Indigenous Statute.
Yes, skin color was absolutely decisive. The Indigenous Statute was applied in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea and Timor, territories with populations that are mostly black or ‘non-white’ in the colonial sense. Portuguese law even created the term 'oceanic race' to identify Timorese during the imposition of indigenato so that they could bring this population racially closer to African populations. Macau, Portuguese India, Cape Verde, and, to a certain extent, São Tomé and Príncipe, were excluded from this classification. The official criteria established 'uses and customs' and 'civilization' as the parameters to identify these people, but in reality these categories only functioned as a substitute for race: they were race, but by another name.  The populations of Portuguese India and Macau, although not European, have always been spared the application of openly racist laws, despite local practices and policies imposing, most often indirectly, restrictions on the full citizenship of these populations, as I have described.
Taking into account the Indigenous Statute, what evolution can you trace in terms of the concept of Portuguese citizenship?
The Indigenous Statute, consolidated in the early 1930s, represented the maximum legal codification of racial exclusion. Indigenato was a legal form of racial segregation that created two categories of being Portuguese, namely being a Portuguese citizen (white and assimilated) and being indigenous Portuguese (the majority black). The indigenous people were legally Portuguese, but they were not citizens; they did not live with access to rights, but to restrictions, they lived, as I call it in the book, in a status of ‘negatory nationality’. Indigenous people could not vote, could not move freely, did not have the right to lawyers, were subject to forced labor, paid special taxes based on race, and could not attend the same schools or hospitals as whites. The evolution of the concept of Portuguese citizenship in this context is paradoxical: formally, everyone was ‘Portuguese’, but materially, citizenship was reserved for those who demonstrated ‘civilization’ through skin color or by proving themselves to be sufficiently assimilated despite being black. Assimilation was the only legal path to leaving indigeneity, but it required proving mastery of the Portuguese language, abandonment of African ‘uses and customs’, stable employment, ‘good moral conduct’, and military service.  Very few could.
What are the most flagrant cases of denial of rights that you can point to?
One of the most flagrant is the system of forced labor, which functioned as a continuation of slavery under another name. Indigenous people were forced to work on plantations, mines and public works, often far from their families, in inhumane conditions. Another case is spatial and social segregation: separate hospitals for whites and indigenous people, segregated neighborhoods, different schools. In Guinea, indigenous people were forced to wear necklaces with metal plates. In Mozambique they were forced to pay radio taxes if they had a device. In Timor they were required to pay taxes if they moved from one local authority to another, or when they divorced according to local customs. The archives also show cases of indigenous people who, despite having moved to Lisbon, still continued to be treated as indigenous people. All thanks to a 1955 law that imposed indigenato status on any indigenous person in any part of the Portuguese empire – which was previously only applied in indigenato colonies. This was the case of the so-called ‘Lisbon Requests’, a group of assimilation applications that I found in the Lisbon Ultramarine Archive, where indigenous people who, having emigrated to the metropolis, tried to obtain recognition as citizens.
The Indigenous Statute would be abolished years later, but the effects seem to have remained.
I absolutely agree. And I say more: indigenato was a continuation of slavery itself, a reflection that is still felt today by so many communities touched by the Portuguese empire. The Statute was abolished in 1961, but decades of legal, educational and economic exclusion are not erased by decree. African populations have been systematically denied access to education, property, mobility and political participation for generations. This explains, to a certain extent, the difference between the different parts of the Portuguese empire, where Brazil, Angola, Macau and India occupy completely different spectrums in relation to levels of protection and access to rights. When the Statute was abolished, a context of restriction and necessity was already consolidated where the black majority survived without formal education and without access to basic rights. The post-colonial effects are equally profound: indigenato taught generations of Africans that their culture, language and way of life were inferior, and that to formally be someone, to be recognized as fully human before the law, they had to become white, they had to resemble, as much as possible, the colonizer. But even this formal assimilation rarely translated into real protection: legal recognition did not guarantee effective access to rights. Assimilation marks not only a historical period, but a way of seeing, feeling and surviving colonial history. This violence left marks that persist in Portuguese-speaking post-colonial societies and that can only be resolved when there is a process of acceptance, truth and reconstruction — something that the Portuguese State has not yet been able to do.</description><pubDate>2026-02-04 03:57:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Exhibition | Eric Fok shows “Dreaming of the Occident” in Taiwan: “In Portugal, I see traces of my city”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/15/exposicao-eric-fok-mostra-dreaming-of-the-occident-em-taiwan-em-portugal-vejo-vestigios-da-minha-cidade/</link><description>The year began with a new project by Eric Fok, who despite living in Portugal did not leave Macau and the East. “Dreaming of the Occident” is on display at the Helios gallery, in Taipei, and can be seen until January 24th.

How is the West represented in this exhibition?
I've always been fascinated by the intersection between Eastern and Western cultures, and I've explored how Macau was a territory shaped by Western missionaries and navigators who brought new sciences and ideas to the East. Regarding a previous exhibition, and during the research process, I realized how rare it was for the Chinese to travel to Europe at the time of the Discoveries. I read with enthusiasm the reports of the few who did so. There are diaries that vividly recreate the dangerous sea voyages and what life was like in ancient European cities. This allowed me to project myself into their stories, bridging the gap between past and present, between East and East. These cultural differences are not just history to me, but have become a rich source of imagination for my new work.
As an artist from Macau, how has the history of the territory, marked by exchange between East and West, shaped your way of thinking about this exhibition?
It all started with mapping Macau for the “Paraíso” series [2014 exhibition], a project that was born out of my curiosity about the city's past in a context of rapid expansion of the tourism and gaming industries. Through this dialogue with local history, I began to truly understand the city. I went from focusing on the small details of urban life to having a macro perspective of the world, highlighting Macau's significant role in global history. This includes its status as a gateway to China during the Discoveries, its contribution to the beginning of globalization, or even being a space for the spread of Catholicism to the East. [We cannot forget] the profound influence of maritime culture. All of these themes constitute an extension of my exploration of the historical and unique experience of Macau.
Can you describe in more detail the creative process for “Dreaming of the Occident”?
In addition to maps of Macau, this exhibition also presents maps of Eurasia and several Asian colonies, where I explore themes such as navigation, trade and empire. My research also extends to experimenting with materials. In addition to using paper and wood, I incorporated unconventional supports, such as ostrich eggs. These objects function as canvases to narrate stories about endemic species and the history of migration, establishing a bridge between a biological and historical side.
Does the exhibition intend to criticize the Western influence in Macau, reflect on it or simply observe it?
In my exploration of these themes I am mainly interested in the cultural dimensions of history. When Europeans first arrived in Asia, they viewed the world from a Eurocentric perspective. The term “Far East” was not just a geographical designation, but a symbol of power and a specific vision of the world. But, on the other hand, the term “Far West” represents an initial global imagination, in the sense of being a space of mutual understanding, albeit incomplete. Today, as we live in an era of a lot of information, where connectivity is instantaneous, we have lost that sense of mystery, and my work seeks to recover a little of what is the fantasy of distance.
Do you expect different readings of the exhibition or a deeper knowledge of what Macau is, in cultural and historical terms?
In the creative process, I privilege personal expression as responses to society and the world in which we live. Although exhibiting in a commercial gallery inevitably brings a market dimension to my work, my focus is always on the integrity of the work. In recent years, my desire for the public to “correctly decode” my art has changed, in the sense that, although I feel deep satisfaction when someone connects with my inner world, I have come to accept this “emptiness” in the narrative of my work. These gaps are meant to be filled by the experiences and emotions of the viewer, or perhaps by time and history itself. In a time of rapid and ephemeral changes, I use the brush to document and preserve. My work consists of sharing the urban experience that invites the public to create an emotional connection with cities, promoting a deep reflection on identity and belonging.
He has lived between Macau and Portugal. How does this influence your work and vision of Macau’s history and culture?
At the moment I respond to this interview I find myself in Vendas Novas, a town in Portugal that is famous for bifana. I am currently exploring whether there is any direct connection between this local specialty and Macau pork chop bread. Centuries ago, the Portuguese sought to build a “home” in Macau, leaving behind Portuguese structures that defined the skyline of my city. Currently, being in Portugal, I see traces of my city everywhere. Being Asian, and being surrounded by different races and languages, I find a certain sense of belonging that can be both alienating and deeply familiar. The enormous geographical distance is shortened by culture and history, which are shared. This exchange of identities and the movement between places constitute deep inspirations for my work.
Searching for an unknown place
On the Helios gallery's internet portal, Eric Fok's new exhibition is described as a search for a Europe that, on the eastern side, was known to exist, but which was far from being known, especially from the middle of the 16th century, when the term “Taixi” appeared as a reference to the “Great West”. The Chinese expression was used by the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci and is one of the focuses of the Macau artist's work in “Dreaming of the Occident”.
According to Helios' presentation, “Taixi” was a term attributed to “an extremely distant land in the West that was, once, a blank space on maps, yet to be explored”. In this way, Eric Fok's imagined maps explore the ideas of an absent and unknown place, also analyzing “the identity of the self, the transport of memories, power and ideology”. Using historical research, the Macau artist “rediscovers ‘Taixi’ from the perspective of the Far East, through writing and cartographic representation”. Eric Fok also investigated “the views of the world that existed in the past, formed by the interconnection between power and belief”, it is described.</description><pubDate>2026-01-15 01:53:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Iranian Ambassador in Lisbon condemned “institutionalization of the improper use of force”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/14/embaixador-do-irao-em-lisboa-condenou-institucionalizacao-do-uso-indevido-da-forca/</link><description>Iran's ambassador in Lisbon, Majid Tafreshi, condemned the “institutionalization of a new policy”, implemented with the instrument of “improper use of force”, alluding to the United States and Israel. In an interview with the Lusa agency, Tafreshi warned that this process will “spread” if countries, especially Western ones, “do not take serious measures” against the United States and Israel, “which have incited public unrest”.
“There are no guarantees that such practices will not be repeated, especially when disturbing discussions are already being heard, such as those regarding the possession of Greenland”, highlighted Tafreshi, remembering the North American actions in Venezuela, and the insinuations against Colombia and Cuba.
The interview took place before the diplomat was called by the Portuguese Government because of the violent repression of demonstrations against the Iranian Government, an announcement made yesterday by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Iranian diplomat recalled having already asked his “academic colleagues” and diplomats to create in Portugal a new forum entitled “Dialogue between Enemies”, in the search for “universal peace and a world free from war and tension”, as well as the creation of new mechanisms – such as an East Asian Union – “could constitute a meaningful initiative”.
“I believe that politics and politicians should follow more closely the will of their own people, who, in reality, do not seem to have major conflicts between themselves – as can be clearly seen in tourism, in football stadiums, in concerts and in hundreds of other human interactions”, argued the Iranian diplomat.
Regarding recent developments in Iran, in which, he said, peaceful demonstrations focused on economic challenges, over time, “some elements present in these concentrations escalated to violent incidents”, including armed actions that, according to reports, “involved individuals with prior training”.
“Regrettably, these events resulted in casualties among security forces, public order forces and ordinary citizens,” said Tafreshi, after the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, condemned and demanded an end to the “repression of protests in Iran, which have resulted in more than 600 deaths since December 28, according to a non-governmental organization.
Iran's ambassador in Lisbon referred to the “millions of Iranian citizens” who participated in public demonstrations on Monday, “reflecting a change in the general picture and expressing support for their Islamic country”, which, as in the past, the news received limited attention from the Western media.
Outside incentives
Asked about what is strangling the Iranian economy, Tafreshi highlights the interventions of Israel, “to a lesser extent”, and the United States, “which have encouraged public unrest”, as well as Iran's economic challenges, which are significantly influenced by extensive sanctions imposed” by Washington.
“These measures, which Iran considers illegal, have also been supported by European countries that defend human rights, despite there being concerns that such policies have negatively affected fundamental rights of the Iranian population, including access to healthcare”, he denounced.
“Respect for the Charter of the United Nations, the bitter lessons of the First and Second World Wars and the devastating experiences and costs of events in Afghanistan, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Ukraine and elsewhere should be enough to remind us of the urgent need to prioritize, more than ever, peaceful coexistence”, he added.
Regarding the high number of fatalities, Tafreshi denied that Iranian security is using a disproportionate use of force, exemplifying, alongside the high number of deaths among civilians, the significant number of deaths and injuries among police officers”.
People power
Asked about the words of Reza Pahlavi – son of the former shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, deposed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution – in which he stated that he intends to return to Iran soon, Tafreshi considered that, with the “support of some Western and Zionist media”, he appears to be trying to play the role of a “Robin of the Woods”.
"However, Robin Hood never called on ordinary people to resort to violence or violate international norms and principles, such as attacking embassies and diplomatic facilities. During his father's reign, despite Iran having the support of the United States and the West, the country lost its 14th province, Bahrain. Based on experience, the United States supports and exploits anyone capable of harming Iran's independence and security," he responded.
Tafreshi denied, on the other hand, that the regime – “the term “regime is an illegitimate and biased expression” – is at risk, highlighting again “the millions” of Iranians who demonstrated on Monday in favor of Iran's sovereignty.
“The Islamic Republic belongs to the people of Iran. Ayatollah [Ali] Khamenei is the leader of Iran and one of those citizens”, highlighted the diplomat, for whom China and Russia maintain “good relations” with Tehran, meaning it is not necessary to count on Beijing or Moscow to defend the country, which counts on its own people to protect its security and sovereignty.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 02:52:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Sofia Ferreira da Silva, author of a study on opera in the Mao years: “Silk Road was the biggest influence”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/07/sofia-ferreira-da-silva-autora-de-um-estudo-sobre-opera-nos-anos-de-mao-rota-da-seda-foi-a-maior-influencia/</link><description>In “Singing the Revolution: The Role of Songs and Opera in the Spread of Communism in Mao Zedong's China”, Sofia Ferreira da Silva analyzes the way in which songs and opera spread political ideals, leaving marks on the country's cultural panorama. The analysis came from the doctoral thesis in Artistic Studies, defended by the author at Universidade Nova de Lisboa
What was the musical environment like in the country before Mao Zedong came to power?
China was, and continues to be, a territory with a huge variety of practices at regional, local and ethnic levels. We can speak of four main types: music of a more erudite nature, symbolized by court music (yayue) and guqin music, more centered on Confucian ideals and with ritual functions and self-cultivation of individual morality; folk music, with vocal and instrumental genres varying according to region and ethnicity; Taoist, Buddhist and other religious music; and traditional opera, such as Kunqu and Peking, Sichuan and Canton operas, combining singing, declamation, stylized movements and martial arts. The biggest influence on Chinese music was, perhaps, the Silk Road, as a good part of the musical instruments that are now considered “Chinese”, such as the erhu, the pipa, the suona and the sanxian, have their origins in foreign instruments brought to Chinese territory, and which were gradually adapted and incorporated into their music. On the other hand, some narrative and operatic genres evolved from the adaptation and combination of counterparts from the territories crossed by this route. If it weren't for the Silk Road, traditional Chinese music would be radically different.
What other influences are there?
The other big influence is Western music. This, despite having entered the country in the 16th and 17th centuries, was felt with greater intensity from the middle of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century. The growing foreign presence and influence led to the systematic introduction of Western notation, academic training along European lines and Western classical and popular music genres, which would be assimilated in varying ways by Chinese composers, such as Ma Sicong, Li Jinhui or Xian Xinghai, combining them or not with traditional music motifs.
In the thesis, he talks about two major changes in the Mao years, with the creation of the so-called “model shows (yangbanxi)” and the revolutionary Peking operas. How did these formats help to reshape the music scene at the time?
The model shows, which include Peking operas and revolutionary songs, played an important role in reforming the Maoist musical landscape, implying changes not only in musical styles, but also in the social function of music. Production became entirely subordinated to the political project of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), resulting in the mandatory membership of artists and designated artistic associations, and the suppression, through criticism in the media, of musical elements or genres considered “feudal”, “bourgeois” or “superstitious”. In opposition, and following successive political movements and campaigns, other formats were promoted, more in line with the regime's ideals.
How, in concrete terms?
In the case of the “yangbanxi”, from the Cultural Revolution, the fact that they were called “model” implied that all new creations must strictly follow the aesthetic precepts established through them, especially the rules of the “basic task”, with the construction of revolutionary heroic figures as the ultimate aim of artistic creation. There were also the “Three Prominences”, with the attribution of greater or lesser prominence to a certain character depending on their degree of positivity or negativity, their function in the plot. These rules guided not only the narrative structure and the role of the characters, but also aspects such as the integration between music and gestures, the construction of costumes and sets, and the harmony between traditional and Western musical elements. This codification would aim, to this extent, to guarantee the ideological and aesthetic uniformity essential to the creation of a controlled, functional and politically effective musical culture within the framework of the objectives of the revolution.
What are the main political messages conveyed through these two types of shows?
The first big idea is the almost religious loyalty to Mao Zedong and the unconditional observance of his ideas. It is his thought that inspires and guides the actions of the heroes and heroic characters, the second most important category of characters in revolutionary operas, and leads them to the successful completion of the mission assigned to them or to heroic sacrifice in favor of the communist cause. The second is the class struggle as the driving force of history. We have, on the one hand, the oppressive, capitalist, imperialist and feudal class as the villain, and on the other the working people, exploited and oppressed by the former, suffering the greatest storms at their hands. The conflicts and difficult situations faced by the heroes or other positive characters, such as the death of family members, imprisonment or slavery, were always the direct expression of this struggle, and their resolution would only come from the revolutionary stance and the assumption of an active role in the construction of socialism.
And the third idea present in the shows?
This is collectivism, as a true revolutionary places the interests of the Party and the People above any individual dream or desire. No matter how prominent his role, the hero needs popular support to complete his mission: his aspirations are the aspirations of the people, and it is in solidarity between all that difficulties are overcome and the much-desired socialist harmony is achieved. Personal achievement only has value if it serves the collective cause, and individual sacrifice is glorified when it contributes to common progress. Operas promote, to this extent, a worldview where individual identity dissolves into the identity of the revolutionary collective, and where the active participation of the masses is not only desirable, but necessary.
These were years of so-called cultural Maoism, as mentioned in the thesis. How is it characterized?
Cultural Maoism presents points of contact regarding the subordination of art to politics, the valorization of the daily lives of the masses as the raw material for creation and the defense of its widespread popularization. However, it is distinguished by its emphasis on the proletarianization of the artist himself, who should abandon his position as a distant intellectual and become an active member of the working people, learning through practice and inserting himself in their daily struggles.
What are the main influences of this movement?
In addition to the Marxist-Leninist matrix, cultural Maoism would be marked by Confucian influences, giving art an ethical and formative function, as in Confucius, Mencius or Xunzi, art shaped character. However, in the Maoist context, this molding was channeled towards the construction of socialist consciousness and the eradication of traces of the bourgeois mentality. One of the central principles of this policy was the “mass line”, a kind of circular cultural dynamic in which popular ideas and expressions were collected and systematized by the Party, before being returned to the people in a clearer and more politically oriented way. Another aspect to consider is the appreciation of native and foreign cultural heritage, condensed in the maxim “use the past to serve the present, use the foreign to serve China”.
In what way?
Para a criação de novos trabalhos artísticos, Mao recomendava o estudo inicial de obras ocidentais, tidas como “científicas” e tecnicamente superiores, antes da incorporação selectiva de elementos da tradição chinesa. In both cases, the value of artistic forms lay in their social and political function, not in their preservation as heritage. Neste contexto, o líder do PCC propôs dois critérios para a avaliação artística: o político, que exigia a promoção da unidade nacional e a rejeição de ideias contrárias ao Partido; e o artístico, que pressupunha rigor técnico e estético seguindo uma noção abstrata de “critérios científicos da arte” ao serviço das massas. This double requirement replaced, in Maoism, the Confucian distinction between moral quality and aesthetic quality.
In these years, what were the biggest influences on songwriting?
The composition of songs was greatly influenced by two great musical traditions: the native, with the use of regional melodies and motifs and those of the various ethnic minorities that make up the territory; and the Western, in which I include the Soviet musical tradition, most visible in marches and so-called “art songs”, which could be understood as a type of revolutionary ‘lieder’ or with highly politicized content. The influence of each of them was more or less visible depending on the political situation of the territory.
How did the years of “cultural Maoism” change the country’s musical landscape?
Some aspects of the production of Cultural Revolution operas, such as the introduction of the Western orchestra and the use of techniques from Western music, the incorporation of more realistic scenarios and the melodramatic nature of the stories influenced and continue to influence the production of new Beijing operas, especially those with contemporary or historical themes relating to the 20th century. XX. Over the last 30 years, operas with historical themes have also been produced with some of these elements, especially in terms of music and settings, such as “Cao Cao and Yang Xiu”. Some remnants of this period can also be seen in the interpretation of traditional operas, especially in the presentation of arias or excerpts on television programs. I see countless performances that combine, just like in the revolutionary repertoire, arrangements with a Western orchestra and realistic scenarios, with extensive use of new technologies. However, what I consider to be the greatest remnant of revolutionary operas will, perhaps, be a greater artistic audacity on the part of the creators of new operas. It is an issue that deserves further study by the academy, but, from my observations as a spectator, I notice a greater openness to the incorporation of elements from other arts, such as dance and theater, and a greater complexity in the characters, especially those considered negative, less antagonistic, with more nuances when it comes to motivations for acting in a certain way. It is obvious that the psychological suffering inflicted by these operas on an entire generation of Chinese people is undeniable and cannot, under any circumstances, be forgotten; however, model operas boosted the creative impetus of composers and librettists, in line with the evolutionary process, of fusion with other arts, of Peking Opera over the centuries.</description><pubDate>2026-01-07 01:10:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist activist, 34 years old, physical engineer, Romani national. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied this right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on permanence, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Municipal Council of Faro wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
What are you talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. O proprietário, o colonizador. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; à exclusão política associada à falta de acesso a informação; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. Como se sente uma criança cigana ao perceber que não faz parte de um todo? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Isso é um desastre para a auto-estima, é uma condenação à priori?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | Rui Valente questions staying in motorsport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/gp-rui-valente-questiona-permanencia-no-automobilismo/</link><description>Rui Valente had a 72nd Macau Grand Prix to forget. To the point that the driver with the most years of activity in motorsport in the territory seriously admits the possibility of hanging up his helmet and putting away his gloves, or, at least, stopping competing in Macau's premier race, be it the Macau Roadsport Challenge or even the entire event.
 
 
“There are a number of factors that lead me to question whether it makes sense to continue,” Rui Valente told HM. The experienced Touring car driver points out several reasons for this reflection, namely “the fact that Grand Prix races are of much less interest today, as they are almost always contested behind the Safety Car, the current scoring system for Macau qualification and the attitude of some drivers on the track”.
The most recent edition of the Grand Prix did not leave good memories for those who made their debut at the Guia Circuit in 1988. The Macau Roadsport Challenge weekend started negatively for the Portuguese driver, who did not avoid touching the rails in the Paiol area during free practice on Thursday, an incident that affected his entire performance. After achieving the 25th best time in the qualifying session, misfortune manifested itself again in the race, when the recovery attempt at the controls of the #16 Subaru BRZ ended prematurely on the approach to the São Francisco Curve. On the restart after the first Safety-Car, Rui Valente was hit by Li Kwok Chuen, in a maneuver in which the Hong Kong driver attempted to overtake on the inside, in a place where there was no available space.
"Even today I can't understand what went through his head. I don't know how he saw a space that simply didn't exist. Maybe he thought I was going to lift my foot to let him pass", recalled the driver, who has thirty-six participations in the Macau Grand Prix and was one of the nine representatives of the Macao SAR in the 2025 edition of the Macau Roadsport Challenge.
 
Qualification lottery
Rui Valente has been one of the most critical voices of the current qualifying model for the Grand Prix, which mainly benefits those who finish one of the races in the top ten. The use of identical vehicles by all competitors, Toyota GR86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8), accentuates the balance of movement on the track. Added to this factor is the fact that only four races count towards qualification and that the grids often have more than three dozen participants, transforming each race into an authentic “pitched battle”, in which the objective is to achieve a top result in a single race to guarantee the points necessary to be on the starting grid for the event in November.
“With so many cars on the track at the same time, there are many drivers under enormous pressure to score points, which ends up causing a high number of incidents”, admits the Portuguese driver. “In this way, the qualification is closer to a lottery than a process truly based on merit”, adds the Premium Racing Team representative.
On the other hand, Rui Valente recognizes that younger people are the main losers. With experience clearly superior to that of newcomers, who have fewer kilometers of track and less competitive experience, the driver emphasizes, even so, that the difficulty is not restricted to newcomers. "Even for those who have been racing for many years, like me, qualifying is extremely complicated. If this is the case for the more experienced, it becomes clear that young people end up being the most penalized by this model", he concluded.
 
Next step
As for the future, Rui Valente – who received the award for third place among Macau drivers in Group A of the MTCS Macau Roadsport Challenge, at the 2025 Awards Ceremony of the General Automobile Association of Macau-China – has not yet made a definitive decision. The alternatives on the table include remaining in competition along the same lines, considering a change of category, an option conditioned by budgetary limitations, or, ultimately, putting an end to their participation in the Grand Prix, or even their career.
The second driver with the most participations in the history of the Macau Grand Prix, just behind Albert Poon, confesses that he has not lost his love for motorsport, an activity that keeps him in excellent physical shape at 64 years old. However, he admits that "perhaps it's time to leave Macau. It's a shame, because I really like this. In fact, the problem is that I like this a lot."</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 01:56:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Coloane | Kartódromo hosts the Champions of the Future Academy Program</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/09/coloane-kartodromo-recebe-o-champions-of-the-future-academy-program/</link><description>The Coloane Kartdrome will start the year at high speed, hosting from the 16th to the 18th of January the first edition in the territory of the new Champions of the Future Academy Program competition, organized and promoted by the Swiss company RGMMC Group
The Champions of the Future Academy Program is an international Arrive and Drive karting competition designed to develop the next generation of motorsport talent. According to the promoter, the event is aligned “with FIA sporting standards and combines elite competition with comprehensive training for drivers, offering young people the experience and international visibility necessary to launch professional careers, while keeping costs under control”.
With three competitive categories — Mini, OK-N Junior and OK-N Senior — the concept aims to bring together emerging talents from around the world to compete in world-class events. According to the organization, this event in Macau “aims to expand the Champions of the Future Academy Program to national series”, reinforcing the presence of the concept outside its main calendar.
In addition to the event in Macao, RGMMC, founded in 2004, also has a non-championship event planned in the United Arab Emirates in February. The regular championship consists of six stages, taking place between February and December, with visits to Spain, Greece, Italy, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The same entity also promotes a series along the same lines in the United Kingdom.
The Champions of the Future Academy Program Macau, which has the support of the General Automobile Association of Macau-China (AAMC) and the MSAR Sports Institute, will take place over three competitive days, with two final races that determine the classification of the event winner for each category. The paddock will open to teams on Thursday, followed by a full day of free practice on Friday, while timed training and racing will take place on Saturday and Sunday.
Equal for everyone
Each category admits a maximum of 24 competitors, a limit that remains the same in all events. The Mini Group 3 category, aimed at drivers between 9 and 12 years old, will use Parolin chassis and TM engines, with a registration cost of approximately 32,750 patacas. The OK-N Junior categories, for ages between 12 and 14, and OK-N Senior, for ages 14 and 17, will compete with Kart Republic chassis and IAME engines, with the registration fee being around MOP42,125 per weekend.
As the name Arrive &amp; Drive indicates, these values ​​include the kart and its engine, space in the tent, necessary tools, tires — supplied in all classes by LeCont Pneumatici —, fuel, lubricants and all associated logistics. This way, drivers can focus exclusively on driving and, thanks to mechanical equality, competitive and lively races can be expected at one of the best kart tracks in Southeast Asia.
In 2026, the Coloane Kartódromo will have a particularly busy calendar. In addition to the karting and motorcycling competitions organized by the AAMC, the route designed by architect Carlos Couto will host the Chinese Karting Championship, on the 11th and 12th of April, the IAME Series Asia, on the weekend of the 23rd and 24th of May, and the Macau International Karting Grand Prix, scheduled for the period between the 11th and 14th of December.</description><pubDate>2026-01-09 02:34:46</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | The driver with the most victories in the history of the race has passed away</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/02/02/gp-faleceu-o-piloto-com-mais-vitorias-da-historia-da-prova/</link><description>British John Macdonald passed away last week, aged 89, after a prolonged illness. He was the most successful driver in the history of the Macau Grand Prix and the only one to triumph on the Guia Circuit in both car and motorcycle races.
The news was released on social media by his friend Eli Solomon, a historian and writer based in Singapore, who in recent years worked, together with Angus Lamont, on the production of the book “King of Macau”. The work portrays the life and career of Macdonald, who lived for decades in Hong Kong and was one of the central figures of motorsport in Southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s.
"It is with deep sadness that I announce the passing of John Macdonald, which occurred on Sunday, January 25th, at the age of 89, after a prolonged illness. His mind remained as clear as ever, and he and Angus Lamont continued to work on King of Macau until the end of last year", wrote Eli Solomon, adding that "the final text was presented to him for approval at the end of last year, with the book expected to be ready for distribution this quarter, possibly in time for the deliveries in the UK for the Goodwood Members’ Meeting in April”.
John Macdonald remains the only competitor to have won all the main races held on the Guia Circuit: four victories in the Macau Grand Prix (1965, 1972, 1973 and 1975), the triumph in the 1969 Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix and victory in the inaugural edition of the Macau Guia Race in 1972. However, his passion for motor sport was not limited to racing in circuit. After starting out on motorcycles in the United Kingdom, he participated in the 1962 Central African Rally, driving a Lancia B20, and in 1963 in the Scottish International Rally, in a Land Rover. That same year he moved to Hong Kong, where he joined the local police. Throughout his career he won three international rallies, two in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines, the country where he became National Champion in 1974.
During his stay in Hong Kong, he was the owner of Camlex Garage, in Kowloon, after leaving Hutchinson, where he held the position of Group Service Director of Far East Motors, at the end of 1967. After retiring from business activity, he sold Camlex Garage, in 1981, to German Motors, owned by businessman and also pilot Herbert Adamczyk.
Eternalized with the wax statue in the Macau Grand Prix Museum, Macdonald was also associated with the famous phrase: “Motor sport is the only truly exciting sport that can be practiced sitting down”.
Sum of successes in Macau
His debut at the Macau Grand Prix took place in 1964, with a sixth place at the wheel of a Lotus Elan, in what was his first experience in speed racing in cars. The following year he returned with a Lotus 18, a formula purchased for 7,000 patacas from the renowned Team Harper, and his performance at the wheel of an already aged single-seater was widely praised. After a race marked by incidents and some confusion, he took the checkered flag in first place and achieved the first of his six victories on the Guia Circuit.
With the introduction of the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix into the program in 1967, Macdonald could not resist taking part, also benefiting from the experience gained in the two-wheeled races he had competed in the United Kingdom at the end of the 1950s. In that debut year, marked by Japanese dominance, he did not stand out, but went on to win the race in 1969.
His second victory at the Macau Grand Prix came in 1972, driving a Brabham BT36 ex-Graham Hill, after an absolutely dominating performance, crossing the finish line with a 30-second advantage over second place. On the same weekend he also won the first edition of the Macau Guia Race, in an Austin Mini Cooper S, a replica of which is now on display at the Macau Grand Prix Museum.
With sponsorship and equipment to match his talent, he returned in 1973 to defend the Macau Grand Prix title, this time in a Brabham BT40, with which he had won in the Philippines and at the Malaysian city circuit of Penang, in addition to achieving third place in Singapore. After taking pole position, he became the first driver to win the race three times, also setting a new lap record.
His fourth and final victory at the Macau Grand Prix came in 1975, nine years before the race adopted Formula 3 regulations, at the wheel of a Ralt RT1. Faced with the strongest opposition yet, Macdonald prevailed again, recording his final triumph in the competition. His last participation in the Macau Grand Prix occurred in 1976. His farewell to Grand Prix racing as a driver took place in May 1977, at the Penang Grand Prix, although in that same year he continued to be linked to Macau as a sponsor, giving his Ralt RT1 to Vern Schuppan. He left Hong Kong in 1983 and moved with his wife to Andorra. His last years of life were spent in Mauritius.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Motorsport | New alternative will be created in Foshan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/26/automobilismo-nova-alternativa-vai-ser-criada-em-foshan/</link><description>Motorsport in the urban core of the Pearl River Delta will have a new permanent infrastructure, after the first fixed circuit was announced in the city of Foshan, located around 120 kilometers from Macau
The official announcement was released in the first week of the year. The result of an investment led by Benchmark Global Group, the project aims to mark a relevant milestone for Guicheng, the urban center of Nanhai district, consolidating Foshan as an international hub for sports consumption and stimulating high-level development in the areas of culture, sport and tourism. Benchmark Global Group had already developed reference projects in Sanshan in partnership with Key Capital, RDM and other entities, including Guangfo Florentia Village, Zona Artística One Times, Hilton Hampton Hotel and Chimei Art School.
According to the statement, “the circuit aims to attract a younger audience and boost the surrounding area”. Inspired by the successful experience of the Tianjin V1 Auto World, whose layout is used in local competitions, the V1 Guangfo International Circuit aims to create an integrated car park, combining the race track, motor culture and themed entertainment. The complex will occupy approximately 141,666.7 m² and will have all the necessary support infrastructure.
According to the tender documents, the land is located on Sanlongwan Avenue, in the south, and Gangzhong Street, to the west, with a lease period of twenty years and planned use as an ecological and sports car park. The project also includes a kart track of at least 1.1 km, while the main circuit should reach FIA Grade 2, allowing it to host competitions promoted by the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC).
The development aims to “strengthen Guicheng's emerging consumption and entertainment ecosystem”, complementing the surrounding commercial hubs and enhancing the urban functions of the Wenhan Lake International Scientific and Technological Innovation Cooperation Zone. Residents and visitors will benefit from more diverse and sophisticated leisure experiences.
Foshan is one of the national pilot cities dedicated to new formats and consumption models, promoting innovation and economic dynamism. The V1 Guangfo International Circuit will represent a concrete example of the application of these guidelines, focusing on diversified consumption scenarios and sustainable growth in the sector.
 
Other options
In the Greater Bay Area, motorsport has focused on the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) and the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC) in Zhaoqing, but several recent projects indicate a growing effort to expand the infrastructure network, including the possible construction of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit in Doumen, with an initial investment of 250 million renminbi and FIA Grade 3 certification.
In 2024, before the return of the Formula 1 Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai, Guangzhou announced plans to build a Grade 1 circuit, capable of hosting events in the premier discipline. So far, no new information has emerged about this project, which was intended to be the second Formula 1 circuit in China. The first, in Shanghai, was opened in 2004, as the Zhuhai International Circuit, the first permanent circuit in China and designed to host Formula 1, never received maximum approval from the FIA. Other projects designed in Hong Kong and Shenzhen have not taken shape until now.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Davis Cup | Tiago Pereira makes his national team debut with China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/09/taca-davis-tiago-pereira-estreia-se-pela-seleccao-com-a-china/</link><description>Tiago Pereira is the new addition to the national tennis team for the Davis Cup match with China, on February 6th and 7th, which also includes Nuno Borges, Francisco Cabral, Jaime Faria and Henrique Rocha, it was announced yesterday. “Tiago Pereira has been improving a lot and, in recent months, he has obtained good results not only in singles but also in doubles, which makes him an option for both variants”, said captain Rui Machado about the debutant.
In addition to the 21-year-old Algarvian, ranked 265th in the world rankings, Rui Machado's bet was on Nuno Borges (45th) and Francisco Cabral (20th), the best Portuguese tennis players today in singles and doubles, respectively, in addition to Henrique Rocha (157th) and Jaime Faria (151st).
Portugal has not competed at home since September 2022, then against Brazil, and the visiting condition has been favorable, but Rui Machado is confident in the group he will take to China.
“We are aware that it will be a very difficult tie against a team with experienced players, with a lot of potential and who have already proven that they can play at a very high level”, he considered, without knowing his counterpart Di Wu's chosen ones. Portugal will visit China in the play-off of Group I of the Davis Cup in tennis, in which they will try to avoid relegation to Group II, where they have not been since 2015.</description><pubDate>2026-01-09 02:28:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Nuno Borges advances to the quarter-finals after beating Marin Cilic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/08/hong-kong-nuno-borges-segue-para-os-quartos-de-final-apos-bater-marin-cilic/</link><description>Portuguese number one Nuno Borges qualified yesterday for the quarter-finals of the Hong Kong Open in tennis after beating Croatian Marin Cilic in two partials.
The first half was more balanced, with the player from Maia, 47th in the ATP rankings, being the first to break the serve of the 37-year-old veteran, number 70 in the world. The winner of the US Open in 2014 still responded in kind, but Borges once again broke the Bosnian veteran's game to win the first partial 7-5.
The Portuguese started the second set better, winning the first three games, an advantage he maintained to close the partial at 6-3 and win the match after just 47 minutes. In the quarter-finals, Borges will face the winner of the match between the tournament's third seed and 16th in the world, the 28-year-old Russian Andrey Rublev, and the 26-year-old Chinese Wu Yibing, number 179 in the world, who came from qualifying.
Borges is the eighth seed in the tournament in the Chinese region, which also serves as preparation for the Australian Open – one of the four Grand Slams, the main tournaments in world tennis – which starts on January 12th.
In the 2025 season, the maiato beat, for the first time in his career, a top 10 player, world number eight, Norwegian Casper Ruud, in the second round of Roland Garros, in May. Borges also reached the fourth round at the Australian Open, in January 2025, and at the United States Open, in August, and was also the first Portuguese to reach the round of 16 of the Masters 1,000 in Shanghai, China, in October.</description><pubDate>2026-01-08 01:19:09</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
