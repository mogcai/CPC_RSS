The PLD-a party leading the government-may have lost the absolute majority in both parliament chambers this year, but opposition seems too fragmented to prevent Takaichi from being elected Prime Minister in the coming days, in October 13, according to local media.
Sanae Takaichi, 64, will succeed Shigeru Ishiba, who was elected head of government in October 2024 and resigned last month. In the second scrutiny, which took place Saturday and in which only the elected representatives and PLD members were voted, Sanae Takaichi surpassed agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, 44.
Takaichi will have to ensure that the PLD -a right -wing nationalist party in power almost uninterrupted since 1955, but now increasingly rejected by voters -recovers part of his ancient glory. "With all you, we opened a new era for the PLD," said the new leader to his peers a few minutes after his election.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:37:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | Revenue rises 6% in September despite super typhoon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/jogo-receitas-sobem-6-em-setembro-apesar-de-super-tufao/</link><description>Macao casinos revenues rose in September 6 percent compared to the same period of 2024, despite the temporary closure due to Super Typhoon Ragasa. Still, last month was the second weaker this year
 
The game sector raised 18.3 billion of Patacas last month, another 6 percent from September last year. The registration represented the second lowest monthly amount of 2025, revealed the Macao Game Inspection and Game Coordination Directorate.
Still, revenues have increased in annual terms, despite the passage of Ragasa, which led the authorities of the Chinese semi -autonomous region to end the casinos for 33 hours. Operators will have lost 880 million patacas in revenues, almost 5 percent from September, estimated Jeffrey Kiang, analyst at CLSA consultant, quoted by the Ggraia news portal.
The amount recorded in September represents 82.8 percent of the same month of 2019, when Macao casinos had revenues of 22.1 billion patacas.
Compared to the previous month, territory casinos loved 17.5 percent gross revenues. However, it should be noted that in August this year, the Macao game industry recorded the best monthly performance of this January 2020, with gross revenues around 22.16 billion.
Widen
In terms of accumulated gross revenue, the first nine months of 2025 recorded an increase of 7.1 percent over the same period last year, reaching 181.3 billion patacas. Macao closed 2024 with total revenues of 226.8 billion patacas, more 23.9 percent than the previous year.
The Macao government predicted, in the initial budget for 2025, that the year would close with total revenues of 240 billion patacas, which would represent a 6 percent increase compared to last year. But on June 11, the Legislative Assembly approved a new budget, proposed by the executive, which reduces the forecast for public revenues by 4.56 billion.
Secretary for Economics and Finance, Anton Tai Kin IP, admitted to the deputies that the cut is due to the fact that the game's gross gross revenues in the first trimester of 2025 "was" slightly below planned.

A bright gold clock and a gold ring with a large undead jade stone immediately attract the look to the left hand. The right hand is equally adorned, with a gold dragon ring wrapped in the index finger and a gigantic ruby ​​giggle to the ring finger. A wooden beads surrounds the right wrist, adding the finishing touch to the whole. Alexander Leong's legacy began in 1940, when the family owned eight holders in Hong Kong.
At that time, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the pledge houses lived a boom, fed by refugees who fled to Hong Kong and Macau in serious difficulties. “People pledged shoes, comforters and clothes in my grandfather's time,” Leong told Lusa.
After 70 years in the stronghold of players, the store moved to a neighborhood inhabited by migrant workers. The change has led the Leong business to have as main customers workers from Southeast Asia countries, which meant "significantly lower profits."
“A player customer is equivalent to 30 or 50 local or migrant workers,” he estimated, stressing that these workers often pledged jewelry for liquidity after sending most salaries to home countries. Still, Alexander Leong does not regret change. "Good thing we moved. If we had not done it, it would have been terrible," said the businessman, who is also president of the Fiscal Council of the Macao Stress Traders Association.
The power of the game
The Leong family witnessed the entire cycle of expansion and contraction of the Macao pledge industry, a sector intrinsically linked to the casino business.
Shortly after the liberalization of the game in 2003, Alexander says, the number of pledge houses in Macao “increased dramatically” when compared to the period even before the transfer of sovereignty from the territory to China in December 1999. “Macau had not been over 40 or 50 establishments,” he said.
“In the moments of peak of activity, around 2014, there were more than 200 pledge houses,” he said. This number fell, however, significantly, today is only 56, a number that has not been seen since the period prior to 1999, and the descent has not yet stained, given the new challenges that are announced.
The decline began in 2019. "The massive protests in Hong Kong impacted our industry in Macao. The [Chinese] tourists of the continent were afraid to come to Hong Kong and, as Macau is neighboring, they didn't travel here either," explained the attachment.
"Then, when the pandemic arrived, the business fell to the pike," he continued. After the end of borders, many pledge businesses, which previously operated 24 hours a day, had only daytime. "This forced the closing of numerous houses," he added.
The most recent challenge now arises, with the end of the satellite casinos by the end of the year, and the crisis in the sector “will deepen even more,” says Alexander Leong.
He feels that the sector has been "marginalized by the authorities, who consider the seils a" high risk "business for money laundering." However, he argues, although the Macao game industry is considered nuclear, "the pledge houses have served a mutually beneficial purpose, themselves and the rulers for centuries."
The pledge houses are a vital part of the ecosystem, said the associative leader, as a message: “not only generate tax revenue for the government and value the city that never sleeps, but also provide additional employment opportunities to Macao residents.”</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:42:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinema | “The memory of the smell of things” distinguished in Morocco</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/cinema-a-memoria-do-cheiro-das-coisas-distinguido-em-marrocos/</link><description>The film “The Memory of the Smell of Things”, by director António Ferreira, was distinguished with the honorable mention for 'best argument' at the Tanger Film Festival, in the northwest of Morocco, the producer announced yesterday.

The argument was written by the director himself and co-argumentista Tiago Cravidão, said the producer in a statement.
"This is a movie about empathy, about learning to see each other, through dialogue, not as a threat, but as someone like us, has desires and aspirations similar to ours, however different we appear to be," said António Ferreira, during the awards ceremony.
The Tangier Film Festival took place from October 1st to 4th. “The Memory of the Smell of Things” debuts in Portuguese theaters on November 6th. The film had already won, in June, the best actor of the Shanghai International Film Festival in East of China, for José Martins.

A subcommittee of the Public Security Police (CPSP) is being investigated for the crime of abuse of power. At question is that the agent has used his powers to cross the border, often accompanied by the family, by the workers' internal channels, in order to avoid complications of normal channels for residents and tourists.
The information was released on Friday by the Commissioner Against Corruption (CCAC), who points out that the subcommittee is "suspected of abusing his power, several times" to "enter his family in Macao through the migration post that was under his command."
In addition to using with the family the internal channels for employees, the CCAC indicates that the subcommittee also required "its subordinates to deal with the formalities of passage at the borders, in order to circumvent normal procedures of customs control at the border post."
The situation of illegal tickets lasted about four years, between 2020 and 2024, with the subcommittee to "take advantage of his police identification card to access the interdict's interdict employees, where formalities concerned the border passage." "In addition, when entry into the sons, it avoided passing through the customs inspection zone, ignoring the customs inspection formalities, the measures of migration control and the order of the border passage of the masters," was revealed.
Case in the Public Prosecution Service
"This subcommittee is suspected of the crime of abuse of power foreseen and punished by the Penal Code, and the case was sent to the Public Prosecution Service and communicated to CPSP," was disclosed. The crime of abuse of power is provided for in Article 347 of the Penal Code and provides for a three -year prison sentence, which may also be a fine. It is a crime that implies showing that the agent has benefited from conduct or causing damage.
With the press release on which it revealed the case, the CCAC called on agents to be strict and have no expectations of being able to violate the law without being caught. "The CCAC reiterates that civil service workers, particularly agents of authority, should be more strict in their self-discipline and should not challenge the law, hoping not to be caught," he was reported.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:18:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Metro | New Passenger Record in September</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/metro-novo-recorde-de-passageiros-em-setembro/</link><description>Last month, a daily average of 30,600 passengers was registered to use the light meter of Macao. It is the highest amount since tickets started to be paid. Compared to September last year, the number of passengers more than doubled
Macau's light meter registered an average of about 30,600 passengers per day in September, the highest number since the transportation began to charge tariffs, the operator said on Friday. According to official data, the Macao Metro Society of Metro, the average passenger increased by 10.9 percent compared to August, and more that doubled compared to the same month of 2024.
The light meter was inaugurated on December 10, 2019 and this month continues to stop the record, with a daily average of 33,000 passengers. At that time, trips were free as a way to start the start of operations of this means of transport.
In February 2020, with the start of tariff collection and the detection of the first cases of infection by the new coronavirus in Macao, the daily average passenger fell to 1,100. The light meter would record this minimum amount in July 2022, the month when the city was in confinement for two weeks due to an outbreak of COVID-19.
Mountain connection
In December, the length of the slight surface meter that connects Macau is operated to the neighboring mountain island, with 2.2 kilometers.
A month earlier, the line that goes to Seac Pai Van was inaugurated, a neighborhood of Colaane where the government built 60,000 public housing apartments. The light meter ripped with only one line, which was circulating only on Taipa Island, with a length of 9.3 kilometers and 11 stations, with a frequency of 10 to 15 minutes for almost 17 hours per day.
The connection from the subway to Barra, in the south of the Macao Peninsula, through the lower floor of the SAI Van Bridge, began operating in December 2023.
With the extent of the light meter, the authorities predict that the passenger volume reaches 137,000 people a day in 2030. The government launched at the end of 2022 the contests for the design and construction of the eastern east line, which will connect north of the Macao Peninsula, where the main border with mainland China is located.
On Wednesday, Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam Vai Man, said the government is planning the extension of the light meter with the construction of the West Line, which will pass through the inner port.
This neighborhood is regularly affected by floods. On this aspect, Raymond Tam stressed that "it is necessary to consider and proceed with a planning and study of a number of factors that integrate flood prevention infrastructures, peripheral streets, planning and landscaping." The light meter has suffered significant financial skids as well as in the execution deadlines. The first line, promised for over a decade, cost 10.2 billion patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:16:28</pubDate></item><item><title>MATMO | Fourth typhoon in five weeks caused a wound</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/matmo-quarto-tufao-em-cinco-semanas-causou-um-ferido/</link><description>Typon signal 8 was aveiled for about 11 hours, between 2am and 1pm yesterday. In addition to a wounded, the fall of a bamboo scaffold from the Dª Building. Juliet Nobre de Carvalho led several roads to be closed
Typhoon Matmo rose over 300 kilometers from Macao, but caused a wounded and the fall of a scaffold at Toi San forced some public roads to be closed. These were two of the nine occurrences recorded by the Civil Protection Operations Center (COPC) during that which was the fourth typhoon to affect the territory in five weeks and which led to signal 8 of typhoons to be raised for about 11 hours, between 02h and 13h.
The details about the injuries caused to a citizen were not revealed, but the occurrence was declared to COPC for health services and the Kiang Wu Hospital, where the person was treated.
Typhoon's passage was also marked by the fall of a bamboo scaffold on the Dª building facade. Juliet noble of Carvalho. The occurrence caused the viaduct in front of this building to be temporarily ended.
As a consequence, a section of a Nova de Toi San Street was also temporarily closed, the connection of the intersection between Artur Tamagnini Barbosa Avenue and Conselheiro Borja Avenue, until the intersection between Artur Tamagnini Barbosa Avenue and Pow Chon Street. Among the closed roads was also the section of the intersection between Artur Tamagnini Barbosa Avenue and Central Street of Toi San until the intersection between the isthmus of Ferreira do Amaral and Central Street of Toi San.
The fall of the scaffold was included in official data on occurrences during the typhoon, with the authorities to record a total of three cases of scaffolding or objects in fallen shipyards, or that threatened to fall, to public roads.
However, the largest number of occurrences were related to the removal of plaster, complaints, windows, awnings or other objects at risk of falling, with seven occurrences. There were also three cases of removal of buildings, lamps or trees at risk of falling or overthrowing.
The passage of the maturity also led to nine people to resort to the emergency reception centers provided by the Institute of Social Action (IAS).
Never seen
The latest typhoon to affect the territory was equally marked by a debut. For the first time since the Macau Bridge was inaugurated, he remained open to traffic, although the number 8 sign of typhoon was lifted.
The announcement that the central bridge board would remain open with signal 8 of typhoon was released on Friday through the official bulletin. The speed of the crossing in case of typhoon is limited to 60 kilometers per hours.
With this infrastructure open to traffic, drivers have another alternative to circulate between Macao and the mud in case of typhoon. In addition to the Macao bridge, it is equally possible to circulate on the bottom tray of the SAI van bridge. Regarding transportation, the Macao Civil Aviation Authority (AACM) revealed that 51 flights were affected by Typhoon, with 18 to be canceled, 26 to delays and seven to change at times.
Explanations and records
With signal number 8 of typhoon to be replaced, the authorities issued a statement to justify that the distance is not the only reason for the highest signs.
"In general terms, the more intense winds are in the vicinity of the center of a tropical storm. Thus, the closer to the center, the more likely to register strong winds (equivalent to a signal 8) or even more intense," he was explained. "However, in fact, the intensity of the wind generated by a tropical storm is influenced by several factors, including the structure of circulation, the interaction between weather systems and the differences in the wind direction," he was added.
On the maturity, it was indicated that the “wide extent of the strong winds was sufficient to affect the region” and that the “intense gusts associated with rain bands resulted in winds that, during signal 8, continued to reach or exceed level 8 in open areas and bridges”. "Thus, the distance cannot be the only criterion to be considered to determine the need to issue typhoon signs," he was stressed.
The SMG also reported that this was the 12th tropical storm affecting Macau this year, a record that only parallel in 1974. These storms made signal 8 for the fourth time in the same year, which had only happened in 1993, 2008 and 2022.
Denial floods
Yesterday, Full Images circulated on social networks in the Patane area. However, the authorities issued a statement to indicate that the images were raised during Typhoon Ragasa, who passed Macau last month. “Regarding an online video that alleges serious flooding in the Patane zone, CPSP confirmed at the site that there are no floods right now. This video was filmed during the passage of the tropical storm Ragasa, which recently hit Macau.
The COPC calls on the public to avoid creating and spreading rumors, as such acts can be a crime, ”was appealed.“ The COPC is continuously monitoring the city's situation and clarifies that small floods have been checked in the interior port area, which have already retreated, ”was added.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:14:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Traders warn of consequences of the satellite casinos closure</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/comerciantes-alertam-para-consequencias-do-fecho-de-casinos-satelite/</link><description>Entrepreneurs told Lusa that the closure of satellite casinos threatens the survival of economic sectors that depend on them, such as the pledge houses and the luxury trade.
The streets of Zape and Nape zones, once excited by players, are being deserted. "The pledge houses in these areas will simply close or change. I don't see another solution," Macao General Association of Penhoers, Alexander Wai Kai Leung told Lusa.
It is expected that at least nine of the city's 11 satellite casinos cease operations by December 31, a period of a period of grace period of three years granted to agreements between the operators of the game spaces and the dealers under which they operated.
Among the satellite casinos located in the areas of Zape and NAPE are the Casa Real, Fortune, Kam Pek, Landmark, Legend Palace and Waldo. Lusa tried to contact the hotels that houses these spaces, but none of its employees could indicate what the future of the place will be after closing. Grand Emperor serves as an example: the casino has closed three years ago and the facilities remain empty to this day.
"If casinos close, the impact on us is significant. Our livelihood depends on players," Leung said, also expressing the hope that the satellite casinos will remain open.
Letter of intent
The Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) told Lusa that it “intends to attract visitors” to the Zape area to support local commerce. Measurements for the doing include events, improvement of the urban landscape and the offer of special packages directed to concert spectators, which include 'vouchers' of purchases and museum tickets.
Entrepreneurs like Leong remain, nevertheless, skeptical. The president of the Penhores Houses Association questions these measures, considering them even useless for the pledge houses.
"Our industry depends on players as their main customers. They can attract people to dinner on the street, but I don't see how it benefits us," he said, adding that he feels that the sector has been "marginalized by the authorities, who consider the" high risk "business for capital bleaching." According to the association, there are about 25 pledge houses in the area of ​​Zape and Nape.
The threat extends beyond the pledge houses. Stool shop windows like the In Vo Chong group display shark fins, whiskey premium and Moutai, captivating a wealthy clientele.
Owner, Lok Chi Lai, Deputy Secretary General of the Hong Kong and Macau Swallow Nests Association, recognizes government efforts to increase the influx of people other than gaming space regulars. However, he told Lusa, these initiatives “cannot attract high range customers to consume”, only attract “young people to take photographs”, clarifying that there are more than 40 establishments of this kind in both areas of the city.
"Those who come to play are willing to buy luxury goods at higher prices to offer. Without these customers, the future doesn't look so laughing," Lok said. On the other hand, he added, promoting hotel offer located at Zape and Nape is also ineffective because "the hotels here are old (…), and high -end customers prefer to stay in five -star hotels in Cotai."</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:12:56</pubDate></item><item><title>AMCM | Macao and Cape Verde regulators reinforce cooperation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/amcm-reguladores-de-macau-e-cabo-verde-reforcam-cooperacao/</link><description>The new agreement was signed on Thursday and announced the next day.

The pledge houses are a vital part of the ecosystem, said the associative leader, as a message: “not only generate tax revenue for the government and value the city that never sleeps, but also provide additional employment opportunities to Macao residents.”</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:42:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinema | “The memory of the smell of things” distinguished in Morocco</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/cinema-a-memoria-do-cheiro-das-coisas-distinguido-em-marrocos/</link><description>The film “The Memory of the Smell of Things”, by director António Ferreira, was distinguished with the honorable mention for 'best argument' at the Tanger Film Festival, in the northwest of Morocco, the producer announced yesterday.
Persona Non Grata Pictures stressed that the feature film was recognized by the festival's official jury "for the originality and subtlety with which the argument addresses aging questions." The argument was written by the director himself and co-argumentista Tiago Cravidão, said the producer in a statement.
"This is a movie about empathy, about learning to see each other, through dialogue, not as a threat, but as someone like us, has desires and aspirations similar to ours, however different we appear to be," said António Ferreira, during the awards ceremony.

The stage is the large auditorium of the Macao Cultural Center (CCM), with the beginning of the show scheduled for 7:30 pm.
The production is in charge of Opéra Comic and the Zurich Opera, with staging of Andreas Homoki. This show takes place in partnership with the Macau Orchestra, and the collaborations of the China National Symphony Orchestra and Macao Youth Choir.
“Let's dive into a world of burning passion.” This is the reputed left in the official show of the show, marked by a "dramatic involvement and unforgettable music".
On the CCM stage is “an inventive production”, with “pulsating arias and inspired by Spanish musical exoticism and timeless themes”. With this adaptation of the “Bizet masterpiece”, “Carmen” remains “today as powerful and relevant as when it was created”.
“Taken to the scene by reward Andreas Homoki, the production transports the plot to an austere and metal scenario. An replica of the Opera Como Page becomes the background of a time trip, where each act suggests a different era: from Paris da Belle Époque to World War II and, finally, to the present”, describes the program.
"Carmen" thus captures "like never the crude and dramatic emotion of the classic, reinterpreting themes that emerge the destiny and humanity of a subtle and at the same time bold."
According to the program, this show can be enjoyed by "melómanos or novice spectators", because "this production involves and challenges us, remaining with us much after the show is over." We are thus before "an extraordinary demonstration of music, tragedy and seduction."</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 02:22:54</pubDate></item><item><title>North Korea claims to have mobilized “special means” against South Korea</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/coreia-do-norte-afirma-ter-mobilizado-meios-especiais-contra-coreia-do-sul/</link><description>North Korea mobilized “special means” against South Korea, where approximately 28,500 US soldiers are highlighted, said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, quoted yesterday by the state press.
According to North Korea's official news agency, KCNA, the revelation took place on Saturday, in a speech given a gun exhibition in Pyongyang, but Kim did not disclose details about the "special means." "The nuclear alliance between the United States and South Korea is quickly progressing, and are conducting various types of exercises to test hazardous scenarios," said the North Korean leader.
"As US military personnel reinforce their arsenal in the South Korea region, our strategic concerns about this region also intensify and therefore allocated our special key resources," Kim said. The North Korean leader assured that he was “closely accompanied” the military developments across the border.
"The enemy (…) will have to worry about changes in his security environment," he said. Photos released by KCNA show Kim to walk in front of weapons, including a missile, surrounded by North Korean generals in an exhibition center.
Promises to fulfill
On September 22, the North Korean leader declared himself willing to resume dialogue with the United States if they fail to demand that Pyongyang abandon the nuclear weapons program. "If the United States abandon its delirious obsession with denuclearization and, recognizing reality, truly wish to coexist peacefully with us, then there is no reason that we cannot sit at the table with them," Kim said.
"I have good memories of the current US President Donald Trump," he added. North Korea performed six nuclear tests between 2006 and 2017 and has since continued to develop its arsenal despite heavy international sanctions. Pyongyang justifies its military nuclear program with the threats that it claims to be targeted by the United States and its allies, including South Korea.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:35:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Zhuhai | About 70 families of Macao affected by center closing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/zhuhai-cerca-de-70-familias-de-macau-afectadas-por-encerramento-de-centro/</link><description>A Zhuhai Basketball Academy closed, leaving about 70 families from Macao to ask for the reimbursement for the payment of registrations. The case was presented at a press conference marked by the Alliance of the People's Alliance of Macao Institution.
During the event, a group of parents affected by the closing, which were without the money paid, exposed the situation. According to those affected, the Basketball Academy had been operating for about six years, so it was considered by families as a credible institution. The closing was thus a shock to everyone. About 70 families will have paid more than 400,000 Renminbis, which gives an average of 5,714 Renminbis for family.
The closing took place on September 24, but parents criticized the attitude of the institution, because since June 18 that had ongoing a promotion with cheaper registrations, in the case of the first children's registration or simply renewal. According to the contours presented, three days from the close of the gym were still being accepted registration.
With families complaining about the closure, the Zhuhai authorities organized a meeting between their parents and those responsible for the gym. However, the meeting promoted by the authorities on the other side of the border was inconsequential, in the protection of the rights of Macao residents. Of the meeting, did not result any agreement or solution.
Parents also criticized the gym, because despite working six years ago they had no license from the Interior Education Department, as would be expected. Macao's 70 families are part of the 2,000 families affected by Zhuhai's latest scandal.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:20:29</pubDate></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Zhang Xuan (713-755), the painter of the Tang, was the author of a painting that can today be admired through a copy attributed to the Emperor of the Song, Huizong (R.1022-63), where beautiful richly dressed, combed and adorned tasks are observed, which is usually expected to be performed by the servants of these ladies.

A bright gold clock and a gold ring with a large undead jade stone immediately attract the look to the left hand. The right hand is equally adorned, with a gold dragon ring wrapped in the index finger and a gigantic ruby ​​giggle to the ring finger. A wooden beads surrounds the right wrist, adding the finishing touch to the whole. Alexander Leong's legacy began in 1940, when the family owned eight holders in Hong Kong.
At that time, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the pledge houses lived a boom, fed by refugees who fled to Hong Kong and Macau in serious difficulties. “People pledged shoes, comforters and clothes in my grandfather's time,” Leong told Lusa.
After 70 years in the stronghold of players, the store moved to a neighborhood inhabited by migrant workers. The change has led the Leong business to have as main customers workers from Southeast Asia countries, which meant "significantly lower profits."
“A player customer is equivalent to 30 or 50 local or migrant workers,” he estimated, stressing that these workers often pledged jewelry for liquidity after sending most salaries to home countries. Still, Alexander Leong does not regret change. "Good thing we moved. If we had not done it, it would have been terrible," said the businessman, who is also president of the Fiscal Council of the Macao Stress Traders Association.
The power of the game
The Leong family witnessed the entire cycle of expansion and contraction of the Macao pledge industry, a sector intrinsically linked to the casino business.
Shortly after the liberalization of the game in 2003, Alexander says, the number of pledge houses in Macao “increased dramatically” when compared to the period even before the transfer of sovereignty from the territory to China in December 1999. “Macau had not been over 40 or 50 establishments,” he said.
“In the moments of peak of activity, around 2014, there were more than 200 pledge houses,” he said. This number fell, however, significantly, today is only 56, a number that has not been seen since the period prior to 1999, and the descent has not yet stained, given the new challenges that are announced.
The decline began in 2019. "The massive protests in Hong Kong impacted our industry in Macao. The [Chinese] tourists of the continent were afraid to come to Hong Kong and, as Macau is neighboring, they didn't travel here either," explained the attachment.
"Then, when the pandemic arrived, the business fell to the pike," he continued. After the end of borders, many pledge businesses, which previously operated 24 hours a day, had only daytime. "This forced the closing of numerous houses," he added.
The most recent challenge now arises, with the end of the satellite casinos by the end of the year, and the crisis in the sector “will deepen even more,” says Alexander Leong.
He feels that the sector has been "marginalized by the authorities, who consider the seils a" high risk "business for money laundering." However, he argues, although the Macao game industry is considered nuclear, "the pledge houses have served a mutually beneficial purpose, themselves and the rulers for centuries."

In their philosophies about death, Portuguese and Chinese differ in the fundamentals, especially when the Taoist cultural matrix comes into play, but they agree in some aspects, when the Confucian Philosophy dominates. For the latter, as well as for the Portuguese, death causes mourning, sadness, suffering and pain. Confucius in the Analects advised a three -year mourning to all those to whom the parents died and death was a subject of extreme consequences and severity, while for the so -called passing was and is no more than a natural transformation, in a process in which life and death complement each other and interpenetrate in such a way that one cannot be perspective without the other, so funerals should not be space of pain and pain, no way not to interfere with the process of transmuting the being in question.
The Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi (莊子, 369-286) reports in the third of the seven inner chapters of the homonymous work, one of the various episodes of death, relative to the school's patriarch funeral, Lazi (老子), where the way the disciples are lived to the disciples to sentimental manifestations:
They violated the nature of things as they abandoned themselves to sentimentality, in ancient times it was considered 'a crime of violation of nature'. The return of your master to the earth is timely and his natural departure. A timely return and a natural match has nothing to do with joy or sadness. This was considered emancipation of division by the ancients.
Resins and wood can be consumed, but fire will continue. No one knows when the fire ends.
(是遁天倍情 ， 忘其所受 ， 古者谓之遁天之刑。适来 ， 夫子时也；适去 ， 夫子顺也。安时而处顺 哀乐不能人也 哀乐不能人也 ， 古者谓是帝之悬解。
指穷于为薪 ， 火传也 ， 不知其尽也。2
(ZHUANGZI, 1999, 46-47)
Death is nothing more in Taoist philosophy than the return movement to the great way, the Tao (道 道), as well explained in Chapter 40 of the Laozi Road and Virtue, or the “return” hexagra of the classic of mutations (易經), the classic founding of all others, or what some synologists called it, the philosophical “Bible” of the Chinese.  This hexagram of the "return" (復 fù), also called the "turning point" by Richard Wilhelm, is composed of the following trigarms, at the base the thunder (震 zhèn), initiator, and the top the earth (坤 kūn), affirming in the judgment of the hexagra that comes and go is the movement of the tao, it expands or returns, as its nature And therefore, there is always this possibility of starting any turning point sometimes to life sometimes to death. This hexagram is also associated with the image of a radius or thunder over the earth and the winter solstice, a natural period of major changes, in which the sun begins to grow on the horizon of the days. And will there be a greater change than that of life to death and from this to a new life, if to Taoism we add Buddhist hells and reincarnation in the various dimensions of being?
Read the judgment of the hexagram of the “return” (Wilhelm, 1989, 97):
Return. Success.
Go out and enter without error
Friends come what there is nothing to censor.
Forward and backwards it is the way.
On the seventh day it returns.
It's always good to have where to go.
(復 ， 亨 ， 出入无疾 ， 朋來无咎 ， 反復其道 七日來復 ， ，) 3 （張, 1995,109）
As a result, it is found that in Chinese native philosophies as ancient as Taoism and the most remote, such as the one that comes exposed in the classic of mutations, there is no split between immanence and transcendence, life and death, there is a fluid process that runs endless, tireless and unenforceable, so death does not appear as a true problem.
But such a position of the most scholarly philosophy did not always coincide with popular philosophy, based on real myths and stories of seeking immortality, because although it was not supposed to be a true split between life and death, which are seen as the two complementary faces of a transformational process, the truth is that philosophers practiced exercises that, in the first and last analysis, had to lead them to longevity to the immortality. and the rulers followed the aforementioned example by trying to get rid of the natural process. The search for the pills of immortality was frequent not only in the deities as the Divine Archer Houyi (后羿 hòu yì) and his consort chang´e （嫦娥 tehang'é）, but also in more human figures.  The first Chinese emperor (秦始皇 Qín Shǐhuáng), the great uniform of Chinese territory, besides creating a legalistic bureaucratic system and facing Confucian wisdom and literate with the burning of school books, persecuted the worship of physical immortality through the search for elixires who had to live eternally. The tradition that has rushed death with the intake of highly toxic mercury -based elixions. And the pursuit of immortality, or at least the maximum longevity possible, remains a tradition within a popular philosophy that now defines itself as essentially secular, as reported by Reuters when in early September 2025 Russian presidents Vladimir Putin, North Korean Kim Jong Un were "caught" by a microphone that was inadvertently open to discuss issues of longevity. and immortality with Chinese President Xi Jinping (习近平 Xí Jìnpíng). The peaches of the immortality of the paradise of the West Queen of the West (西王母娘娘 xīwángmǔ Niángnáng) and, above all, the elixires manufactured by the Moon Rabbit (玉兔 Yùtù) compete today with other more scientific experiences, which include the possibility of organ transplantation for the creation of cyborg beings that may live 150 years, or more.
Thus, also the Chinese, from ancient to contemporaries, and scholarly philosophies aside, believe as popularly as possible that “heaven can wait,” so the longer they live here on Earth, the better.
With regard to the Portuguese, it will be unleashed that they sign underneath, and with more emphasis this position of Chinese popular philosophy. These are the faithful heirs of a strong Christian tradition, even when they say non -religious. They are in their cultural DNA a radical dichotomy between divine good and satanic evil, earthly immanence, full of errors and omissions, and the transcendence full of blessing. Therefore they cannot escape the images, however metaphorical they consider them, from heaven, hell, purgatory, etc. After all, even the most “intellectually evolved” consider that “the devil lurks”, “walks out” and, of course, is on the bad side of the world, the one in which the darkness in which the angels of the apocalypse will be sent all who have incorrectly proceeded in this existence. There will be a final judgment to which they will only escape the good and the righteous, those who have a pure heart like children or those who are “free from the law of death” through their “valuable works”, in the manner of the Camonian song.
But it is understood: good works do not get rid of physical death, only spiritual, only honor and fame will remain to all who have left their high mark in this world, as well suggested the saying of the best popular philosophy "death with honor, disassess." Now it will be interesting to see the Chinese correspondence, which is provided by Monsignor António André ngan in sino-Portuguese agreement of idioms and idioms (1998, 216) 視死如歸 (Shì Sǐ Rú Guī), which means in a literal translation for Chinese, “seeing death as a return”, but the truth is that this return has a very different meaning in China, where it is seen as something Body, physically turns to life, while the “disassombre” for the Portuguese means leaving the world of spiritual darkness to return to life, but in spirit, the only possible form for a liberation of the law of death.
Death and life form a pair of non -complementary opposites in the Portuguese. It means that death, "that does not expect," this one that "is always certain although the time is uncertain" does not depend on normal circumstances of Himself, but on God, for "only who God wants," according to the Christian tradition. Only God and Jesus have the possibility of rescuing death. They are on the side of life and eternal life, while death belongs to the kingdom of darkness and Satan. In the Book of Proverbs, 8, 35-36 is clearly affirmed regarding wisdom, "Whoever finds me finds life and enjoys the favor of Yahweh. Who loses me, arranges himself, for all who hate me love death."
Note that the vast majority of miracles performed by Jesus and the saints of the Catholic Church are miraculous healing and the resurrection of the dead, and can be described as times when the supernatural order intervenes in the natural order to free it from illness and death, and these extraordinary actions do not succeed everyone, but only to those who are fair and good, as well as their will, in which the demons were expelled.
For the Portuguese there is then to choose sides, through a wise stance, that is, acting correctly to be on the side of life so that when the end of time comes, as is predicted in the book of Revelation, each is judged according to their conduct (Rev. 20, 13-14) and so that the end of the history announced in this text of the apostle John can be transformed into life: “ Text ends with the promise of a new sky and land.
The big difference between Chinese and Portuguese philosophies about death is that the Chinese by tradition is allowed greater flexibility, life and death go hand in hand, they are part of the same process, so if death is certain, life is also guaranteed at the outset. They have the conceptual gadgets necessary to face the passing more at will and naturalness. Although many times throughout the history of this people, there has been a coexistence of postures, on the one hand, death is better accepted and, on certain schools, of taoistorist, even advises to face it with Gúudio, but on the other, one seeks to extend to the limit of the possible eyes not in a spiritual immortality to the Portuguese, but physical and concrete, either in the present via the present via the various experiences. scientific that the contemporary world favors.
Already the Portuguese, although also very closely trust in science and doctors, see and as parentheses the legitimate struggle for better health services, and have a language centered on "health", being the proverbial "how has passed?" The best of the examples of this, only very recently have been awakening to the exercises and practices of longevity, so in this respect the Chinese have greater advantages regarding healthy postures and the “manufacturing of elixires”; The compatriots never lose sight of the certainty that "death does not expect" and that "who has to die," even though those who have true faith believe in the possibility conditioned on the good works of an eternal life in a new world.
The Chinese will succeed the same with regard to good works, which will allow them according to Buddhist philosophy to reach Nirvana, or in their most popular aspects, reach a Buddha paradise, or, alternatively, return to Tao, diluting in an eternal present.

Emperor Wanli (1572-1620), named Zhu Yijun, had an underground palace built to be his tomb, whose value spent would allow feeding ten million people for a year. The decay was prevailed and the population lived in misery. He was forced to pay high incomes and fees, which led the peasants to revolt and take up arms to protect themselves.
In 1627 a peasant revolt began north of Shaanxi, which extended to Shanxi and Henan. In 1635, heads of armed groups of peasants met in Xingyang, Henan province, to plan a strategy. Li Zicheng, one of the leaders, with his army of peasants occupied Xian in 1644, and the entire province of Shaanxi, having formed the state of Dashun. Then he left east and passing by Shanxi and Hebei, began to Beijing, which led the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Chongzhen (1628-44), who was also called Zhu Yijun, taking refuge on Mount Wansui (Hill of Long Life), located in the northern part of the Imperial Palace. Then it was 43 days, but all efforts failed and without a solution to the complicated situation, the emperor hanged himself. China was out of imperial government for a few months, a period known for the interregnum Shun.
Ming troops fought the rioters peasants in many parts of China and a small ming cut moved to Nanjing, now with the name of Yingtian, creating the South Ming Dynasty.
The Manchus had their ancestors on the Nuzhen tribe, which in the Song had formed the Jin dynasty and lived in the Northeast many centuries from the mountains of Altai. In 1616, they joined the command of Nurhachi and in 1636, his son Huangtaiji formed the state of Qing. With an increasingly strong military body, he was preparing to invade China. For a long time, the Manchus troops were being parked along the borders with the territory of the Ming Dynasty.
General Ming, Wu Sangui, who ruled the passage of Shanhaiguan, surrendered to the Manchus and let them go through the great wall so that the Ming troops, together with the Manchus, to fight the rebels. Li Zicheng had to leave Beijing and, heading west, to Shanxi, was chased by the Manchus and Ming troops that had united. He was killed in Hubei, at the age of 39.
After the Manchus troops crossed the great wall with the help of Wu Sangui, they found China without a dynasty on the dragon throne a few months ago. In 1644, the Manchus occupied Beijing and stopped their capital, which until then was in Shenyang. Many Ming officers, who hitherto cooperated with the Manchus against the peasants, changed to their side, fighting the invaders Manchus.
With the last Emperor of the Ming Dynasty killed in 1644, the small Ming Court settled in Nanjing and then formed the South Ming Dynasty (1644-1662). Zhu Yousong, prince of Fu, becomes Emperor Hong Guang (1644-1645) and freed from the prison Zhu Yujian, convicted since 1636, when he was withdrawn the title of Prince of Tang.
Yingtian (Nanjing) was captured in June 1645 by the Qing forces and the ming court fled again. Divided into the South Ming Dynasty, part goes to Shaoxing (Zheijiang) and another refugee in Fuzhou, where Emperor Long Wu (1645 -1646) climbs, whose name was also Zhu Yujian, Prince of Tang. He belonged to the eighth descendant generation of the third son of the first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty and had the hope of being able to defeat the Manchus, who already formed the Qing Dynasty.

With the antecedents explained, we come to the period of the story that interests us to study to recognize the character linked to the Ming who hides behind the god Zhu of Xian, whose belief of his protection has great power.
Until 1660 there was a resistance from the Chinese Han to the Manchus, where Macau has placed himself, sending several times military detachments, with cannons, to help the Ming Dynasty, which had opened the doors of the middle country.
In 1630, paid by the Ming Court, they departed from Macao four hundred Portuguese towards the Great Wall, but when they were in Jiangxi they were interrupted in their march due to the intrigue of Canton merchants with the provincial mandarins.
In 1643, a cannon and four top scorers are sent from Macau to Guangzhou and Nanjing, which between 1644 and 1645, receives the court that runs away after the Manchu invasion.
Following the conquest of Beijing by Manchus, the loyal forces to the Ming Dynasty again ask for help from the Portuguese and therefore, in 1646, Nicolau Ferreira joins the last southern Ming Emperor, Yang Li. He reigned for a period of fifteen years, being captured in early 1662, when the second Emperor Qing, Kang XI, had been in power for a year.
Macau remained faithful to Ming and good relationships with resistance forces, led since 1644 by Zheng Chenggong. Whether this name tells us little or nothing, the Coxinga is more recognized by those who use history, although both represent the same person.
Coxinga's name was given to Zheng Chenggong by the Dutch, who heard him in Taiwan from the mouth of the inhabitants of Fujian, where the mini dialect and the Kejia of the Hakka people, who called him Kok Sèng Iâ. Coxinga, whose birth name was Zheng Sen and then passed to Zheng Fu Song and only in 1645 moved to Zheng Chenggong, was the son of a former inhabitant of Macao, with the Christian name of Nicholas Gaspar. Coxinga's father, Zheng Zhilong (1604-61), born in Fujian, had spent some time as a young man in Macau, where he was converted and baptized. After recognizing the good money in trade, Nicholas Gaspar again as Zhilong, joined a group of pirates, who attacked mainly Dutch, headquartered in Taiwan and Chinese merchants, still making trade with Japan. And it is in Japanese Mother, who was born Zheng Fu Song's Zheng Sen (1624-83). The father, Zheng Zhilong in 1628 he was dedicated to the attack of Chinese Qing ships, fighting for Ming. Already his son, who had spent his first seven years of life in Japan, then will pick him up to be with him living in Fujian. At 15, Zheng Fu Song studied in Nanjing Guo Zhi Jian and in 1645, at the age of 21, studied at Beijing Guo Zhi Jian.
Zheng Zhilong was the most powerful ally of Emperor Long Wu (1645-1646) with whom he had a great friendship, since he had helped him to arrive at the emperor. By the faithfulness of both Zheng Zhilong and the son, the emperor, in Fuzhou, in 1645, attributes his family name, Zhu, Zheng Fu Song, which thus has the official name of Zhu Chenggong. Despite this name means “Zhu Success” in 1646, with the Qing Army victories in the center of China and Fujian, Emperor Long Wu on October 6 was captured and executed.
The Manchus bought Zheng Zhilong to be at their service and it accepts. His son, angry by the parent having passed to the Manchus hosts, refuses to abandon the Ming and with others from his father's group, ruled Fujian's back since 1646.
Emperor Longwu's younger brother, Zhu Yuyue, escaping by a boat from Fuzhou arrives in Guangzhou where he founded a Ming state, having on December 11, 1646 with the title of Shao Wu reign. But after a month, Li Chengdong, a former commander of the South Ming Dynasty, who led a small group of Qing troops, captured and killed Shao Wu. Little by little, the Qing dynasty occupies the entire Chinese territory.
The siege by the Manchus Guangzhou (Canton), which lasted ten months and ended on November 25, 1650, caused 70,000 dead. It was a great axed to Ming resistance that, in the eastern part of China, was confined only to the sea. Then, the armed commander, Zheng Chenggong, is defeated in 1659 at the Yangtzé River estuary. After this battle, Coxinga returns to Fujian and from there in front of 25,000 people to Taiwan, where after a nine -month siege take the island to the Dutch in April 1661. So many inhabitants of Fujian went to live in Taiwan.
In 1662, Zheng Chenggong died of illness at 38, but Taiwan only moves to the Qing dominance in 1683, when he is conquered to his grandson.
Coxinga behind Zhu da Xian
The history of this period, briefly presented here, transports us to Coxinga, a name given by the Dutch from what they heard from the Fujian Chinese call the Kok Sèng Iâ.
Analyzing the name Coxinga, which in Mandarin is Guo Xing Ye and in Cantonense, Kok Sèng Iâ, we have for Guo (国) the meaning of country, to Xing (姓) the family name and for Ye (爷), respectful way of calling an elder, an officer, the father or grandfather, the parents or grandparents, linked to the representation of power. This means that Kok Xing represents the nickname of the Emperor of China that was Zhu, in the Ming Dynasty.
In 1645, Emperor Long Wu gives Zheng Fu Song the name of Zhu and therefore had the official name of Zhu Chenggong, who wanted to mean "successful Ming Dynasty." It was only used in official documents and only the emperor could call him that, because Zhu was the nickname of those who ruled in the Ming Dynasty. Normally called by Zheng Guoxing and with greater respect Guo Xing Ye, the Zhu reference was hidden from this great character to the Ming Dynasty, especially when it was the Manchu Dynasty Qing that ruled.
The god Zhu of Xian, which means great immortal Zhu, is also connected with Fujian and both linked to the nickname Zhu, the family name of the ming emperors. Therefore, there seemed to be something to unite them, but because it could not be revealed, due to the Manchu dominion then the enemy of the Han, had to hide Coxinga on the cover of a god to worship him.
Still in the South Ming Dynasty, Emperor Yong Li (24/12/1646-20/1/1647) gave Zheng Chenggong the title of Yan Ping Wang.
Attempts to rehabilitate Ming Dynasty, the Manchus consolidated in power in China, when Zheng Guoxing's descendants wrote to the second Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Kangxi (1661-1722), asking Zhu Chenggong, who was in Taiwan, for the province of Fujian.
Emperor Kangxi wrote to them that, although Zhu Chenggong does not belong to his supporters, he allowed his body to come to Nan An in Fujian, his father's homeland Zheng Zhilong (1604-1661).
Since Zhu Chenggong was against the reigning Qing Dynasty, only narrated in the book Fujian Tong Zhi in 1737 in the period of the reign of Qianlong.
Lastly, our hypothesis of Zhu from Xian being Zhu Chenggong seems to be understood in 1875. Emperor Guangxu of the Qing dynasty, from the title of King Yan Ping awarded to Zhu Chenggong by the Ming Dynasty, passed him to God, Yan Ping Jun Wang. But since it did not belong to the supporters of this dynasty, it was called Zhu da Xian, thus hiding the name of Guo Xing Ye, which had great power. In the same year, the emperor offered the renewal of the Kai Shan Wang Temple, which now has the god Yan Ping Jun Wang.
Thus we believe, with these little explanations, to be able to put this God, Zhu of Xian, Deity to Cushion.  We found in Macau the statue of Zhu da Xian in the Temple of Pau Kong, in Rua da Figueira.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Ragasa | Sam hu fai appeals to prevention so that Macau is not delivered to luck  </title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/23/ragasa-sam-hou-fai-apela-a-prevencao-para-que-macau-nao-fique-entregue-a-sorte/</link><description>The government gathered yesterday to discuss civil protection operations due to Super Typhoon Ragasa. Sam Hou Fai appealed to prevention and Tai Kin IP indicated that casinos will close this afternoon, when the sign 8. CNN was advanced yesterday that, so far, Ragasa is the strongest storm worldwide worldwide
 
After playing on land yesterday on the island of Calyan in the Philippines, Super Typhoon Ragasa advanced through the Southern Sea of ​​China, following a trajectory that Macao authorities estimate to be able to pass on 100 kilometers from the territory. CNN indicated yesterday that so far this was the worst storm this year globally.
Here, the arrival of Super Typhoon led the authorities to gather yesterday at the Civil Protection Operations Center with the Chief Executive. Sam Hoi Fai highlighted the importance of preventive work, noting that, based on the analysis of China's interior authorities, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Ragasa may be the strongest storm to reach the Mangkhut, a possibility that has classified as "very tall".
According to forecasts of the meteorological and geophysical services, Ragasa could pass less than 100 kilometers from Macao between dawn and Wednesday morning.  Sam Hou Fai understands that society and all government services have to be alert and should not just “have a mindset to count on good luck”. "It is very said that" Macao is a blessed land, "but this can result in negligence," he added.
The chief executive explained that Ragasa can cause “Storm appear” phenomena as happened with Mangkhut, giving rise to floods with a maximum of five meters high, at the first floor of the red market, for example.
"The impact may be significant. Preparation has been performed in advance and interdepartal communication, hoping that the losses can be reduced to a minimum possible, in order to ensure the safety and stability of the entire population. I am serious to which all traders, public and private institutions, and associations, do the work of preparation against catastrophe in advance," he warned.
Casinos can close
On the sidelines of the same meeting, the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP, said the casinos will close the doors if the storm signal 8, and that the authorities will transmit this scenario in advance to ensure the personal security of tourists and tourism sector staff.  Wong Sio Chak, Secretary for Security, said his tutelage met with companies and associations to coordinate streets cleaning efforts after Typhoon's passage. The secretary also appealed to evacuation, first of all, residents with older age.
In turn, the head of the Department of Family and Community Services of the Institute of Social Action, Law Lai Peng, pointed out that the body has prepared the launch of level 2 of the emergency evacuation and reception mechanism, and the 17 available emergency reception centers could be open, capable of receiving 24,000 people.
Regarding the Macau Bridge, Raymond Tam, secretary for transport and public works, ensured that the infrastructure will be ended in traffic during the typhoon, although the previous results of tests to storm height have been positive.  The secretary justified the closing of the bridge saying that Ragasa is a “super typhoon” and that took into account the poor condition of infrastructure access.
Raymond Tam also mentioned that if floods are above one meter, it will consider the possibility of suspending the supply of electricity in the lower areas of the territory in order to accelerate the entire recovery process after the typhoon.
From 15h this afternoon and until tomorrow, between 250 and 280 flights to or departure from Macau International Airport will be canceled.  As for the return to class, the secretary for social and culture affairs, LAM, ensured that the government will analyze the situation based on official data on floods and heavy rains occurred after the typhoon, provided by weather and geophysical services.
The state of schools and roads will also be analyzed to decide that there are conditions for reopening. However, LAM indicated that schools have flexibility to address issues such as students' presence and testing.</description><pubDate>2025-09-23 03:12:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinema | Hong Kong Movies Shown for the second time in Lisbon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/11/cinema-filmes-de-hong-kong-exibidos-pela-segunda-vez-em-lisboa/</link><description>Former resident of Macau Vanessa Pimentel is the artistic director of the second edition of the Hong Kong Film Festival, which will take place from 25 to 28 September at the Ideal Cinema in Lisbon. "Making Waves - Navigators of Hong Kong" will present films like "Papa", the documentary "Four Trails" and the restored copy of "Ah Ying", 1983
 
There are six films, four fiction and two documentaries, which promise to show the best of the best in Hong Kong cinema. This is the second edition of the Hong Kong Film Festival, taking place in Lisbon, at the ideal cinema, between 25 and 28 September, which has as artistic director Vanessa Pimentel, also she director, former resident of Macau linked to producer Blue Lotus Lisboa.
In addition to the exhibitions, the Portuguese public will be able to closely see Hong Kong actors, directors and producers, in a proof that it is possible to establish ties between Portugal and different cinematic environments. This year's poster consists of “Papa”, a 2024 film by director Philip Yung that will be screened on the 25th, a Thursday. Follows Ray Yueng's “All Shall Be Well”; Rikki Choy's “Never Too Late”; Montages of A Chan Oliver Siu Kuen; Four Trails, a 2023 documentary directed by Robin Lee. To end the beauty festival, the restored copy of Allen Fong's “Ah Ying” will be projected from “Ah Ying”, a 1983 movie.
Vanessa Pimentel explained to HM that the show has “a program that comes from Hong Kong”, where it has been around since 2022. “It is an itinerant program that aims to promote Hong Kong cinema, especially the cinema by younger directs, although programs always contain more veteran performance works,” he said.
This year, besides Lisbon, the Hong Kong Film Festival will pass through cities such as Berlin, Paris, Montreal and Udine, Italy. The event may be linked to Asian movie festivals or not. And it's the intention of Vanessa and Blue Lotus to create an Asian Film Festival in Lisbon, and Macau cinema will be part of it.
"In our case, the show is not associated with any festival because it does not yet exist, but I hope to be able to do so," he said. “I was born and raised in Lisbon, but I come from Macau, and my life from Macau is very close to all this. Of course an Asian Film Festival in Lisbon has to include Macau, nor could it be otherwise.”
“We do this program with a view to going a little further, and we are putting on an eye on the creation of an Asian Film Festival,” he said. "We haven't done it yet, we have to continue to work, but I think we're on the way."
Vanessa Pimentel says that, although she no longer lives in the territory, she is still very linked to the cinema that is done here. “I'm going to Macau at least twice a year, and I've been in permanent contact with movie people. They are all aware of our program [at the Hong Kong movie show] and there is a relationship.”
Film
We ask the artistic director of the show to talk about what the public can see in the small room of the ideal cinema, which works independently, without connection with large film screenings, which is located in the heart of Bairro Alto.
"Papa", which opens the festival, is described "as a very strong and good movie that talks about mental health and has an amazing approach." Vanessa Pimentel describes that this movie was awarded in Hong Kong with the distinction of best actor, presenting themselves throughout the plot "a very particular narrative."
“All Shall Be Well” is again shown in Lisbon, after the presentation at the Queer International Film Festival, and has passed Berlin. “It's a very good movie, there was no more screening after being in Berlin, I thought it would be interesting to put it on the program.”
Vanessa Pimentel also highlights the presentation of the restored copy of "Ah Ying", which belongs "to the new place of Hong Kong cinema", which shows a story that wanders incessantly between "fiction and documentary." It is a "very interesting movie in which the story is inspired by the story of the actress's own [Hui So Ying] who plays him."
The second Hong Kong cinema show will be attended by Hui So Ying. "It's a great honor because the actress will make a giant trip. She is already some age, but has soon came to come. It will be very interesting to have a movie inspired by her life and count on her presence to share with us this moment," said Vanessa Pimentel.
Little known paths
Another highlight of the Film Show is the exhibition of the documentary “Four Trails”, which has been “a ticket phenomenon”. It is a movie about the 298-kilometer race for the four best known Hong Kong tracks.
The film portrays a daily reality "from the Hong Kong regions that almost no one knows." "It's a movie about the challenge of sports and people who, not being professional sportsmen, sign up and run, training all year long. It's interesting to see the challenge they propose and how they live," said Vanessa Pimentel, who also highlights "Never Too Late", "A movie about our relationship with the environment." Here one can glimpse "a very Asian and Chinese side of this perspective of what the environment is and what our relationship with nature is like."
There is later the "Montage of A Modern Motherhood", a movie that "has been playing the festivals a lot." “It's a movie that has a very interesting side, about motherhood and a perspective that, perhaps, may not be so romantic, about the idea that maternity is not just a sea of ​​roses, having any reverse,” says Vanessa Pimentel.
Here the artistic director of the show warns that the film “can challenge a little,” playing “in things that concern everyone, like this thing of family tradition and sharing in motherhood and paternity”.
Vanessa Pimentel assures that the first edition of the show was a success, with "about a thousand people going to the cinema in four days." "It was surprising to see a lot of new people, older and also many people of Chinese origin, that is, children of immigrants, eventually a second generation, who were born in Lisbon, speak Portuguese and live here with families. We had sessions with many Chinese to ask questions at the end of the sessions and had never seen it in Lisbon," he said.
Hong Kong's cinema show also comes to the script of viewers who usually go to festivals. "We have a very interesting audience, consisting of people who like cinema and go to other festivals. It is not often to see a program that, in Lisbon, focuses on Asian cinema. We have Doc Lisboa, or Indie, but in its programming the proportion of this cinema is much smaller.
Between the Hong Kong Film Festival and the future festival, the official says there is “exhibition space” in Lisbon and Portugal, because the Asian cinema is “very vast and rich, having a very high amount and quality relationship”.</description><pubDate>2025-09-11 23:54:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Visit | Montenegro believes in “more agile” visas regime for Portuguese</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/10/visita-montenegro-acredita-em-regime-de-vistos-mais-agil-para-portugueses/</link><description>On a visit to Macau, which lasted only a few hours, the Portuguese government leader was confident in a new regime to speed up the coming from Portuguese to Macau. Montenegro also praised the development of the territory and spoke at a “very positive” phase of the relations between Portugal and Macau
 
Portugal Prime Minister Luís Montenegro believes that the MSar will create a “more agile” regime for Portuguese citizens. The statements were made yesterday to journalists, when Montenegro was confronted that the Misrem had eliminated the attribution of a preferential regime for Portuguese citizens in accessing the resident identity ticket.
According to the Portuguese politician, the matter was discussed yesterday morning, in a meeting with the chief executive, who took place before the visit to the Portuguese School of Macau.
"We have a concern regarding the visas of residence of all those [Portuguese] who go to this territory with desire to work and to help the institutions can do their work," acknowledged the leader of the Government of Portugal. "Our staff are in contact and has been combined following what had already begun with the visit of the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, last March, […] I think things will be sent so that we can have the consecration of a more agile, easier, more experienced regime, and therefore, that we know that we know," he added.
When asked if the regime would be the same as applied before the Ho Iat Seng government propose its elimination, approved by the Legislative Assembly, Montenegro refused to enter details. "I cannot now be entering this detail. What we want, from the point of view of the authorities on both sides, is that all this dynamic is as easy as possible and, therefore, that the rules are fast and also so as not to disagree with this [Portuguese Portuguese] mobility that is positive mobility," he said.
Positive phase of cooperation
Montenegro also considered that he felt like the side of Macau to continue to receive Portuguese. "I believe yes [that there is a desire to have Portuguese in Macau], I think it was very clear from the conversation we had," he said.
As for the relationships between Portugal and Macau, Montenegro considered that they cross “a very positive phase” of cooperation, in the level of the economic, social, cultural and historical and entity aspects.
"We have registered a very strong commitment of the Macao Executive in the preservation of architectural heritage, of the historical heritage, which is also part of what is the identity of Macao," he said. "We want, in fact, that there will be compliance with a mutual cooperation relationship, which is based on the documents that have presided over the transition […] and that attributes responsibilities to all. And we will be up to our [responsibilities] and, of course, to request compliance with others," he added.
Some obstacles
Regarding the situation of Macao, Montenegro claimed to be “a good example”, although with some “obstacles” and “tensions”, which explained to be normal of these kinds of regions.
"I think that in global this is a good example of how it was possible to organize a transition process, to safeguard the most relevant interests in presence and contribute to the economic and social development of this territory," said the Prime Minister of Portugal. Numbers, although they do not express everything, are a good instrument for us to be able to gauge the economic and social success of this route and this process that is not free of tensions, is not free of obstacles. It is like in all processes that imply changes, something that is never truly finished and impels us to be pro-action, ”he shot. The leader of the government of Portugal did not specify the" obstacles "or the" tensions. "
Off the agenda
Speaking to journalists, Montenegro also addressed the case of the detention of former deputy Au Kam San, who also has Portuguese nationality. The Prime Minister revealed that the case was not part of the schedule of this trip and must be treated with discretion. "It was not the subject of our conversation, but it is a subject, this and others, which we follow and that we promote with the necessary description, because there are some subjects that also deserve some modesty in treatment. And this is one of them," he explained.
Montenegro also refused to explain whether there was any movement to support the detainee. "We are not discussing this case, I will not particularize. In this context of the visit, what I want to reiterate is our firm purpose in bringing our cooperation relationship to the most varied levels and the preservation of a connection that has been fruit, although it also has its problems," he said.
Sam Hou Fai guarantees Portuguese rights
The chief executive stated that the government of Macao attributes great importance to the rights and traditions of Portuguese resident in the territory. Sam Hou Fai's statements were made yesterday morning when he received Luís Montenegro, according to the Communication Office (GCS).
In a press release, it is reported that the representative of the MSAR stressed "that the government of MSAR has always attributed, throughout its development, great importance to the protection and respect for the rights, customs and cultural traditions of the Portuguese residents of Macao."
The government leader also associated the Portuguese traditions with the “teaching and diffusion of the Portuguese language”, which indicated to be the target of a proactive promotion by the executive.
The government leader also "stressed that the friendship between the Chinese and Portuguese peoples is long and lasting, and the two countries have been established for 20 years a broader strategic partnership, with a special emphasis on the use of the Macao platform in promoting exchange and sino-Portuguese cooperation."
In response, GCS indicates that Montenegro defended the implementation of the principle a country, two systems. "Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro praised the successful implementation of the principle" a country, two systems "in Macao and the huge advances made since its return to the country. He also praised the preservation of cultural diversity in Macao, including Portuguese culture," was reported.
Security | Montenegro's visit with great apparatus
Unlike visits by other Portuguese leaders Macao, as happened with Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, in 2019, Luís Montenegro's passage was marked by a large security apparatus, which was guaranteed by a team with security guards and Chinese agents, as well as the forces of the mashes. Before the Prime Minister of Portugal arrived at the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM), all who wanted to be inside the institution had to be searched. Also journalists or image reporters who had not registered beforehand could not enter.
Inside the institution there was also a dog accompanying one of the agents. Outside the school, when the car that carried Montenegro arrived, police warded the passers -by and prevented the passage. During the stop of the Montenegro car, the car was being protected by a higher van that stopped next to it to block one of the angles of vision. After passing the EPM, the area between the consulate of Portugal and the Sé Zone was full of security agents.
Culture | Montenegro highlights Portuguese “values”
During the speech of the reception to the Portuguese community, Luís Montenegro highlighted the “values” brought by the community in Macao, and in the main the diffusion of the language.
"I mean that we have attributed special importance to those who are here, in the most varied affinities, that bring the values ​​of Portugal, which bring and transport and preserve the Portuguese culture and tradition, which are therefore a link between our countries and our peoples," he said.
The ruler also said that the community "through work" can "take further" the "preservation of language", which considered it to be an "irreplaceable identity factor and also as a factor of approximation." In the economic aspect, Montenegro considered that the community contributes to the common objective of building “societies with prosperity”, with “opportunities for all” and promotes “equality and social justice”. The prime minister also promised to support the community: "It has the government of Portugal, we also have very with you," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-09-10 23:01:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Linguistics | Published study based on a trip to Macau in the 19th century</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/linguistica-publicado-estudo-baseado-numa-viagem-a-macau-no-seculo-xix/</link><description>The academic Anabela Leal de Barros has just published a linguistic study that focuses on the trip of Father Miranda and Oliveira, linked to the congregation of the mission, Macao in 1825. With history of history, details about the Portuguese of the time and Macao are revealed. The book will be presented at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center next Wednesday
 
“Voyage from Lisbon to Macau-1825” is the title of the latest work edited by Grand Fault, by the University of Minho Anabela Leal de Barros.
The book makes a critical and interpretative analysis of the Portuguese of the time left in the manuscript of the parish priest José Joaquim de Miranda and Oliveira, priest of the Mission Congregation. This documentation is in custody of the Braga District Archive. However, the work did not only exhaust the Portuguese of the time, revealing other historical details of Macao, Asia and a sea trip.
According to Anabela Leal de Barros to HM, the work is “as faithful as possible to the spelling of the manuscript”, to the virtually unknown date.
In this travel diary, Father Miranda and Oliveira "reveals enormous curiosity in the face of all the news and shares with us their names in the languages ​​of the world that baptized them, starting with ours."
This is how it explains situations such as “maritime nausea, a still relatively unknown and strongly invasive reality in vessels” in those days. The priest named or defined "the tones, the tones, the caravels, the beans, the flying, the Albacoras-all sorts of birds and fish that along the trip was admired, fished, or proved," or the "meteorological phenomena with local names-Cacimba, Samatra, Typho." There are also details about "cultural habits such as the chicken, Buio in Indonesian; the Philippines, the Berloches, and the ruling class of the nightgown, as well as to the sômas, Chinese vessels."
The vessel departed from Lisbon in April 1825 and was taking long in the Philippines, arriving in Macao on October 23. The arrival of "to the island of Caó" and the next day "to the College of St. Joseph", the "a city with" a magnificent port of commerce ", situated" in a pleasant wake peninsula ", with" good waters "and" famous buildings to the European ".
Linguistic varieties
In the work edited by Grand Fault there are, for example, "rich stories like that of the St. John's Orion, Frei Junipero's Cauldron or the habit of the marvelors shouting" Refresca S. Lourenço! "For the wind to blow, which is the meaning of" refreshing ".
There are also “allusions to the linguistic variety itself”, as “at various times it refers to foreigners made in Latin, in Indonesian-Holandal and Philippine-Spanish territory, the private teaching of English in the Philippines by the Mission Congregation; the little knowledge and use of the Spanish, even in Manila, and the variation of the tagal itself, a language in which the priest is concerned to leave the registered. Hail Mary ”.
Before reaching this travel report, Anabela Leal de Barros was already in the intricacies of the investigation of this type of manuscripts, facing the history of another priest, “the greatest Portuguese synologist, Joaquim Afonso Gonçalves, who had traveled from the same Rilhafoles House of the Mission Mission Congregation in 1812”.
According to the author, this parish priest "dedicated the last twenty -nine years of her life to the mission of evangelization in China, and in particular to the investigation and teaching of the Chinese at the College of S. José in Macau." Throughout his life, "this transmontano wrote more than five thousand pages of grammars and dictionaries in Portuguese, Latin and Chinese, expressly dedicated to his college students, seven printed in his typography and at least two manuscripts."
Then, in 2017, António Lázaro, from the Department of History of the University of Minho, and director of the Confucius Institute, made the Anabela Leal de Barros available “a list of references to manuscripts of the Braga District Archive on Macau and China”. Then, a "trip" that culminated in the edition of this study began.
"This book is the first result of a project of my editing and study of unpublished manuscripts of travel literature whose main objective is exactly this: contribute to the valorization and consolidation of the microhistory of the discoveries and memory of history, among the fifteenth centuries."
Accompanied by travel
José Joaquim de Miranda and Oliveira took about seven months to Macau, from Lisbon on April 1, 1825, and arriving in East on October 24 of the same year. He departed on the ship Vasco da Gama with three other priests of the Congregation: João da França de Castro and Moura, Jerónimo José da Mata and José Ferreira da Silva.
According to Anabela Leal de Barros, “the manuscript does not seem to have been cleaned by the author himself, given the type of spelling variation and jacks and amendments he has”, probably “transferred, to safeguard copies, by some macanese member of the college, since the Portuguese of Macao in the nineteenth century, had characteristics compatible with certain traces, still a priest from Portugal, what a young man ”.
This travel diary "ends on the day of arrival in Macao, with the brief presentation of the city and the college, being clear the Catholic perspective of the time in the face of the Chinese cult of the ancestors and without getting attention to the mere five thousand Christians in the 40 to 50 thousand inhabitants of the city."
Political hostilities
José Joaquim de Miranda and Oliveira describes how the bishop of Macau did not receive the entourage, which is “enough to lead us to the hostile context in which Lazarists were, defenders of liberalism, which had led Joaquim Afonso Gonçalves, a few years earlier, to take refuge in the Philippines, with the college with two of his masters.”
In addition, “throughout the trip the priest does not fail to narrate all the moments when he performs his daily mission, with the administration of the sacraments, the prayer of responses and the celebration of masses, but above all records the remarkable lack of priests that reveal the Christianized peoples, in particular in Batávia, current Jakarta, where the community of Portuguese origin, of more than one thousand, had only one thousand people, had an old priest. ”
In these reports, the concern is also the concern of “recalling the first French martyrs of the congregation in the attempt to evangelize Madagascar and to report the presence of friars and priests from the various congregations, from Cape Verde to the Philippines, where they are recognized as most important for the solidity of Spanish rule than their army”.
According to Anabela Leal de Barros, the report also alluded to Java in Java, "to Lutherans and Mosytans, as well as to the religions of China and, in Manila, to the persecution of Christians (referring to" dinner ", ie lunch with a Christian Chinese," and as such ").
Miranda and Oliveira will have had “a very diplomatic and convivial conduct, ensuring the establishment and maintenance of cordial relations between the various orders and also with the governors and foreign powers in presence, from the Dutch to the Spanish, who visit in all stops”.
A project ongoing
In these years, it was a dangerous adventure to travel by boat, facing “anthropophagous peoples, piracy, embarking diseases and epidemics”, a “perfectly cinematic view” already described in those Lusíadas, by Luís de Camões. Those who boarded these trips were also alone, "individually and in a small ship just more than a nutshell, in front of an endless sea, for months, when it was common for several passengers not to reach the destination, or not to return a ship from a complete squad."
In the account of Miranda and Oliveira “there is no big news” in view of previous reports, but “we are intended for the main difficulties of the sea journey to Asia in the nineteenth century: the stones existing before the Belém Tower, which caused not a few wrecks; and the sickness, which deserves even definition for the many readers who had never put their feet into a boat, and about which it refers to the captain of the captain Ladies nauseated to climb the awning and work, as it is the best medicine. ”
There is also "the episode of the man lying in the sea of ​​the plow that accompanied them in part of the trip, which they could not save - a death to which everyone was so exposed, as the narrator says." Also noteworthy is another potential period on such trips, "the encounter with ships that, not immediately raising any flag, or raising it without giving true confidence, immediately led to the decision to light the horsepower and open fire, which well translates the dimension of piracy and the fears that imposed."
Essentially, "the main character of maritime trips was the wind," which led the still "young priest" to "twice evocating the Camonian verses of the storm."
After the arrival in Macau, Miranda and Oliveira left for his post in Nanjing, "on a comparatively longer trip than the first, received by Christians at cost and secretly." "In the face of persecution," it succumbs "to the dangers and diseases of land at the age of 31, far from all its confreres, as early as November 1, 1828, just two years after the difficult farewell of his spiritual family in Lisbon has described." “The more longevity of their traveling companions, one of which would become Bishop of Macau and the other, of Beijing and Porto,” says Anabela Leal de Barros.</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 01:39:42</pubDate></item><item><title>China | Montenegro expects “close relationship” fruits with Russia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/09/china-montenegro-espera-frutos-de-relacao-proxima-com-a-russia/</link><description>The Portuguese Prime Minister said yesterday, in a meeting with President Xi Jinping, who expects the “close relationship” between China and Russia to help reach a peace agreement in Ukraine. Official visit to China, with Macau, Luís Montenegro stressed China's fundamental role in the global context
 
The Portuguese Prime Minister said yesterday, before the President of the Popular Republic of China, Xi Jinping, who has his close relationship with Russia to “build a fair and lasting peace” in Ukraine.
Luís Montenegro made these statements at the beginning of the first day of the official visit to China, during the meeting with Xi Jinping, of which journalists could only record the first three minutes. "I can not help, on behalf of the government of Portugal, to transmit to the President that we count a lot with your contribution and the close relationship that China maintains with the Russian Federation to be able, as fast as possible, build just and lasting peace in Ukraine," he said.
Earlier, Montenegro stressed that, in the international context, Portugal and China have maintained "on many occasions a base of cooperation and sharing of values." "China has a key role in the global and international context, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and we expect your contribution to build bridges between peoples, bring some of those who are in conflict, promote peace, promote multilateralism, promote respect for human rights," said the Portuguese politician.
Montenegro said he was confident that the appeal he addressed to the president of China about the Russian-Ukraine conflict will be heard. "I believe that the appeal, coming from a friendly country, coming from a European Union (EU) country, coming from a country, such as Mr. President XI Jinping also emphasized, who has an identity of values ​​and route, will not fall into a rotor bag," he said.
Saying not being able to answer for the president of China, Montenegro expressed convinced that Portugal has done what is required to this conflict.
"My conviction is that, to our dimension and without any kind of pretentiousness, we do what is required to a nation with history and the international respectability that Portugal has. We are builders of bridges, we are protagonists of the approach between peoples, we are advocates of peace, defenders of values, respect for people's rights," he said.
Montenegro considered that, at the meeting with Xi Jinping, he was limited to “being frank, loyal and direct in the appeal” so that China's ability to influence and “bring practical results” to Ukraine.
Luís Montenegro also mentioned that “it is very tasteful” that he makes this official visit to China, after brief statements by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
"As Mr. President said, Portugal and China have a relationship founded on a story that has shared with various times in common, but also a relationship facing the future. I remember Mr. President's visit to Portugal for seven years and I also want to convey the greetings of Mr. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa," he said.
Good friends
The Portuguese Prime Minister expressed agreement with the words of Xi Jinping about how the transition from the administration of Macao de Portugal to China in 1999 took place.
"We had in the transition from Macau a good expression of the way we were able to converge and we managed to ensure the cultural identity and the relationship between the special administrative region of Macau, with Portugal and with China," he said.
At yesterday's meeting, Xi Jinping said that “Portugal is a good friend of China”, saying that it is “a pleasure” to meet the Prime Minister, Luís Montenegro.
“Welcome on the visit to China. I remember that in 2018 I made a state visit to Portugal, which left me a beautiful impression, and deep,” he said, taking the opportunity to ask Montenegro to transmit to the Portuguese head of state, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, “sincere greetings”, according to the simultaneous translation into Portuguese of his statements.
The Chinese president stressed that China and Portugal "are countries with deep history, and the two peoples have idiosyncrasy, openness, inclusion, progress and autonomy", arguing that "Portugal plays an important and unique role on the international stage."
Xi Jinping also highlighted “the important role” played by three former Portuguese prime ministers in international and regional affairs.
"The Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres, the president of the European Council, António Costa, and the former president of the European Commission Durão Barroso. I have good relations with them," he said.
In the brief statement, the Chinese president stated that "Portugal is a good friend of China" and considered that both countries have "properly resolved" the issue of Macao through friendly negotiations. "
"Portugal was also the first country in Western Europe to sign with China acts of cooperation under the initiative" a track, a route ", and the first country in the euro zone that issued titles" in the Chinese currency, he said.
A little help in the crisis
In turn, Luís Montenegro thanked China for the support of Portugal during the period of the financial crisis. "At the level of our bilateral economic cooperation, it is my duty to tell you that we do not forget, on the contrary, we have very well present and respect the bet that China has developed in the Portuguese economy, in one of the most critical moments of our country, when the financial crisis," he said.
As had been highlighted moments earlier by the President of the Popular Republic of China, Montenegro also considered that, in recent years, the two countries have reinforced ties "in various sectors of the economy, from energy to bank, from health to water supply." "Our conviction is that we can continue to walk this path on the basis of trust," said the prime minister.
Luís Montenegro landed in Beijing early Monday afternoon, closed to the media, and did not have any public agenda that day. The prime minister's official agenda began yesterday morning with a ceremony of deposition of a wreath at the monument to the people of the people, in Tiananmen Square, where he was accompanied by his wife and three ministers who are part of this visit: Paulo Rangel, Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, Manuel Castro Almeida, Minister of Economics and Territorial Cohesion, and Graça Carvalho, Minister of Environment and Energy.
In addition to the meeting with Xi Jinping, Luís Montenegro met first with the president of the China National Popular Assembly, Zhao Leji.
In the late afternoon, the head of the Portuguese government had a work of work with the Chinese counterpart, I read Qiang, also at the Great Palace of the People, having followed to Macao, where he has today schedule only in the morning. Tomorrow and Friday, Montenegro will make an official visit to Japan, with tickets for Tokyo and Osaka.
Pilfe
At HM, analyst Tiago André Lopes, an auxiliary professor responsible for Asia Study at Lusíada do Porto University, argued that “Lisbon and Beijing share quite different views regarding international conflicts”. It should be noted that Montenegro visits China when they spend a few days about the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which took place in the Chinese town of Tianjin, and where conflicts were discussed Gaza or Russia-Ucrania.
"We can see that Lisbon is distinctive in the Palestinian issue, looking little uncomfortable with the barbarism that is slaughtered over the Palestinians; while China positions itself in a different spectrum from Portugal in the Ukraine War. What does this tell us? The trip will be very focused on the dimension of economic diplomacy and much less in the so -called traditional diplomacy," said the analyst.
Tiago André Lopes considers that Portugal could take advantage of this trip through Asia "to self-admit some of the dependence on the Brussels-Washington axis and gain space for maneuver by integrating Beijing's Force," although "the current government bets on an atlanticism-Europeist without global ambitions."
Asked about the issue of 5G, which guided the Portugal-China relationship in recent months, Tiago André Lopes understands that Montenegro's trip to Beijing serves to "minimize the impact" of this issue and "try to leverage economic cooperation between the two countries."
"An element that can help measure the pulse of the Portuguese Prime Minister's visit will be the signing of documents. Will be signed memorandum of understanding (which are generally not binding), or commercial agreements? Or only press notes? This will be the best barometer, beyond the words of circumstance that will naturally be delivered," he said.
Investments | Montenegro says Portugal is “reliable and confident”
Luís Montenegro said yesterday that during the official visit to China and then Japan, he wants to bring the message that Portugal “is a reliable and confident country” for economic investments.
According to the Prime Minister, the program “Gives the opportunity that the Portuguese Prime Minister has to talk and interact directly with the President of the National Assembly of the Popular Republic of China, with the President of the Republic, with the Prime Minister”.
"At the same time that the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Economy and the Minister of Environment and Energy interact bilaterally with their counterparts and also with entrepreneurs and Chinese companies that operate in Portugal and with Portuguese companies operating in China," he added.
For Montenegro, the fact that the visits are being made “with some compression in terms of durability” - four days divided between China and Japan - should be seen from another perspective.
"It is just the record that we are able to do all this simultaneously, we are able to leave here to Macau, we are able to go to Tokyo and to be able, in this geographical area, to bring the message that Portugal is a confident country, is a reliable country, it is a country where it is worth looking and that also looks to the world," he defended.
Montenegro also pointed out that Portugal is already “enjoying several investments that originate in China and have been levers for the transformation and economic development of Portugal”.
"It is our intention to contribute to our coming here so that we can also open doors to which more Portuguese companies can find in the Chinese market the destination of their products and, therefore, also increase our export share for this geography," he said.

In a report by Lusa agency, there are details of the “MPOP” style of the election campaign, with a lot of music and requests for financial support to the mixture
 
Crowded audience, all dressed in the gowns on the list with which they compete for the elections on the 14th; Chinese drums next to the stage and above candidates and supporters, various microphones, music and choreography. This is the campaign for Macao legislatures, in a style that can be called "MPOP".
The microphones change hands, reproducing the same slogans with different voices, in short and acute scales, which end almost all in a party instruction. At this point, the drums are listened to loudly and the audience reproduces the last note heard, while shaking the political 'merchandising' that is handed over to the start of the rally: plastic hands to clap, numbers on the list with led lights, malleable straws, fans, all with the same color.
Campaign actions in Macao, restricted to the last two weeks before legislative elections for the local parliament, do not contain speeches in the events of the six lists that will elect 14 of the 33 deputies to the Legislative Assembly (AL).
The remaining 12 candidates are chosen through the associations, through the indirect suffrage, and there are still seven deputies appointed by the Chief Executive, in this case Sam Hou Fai.
Describing campaign events is like an exercise of musical shows, namely the genus "Kpop", among the lists led by younger candidates, or the genre "pop old-myle", as if it was figures like Elvis or Olivia Newton John Risen.
The concentrations are made up of the members of the lists and the people mobilized by them, some and the other dresses with the same uniforms. But there are no politicians on stage and viewers listening to them.
In these events, politicians seem to be assumed as artists, but there are no audiences, because they seem to be part of the choreography. Finally, there are very few people besides and each other, that is, people watching who are not directly linked to the lists.
Abstention is the great ghost that hangs over the whole process, which takes place for the first time under the framework of the new Electoral Law of April 2024, which aims to "reinforce the implementation of the" Macao Macao governed by Patriotas "principle.
Economic challenges
Ilia Chou, 40, an employee of the financial sector, was with a child and a friend watching one of these rallies and seemed to be one of those few people present not involved in the campaign list. He agreed to talk to Lusa after he had spoken to another microphone.
Ilia was attracted to the list that was there because those people have a "young and community aspect" and are concerned with "offering prospects for progress" to young people. "Given the current challenging economic climate, we face a critical question: our young people now have fewer options than before. This specific aspect is what attracts me most in this initiative," he said.
But “other groups also talk about youth and employment, what are the differences? Why do you like this particular group?” We asked. "I don't know them [the other groups]. Well, I was attracted to the charming characters of this list," he replied. "I think these four characters quite charming," Ilia added, they talk about "love, the title is very charming, and the color is pink, it looks very welcoming."
Political programs are, without exception, lists of requests to an “provider father”, incarnated by the executive, who has the responsibility of managing a comfortable and growing financial reserve, fueled by taxes paid by the six game dealers in Macao.
The numbers show this comfort. In August, the Macao Financial Reserve, which was always growing throughout the first half, reached 647.3 billion patacas, and was applied in subcontracted investments, deposits, current accounts, and credit securities.
Lists want to be applied to initiatives such as the creation of a development fund and the reversal of 10 percent profits for distribution by all citizens, want to increase pensions or more money in consumer coupons, subsidies and maternity licenses, want more social housing, want free health and higher education, or simply require greater annual money distribution.
Pasta
There are also other requirements, such as promoting the diversification of the economy, measures to support the transformation and modernization of small and medium -sized enterprises or development of the intelligent city, but the most significant part of the six lists shows directly to the government's distribution of money in the most varied forms.
The other recipients of the requests are the game dealers, to which the candidates go with warnings that they are determined to defend the priority of residents in access to the best paid jobs.
Macao's unemployment rate is 2 percent and permanent residents at 2.6 percent. That is, technically, Macau has full employment. However, as Lusa told a candidate, the employment issue has nothing to do with statistics, it just holds on with "perception."
And in fact the question of unemployment, especially those who have just graduated, is a pressing issue of political programs, as HM indicated. This is the case of the first list to compete for direct suffrage, the “Association of United Citizens of Macao”, which is led by Song Pek Kei, a deputy linked to the Fujian community, who took the first steps in politics alongside businessman Chan Meng Kam.
The list led by the deputy asks, for example, the creation of a share for residents in all professional areas, “support for employment and local companies”, and the guarantee that “85 percent, or more, employees are local residents”.
The Nova Esperança list, led by José Pereira Coutinho, and one of the few macanese participants in these elections, asks for “employment for all”, a slogan present in his electoral program where the “employment priority for Macao's permanent residents is promised at game dealers”.
Who goes out to their
List campaigns for indirect suffrage may seem more discreet, but that doesn't mean there is no news. After investing in Global Media, Portugal, and betting on the real estate area, in Porto, Kevin Ho, the nephew of the first chief executive, Edmund Ho, bet on local politics, when entering the list “Union of Macao Business Interests”, led by José Chui Sa Peng. Also he is familiar, in this case, from a previous head of the Executive of MSAR, Chui Sai On, already removed from the political scene.
In the case of these lists, representative of the sectors of labor, culture, education or business interests, employment is a concern, but what the candidates are looking for is a government that can support companies and finally diversify the economy.
Thus, in the “union of business interests of Macao”, it is advocated “support for digital and high technology transformation to modernize traditional industries and develop emerging sectors”. Candidates promise to play the role of intermediaries between those who have difficulty maintaining in this business fabric and the executive by “listening carefully to the difficulties and claims of the commercial and financial industries, especially small and medium enterprises”. The names of the seven appointed deputies are not yet known, as the Chief Executive's choice is usually made public only after the elections.

The authorities in the neighboring region have long called for the withdrawal, including official visits to Portugal. The Portugal-Hong Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kong emphasizes the decision consistent with the position of the European Union
 
The Hong Kong government has finally seen the desire, expressed several times, to leave the list of tax havens in Portugal. The change will be a reality from January 1, 2026, taking into account the ordinance published on Friday by the Ministry of Finance in the Diário da República.
According to this document, Hong Kong is no longer included in the list of “clearly more favorable tax regimes”, the official name of the list commonly known as the “Fiscal Paradise List”.
It reads at the Ordinance, signed by the Secretary of State for Tax Affairs, Claudia Reis Duarte, that “the governments of the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the East Republic of Uruguay drove formal requests” to the “revision of their framing in the list, which were the subject of positive opinions elaborated by the Tax and Customs Authority”. The withdrawal of these three countries and territories is officially on January 1 of next year.
Thus, the Portuguese Government considers that the conditions are verified to, in the legally established terms, exclude those jurisdictions from the list of countries, territories or regions with clearly more favorable tax regimes ”.
It is also noteworthy that “the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay are not on the European Union of Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction List, adopted by the European Union Council, which took place on February 18, 2025”.
It is recalled that one of the last times that Hong Kong made a formal request to leave the list of tax havens was during the visit to Lisbon of the Secretary for Financial and Treasury Services, Christopher Hui Ching-Yu, last year, as a meeting with Secretary of State Claudia Reis Durte.
There, and according to Lusa, the ruler of the neighboring region "expressed concern" for Hong Kong being considered a fiscal paradise since the list was created by the Portuguese authorities in 2004.
The inclusion in the list “would subject Hong Kong companies to a tax increase and special measures” in Portugal, described the ruler, who recalled that the two parties signed an agreement to prevent double taxation, which came into force in 2012.
In the same meeting, Christopher Hui reminded the Portuguese Secretary of State that the European Union (EU) removed, in February 2024, Raehk from the non -cooperative jurisdiction list for tax purposes, a decision that, in the secretary's understanding, "demonstrated the recognition of the EU of Hong Kong's efforts" to introduce measures that combat "the [fiscal] transfronio evasion resulting from the pair not the pair not taxation ”. Christopher Hui added that Hong Kong already fulfilled all European standards in this matter.
It should be noted that, at the time, the Portuguese Minister of the Economy was Pedro Reis, who at an event about Christopher Hui's visit to Lisbon, said it was important to “maintain sustainable economic growth and take advantage of the opportunities for mutual investment” between Portugal and Hong Kong.
Chamber of Commerce Rejubila
However, the Portugal-Hong Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kong (PHKCCI, in the English acronym) issued a note in LinkedIn to highlight Hong Kong's exit from this list. "This milestone represents the culmination of a long-term and transverse process in Portugal, which involved continuous dialogue and coordination between successive governments, parliamentary parties and international partners. Although the consensus on the objective was solid, the process has gradually unfolded over more than a decade," he reads.
For PHKCCI, the Portuguese State decision “restores coherence with the European Union's rules and reflects Portugal's commitment to a fair and current approach to its tax governance”, also stressing the “importance of respecting objective criteria, maintaining a permanent dialogue and ensuring legal and diplomatic rigor in the management of fiscal policy”.
“As a chamber of commerce and industry Portugal-Hong Kong, we greeted this outcome as a step forward in the alignment of our bilateral environment of commerce and investment with predictability, transparency and good governance. We maintain a committed to facilitating constructive involvement between our markets, supporting the clarity in tax staff and fostering mutual confidence”, is referred to in the same note.
According to the online newspaper Eco, the inclusion of a country or territory on the list of tax havens happens if there is no tax similar to IRC [tax on the income of legal persons], charged in Portugal, or the existence of tax benefits that are more favorable than in the European country.
It also serves as a criterion for inclusion in the list administrative practices of countries or regions do not allow the effective exchange of tax information. All issues that Hong Kong considers to have exceeded and ensure that there is full respect for the fight against fiscal dropout.
More concretely, and when his visit to Portugal last year, Secretary Christopher Hui spoke of the “Hong Kong efforts in the introduction of a foreign source performance regime (FSIE) for certain passive income to better combat transionic dropout resulting from the non -taxation”. In his view, "such efforts fully aligned the Hong Kong FSIE regime with FSIE regimes updated by the EU regimes in December 2022".
MEXIDES IN FSIE
According to an explanatory note from consultant PriceWaterhousecoopers (PWC), Hong Kong was added to the EU Observation list in October 2021. On that date, the EU was concerned that, under the then Foreign Source Exemption Scheme (FSIE), there could be situations in which companies without substantial economic activity in Hong Kong would not be subject to Tax regarding certain passive income from a foreign source (such as interest and royalties), thus resulting in situations of 'double non-tax', ”can be read.
The following year, Raehk "promulgated legislative changes", namely in December 2022, to "improve and reinforce the FSIE regime against transfronical fiscal evasion."
With the changes in force since 1 January 2023, “the four types of foreign source income”, such as dividends, interest, intellectual property income and alienation gains from the sale of corporate interests, are “being considered origin in Hong Kong and subject to profit tax if received in Hong Kong by an entity of a multinational group that exercises trade, profession or business in the business Territory, ”explains PWC,“ except if this entity meets the requirements of the applicable exception ”.
After the EU's suggestion, "the Raehk government further perfected the FSIE regime to widen the scope of the covered incomes, including alienation gains from other types of assets (beyond corporate appearances) in order to align with the latest EU orientation, with effect from 1 January 2024".
It was then that on February 20 last year the EU council published the conclusions of the semiannual EU review regarding the “non -cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes”, the so -called “black list” of tax havens, as well as the “observation list” regarding the “state of cooperation with the EU in relation to the commitments made by cooperative jurisdictions to implement principles of good tax governance”.
At that time Hong Kong was removed from the list, considering the EU that the territory had "fulfilled the commitment by changing the FSIE regime", highlighting PWC, in the same note, that Raehk is now "among the jurisdictions that cooperate with the EU and have no pending commitments."
According to PWC, "the Raehk government greeted the recognition of the EU of efforts to align its FSIE regime with the relevant requirements, as reflected in its removal from the EU observation list", and will also have "will continue to comply with international tax standards, while maintaining Hong Kong fiscal competitiveness."</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 02:09:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Traders warn of consequences of the satellite casinos closure</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/comerciantes-alertam-para-consequencias-do-fecho-de-casinos-satelite/</link><description>Entrepreneurs told Lusa that the closure of satellite casinos threatens the survival of economic sectors that depend on them, such as the pledge houses and the luxury trade.
The streets of Zape and Nape zones, once excited by players, are being deserted. "The pledge houses in these areas will simply close or change. I don't see another solution," Macao General Association of Penhoers, Alexander Wai Kai Leung told Lusa.
It is expected that at least nine of the city's 11 satellite casinos cease operations by December 31, a period of a period of grace period of three years granted to agreements between the operators of the game spaces and the dealers under which they operated.
Among the satellite casinos located in the areas of Zape and NAPE are the Casa Real, Fortune, Kam Pek, Landmark, Legend Palace and Waldo. Lusa tried to contact the hotels that houses these spaces, but none of its employees could indicate what the future of the place will be after closing. Grand Emperor serves as an example: the casino has closed three years ago and the facilities remain empty to this day.
"If casinos close, the impact on us is significant. Our livelihood depends on players," Leung said, also expressing the hope that the satellite casinos will remain open.
Letter of intent
The Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) told Lusa that it “intends to attract visitors” to the Zape area to support local commerce. Measurements for the doing include events, improvement of the urban landscape and the offer of special packages directed to concert spectators, which include 'vouchers' of purchases and museum tickets.
Entrepreneurs like Leong remain, nevertheless, skeptical. The president of the Penhores Houses Association questions these measures, considering them even useless for the pledge houses.
"Our industry depends on players as their main customers. They can attract people to dinner on the street, but I don't see how it benefits us," he said, adding that he feels that the sector has been "marginalized by the authorities, who consider the" high risk "business for capital bleaching." According to the association, there are about 25 pledge houses in the area of ​​Zape and Nape.
The threat extends beyond the pledge houses. Stool shop windows like the In Vo Chong group display shark fins, whiskey premium and Moutai, captivating a wealthy clientele.
Owner, Lok Chi Lai, Deputy Secretary General of the Hong Kong and Macau Swallow Nests Association, recognizes government efforts to increase the influx of people other than gaming space regulars. However, he told Lusa, these initiatives “cannot attract high range customers to consume”, only attract “young people to take photographs”, clarifying that there are more than 40 establishments of this kind in both areas of the city.
"Those who come to play are willing to buy luxury goods at higher prices to offer. Without these customers, the future doesn't look so laughing," Lok said. On the other hand, he added, promoting hotel offer located at Zape and Nape is also ineffective because "the hotels here are old (…), and high -end customers prefer to stay in five -star hotels in Cotai."</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:12:56</pubDate></item><item><title>AMCM | Macao and Cape Verde regulators reinforce cooperation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/amcm-reguladores-de-macau-e-cabo-verde-reforcam-cooperacao/</link><description>The new agreement was signed on Thursday and announced the next day. The signature took place during the 12th edition of the Central Banks Governors Meeting of Portuguese -Speaking Countries, in Praia City
 
The Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM) has announced that it signed a new agreement to “deepen cooperation” in matters in financial supervision with the Cape Verde Central Bank. The financial regulator said the protocol with the Cape Verde bank covers the “fight against the laundering of capital and the financing of terrorism, technical cooperation, the formation of professional staff”.
According to a statement, the agreement also covers "the supervision and exchange related to emerging financial services, with the aim of jointly safeguarding the safety and stability of the respective financial systems." The document was signed on Thursday, during the 12th edition of the Governors of the Central Banks of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, held in the capital of Cape Verde, Praia.
The meeting, which took place at the closed door, included interventions of governors and representatives of the central banks of Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe, and Timor-Leste as well as the Central Bank of West African States and the Bank of Central Africa States.
“This initiative symbolizes a deepening of cooperation and exchange between the two institutions in the field of financial supervision,” added AMCM. "This new agreement focuses particularly on the collaboration in the field of prudential supervision, establishing a specific framework for cooperation between AMCM and Cape Verde Bank," added the regulator.
Since 1999
AMCM signed the first cooperation and technical assistance agreement with the Cape Verde Bank in 1999. In September 2024, during the second conference of the central banks and the financial areas between China and the Portuguese -speaking countries, which took place in Macao, Macau's financial regulator announced that it would update the protocol with the homologous institution of Cape Verde.
AMCM has already celebrated bilateral cooperation agreements with 12 financial supervision authorities from eight Portuguese -speaking countries.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:11:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | Revenue rises 6% in September despite super typhoon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/jogo-receitas-sobem-6-em-setembro-apesar-de-super-tufao/</link><description>Macao casinos revenues rose in September 6 percent compared to the same period of 2024, despite the temporary closure due to Super Typhoon Ragasa. Still, last month was the second weaker this year
 
The game sector raised 18.3 billion Patacas last month, another 6 percent of September last year. The registration represented the second lowest monthly amount of 2025, revealed the Macao Game Inspection and Game Coordination Directorate.
Still, revenues have increased in annual terms, despite the passage of Ragasa, which led the authorities of the Chinese semi -autonomous region to end the casinos for 33 hours. Operators will have lost 880 million patacas in revenues, almost 5 percent from September, estimated Jeffrey Kiang, analyst at CLSA consultant, quoted by the Ggraia news portal.
The amount recorded in September represents 82.8 percent of the same month of 2019, when Macao casinos had revenues of 22.1 billion patacas.
Compared to the previous month, territory casinos loved 17.5 percent gross revenues. However, it should be noted that in August this year, the Macao game industry recorded the best monthly performance of this January 2020, with gross revenues around 22.16 billion.
Widen
In terms of accumulated gross revenue, the first nine months of 2025 recorded an increase of 7.1 percent over the same period last year, reaching 181.3 billion patacas. Macao closed 2024 with total revenues of 226.8 billion patacas, more 23.9 percent than the previous year.
The Macao government predicted, in the initial budget for 2025, that the year would close with total revenues of 240 billion patacas, which would represent a 6 percent increase compared to last year. But on June 11, the Legislative Assembly approved a new budget, proposed by the executive, which reduces the forecast for public revenues by 4.56 billion.
Secretary for Economics and Finance, Anton Tai Kin IP, admitted to the deputies that the cut is due to the fact that the game's gross gross revenues in the first trimester of 2025 "was" slightly below planned.

The document points out that since 2021 there have been no convictions of traffickers, while the Executive denounces prejudice and “severe interference and expressed in the internal affairs of the MSAR”
 
“This 'report' has denied the MSAR and contains defamatory and arbitrary statements related to the remarkable fruits obtained by the MSAR, so it has no credibility. The US has elaborated, year after year, reports with false information regarding issues of persons, in an attempt to launch confusion in international society, constituting serious and expressed interference in the internal affairs of the fields. of security they vehemently repudiate this "report" and strongly demonstrate their dissatisfaction. " This is how the government of Sam Hou Fai reacted to another report prepared by the US State Department on Human Trafficking, published on Monday.
The strong opposition of the local executive was made public on Tuesday at the end of the day, with the government mentioning that the document "is full of political prejudices and subjective judgments, as well as ignoring the objective facts."
The fact, evidenced by the department led by Marco Rubio, that Macau rarely condemns suspects involved in human trafficking, or identifies victims, is justified by the “joint efforts” of the Macao government and society. "Crimes related to trafficking in people have always recorded a low percentage or almost null percentage, which shows that Macau is one of the safest cities in the world," the government states.
The value of the word
The organism that belongs to the Trump administration acknowledges that the Macao government "has taken a few steps to combat human trafficking, namely investigating potential affairs, training staff and organizing seminars in schools to increase awareness for the subject." However, “general efforts to apply the law against trafficking and protection to victims remained inappropriate”, is indicated.
The report also points out that MSAR authorities considered in the past that the victim's initial consent or their “voluntary association” with a trafficker constituted sufficient evidence to demonstrate that a trafficking crime had not occurred. ”This stance, according to the State Department, causes the authorities to treat trafficking cases and weakens the victims' identification efforts.
Reports of observers are also highlighted that pointed to the lack of comprehensive legislation against trafficking in China negatively affected Macao's authorities to conduct joint operations, something that caused a “disproportionate impact” in combating human trafficking, as “victims explored in Macao were predominantly from the interior of China”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 01:56:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Administration | Johnson Ian defends new mindset</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/administracao-johnson-ian-defende-nova-mentalidade/</link><description>Former candidate for the Legislative Assembly, Johnson Ian, argues that the main problem of public administration will not be solved with government reform.

Regarding recent changes in government, Ian said it was the first time this type of remodeling happened in 26 years of MSAR after the transfer of sovereignty.
However, former number two on the list headed by Deputy Ron Lam pointed out that the changes will be in vain, if the government does not know how to respond to social expectations, hold the rulers responsible for their actions, listen to public consultations and use the public purse well.
Ian also addressed the news that about the fusion of cultural institutes and sports.

The chief executive foresees the official visit to Portugal in the first half of next year, after the postponement of September. The temporal goal was drawn on Wednesday, on the sidelines of the ceremonies of the 76th anniversary of the implementation of the Popular Republic of China.
"I have communicated with Prime Minister Montenegro, and when he came to Macau told him that my wish was that my first visit abroad would be to Portugal," said Sam Hou Fai, according to Macau channel. "Now we are preparing the new lines of government action, but, I hope the visit can be made in the beginning of next year. Only then will we plan the visits to other countries," he added.
Governing lines of action should be presented at the Legislative Assembly from November, until December, and constitute the governance plan for next year.
The Chief Executive also highlighted the importance of visiting the MSAR, as it consider that it is a way to promote development. "[The trip] is a very important action for our development and I am convinced that it can be held in the first half of next year," he said.
Postponed visit
Initially, Sam Hou Fai's official visit to Portugal, which included a spell in Spain, was scheduled for the period between September 16 and 23.
However, a few days from the trip, the executive announced the postponement without being advanced an official justification or a new date. "The visit was postponed and there is no date of when it will be made," said at the time source of the Social Communication Office (GCS), quoted by the agency Lusa.
However, the platform newspaper revealed that the postponement of the trip will have been related to the Portuguese Prime Minister's agenda. Between September 9 and 12, Luís Montenegro visited China and Japan, and the itinerary program in the Japanese country will have led the Portuguese authorities to consider that it would be more opportune to receive the leader of the government of Macao on another occasion.
However, when Macao moved from 9 to 10 September, Luís Montenegro was received by Sam Hou Fai, in a meeting that took place at the closed door at the government's headquarters. If the visit had not been postponed, the two would have held two meetings in just over a week.</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 01:48:07</pubDate></item><item><title>AL | André Cheong promises to use experience for greater connection with government</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/al-andre-cheong-promete-utilizar-experiencia/</link><description>The future deputy André Cheong promised to use his experience to implement a “beneficial interaction” between the executive and the legislature.
The promises were left on the sidelines of the celebrations of National Day. "I will use my experience to promote beneficial interaction between the executive and the legislature, thus contributing to the work of the Legislative Assembly," said André Cheong.
On the other hand, the still secretary said he will contribute to the hemiciclo, regardless of whether he is appointed president of the Legislative Assembly: “The President of the Legislature Assembly will be elected among the deputies. Whatever the place I will make, I will make my best contribution,” he said. The secretary also revealed that with the appointment to AL will leave the position in the Executive Council, in which he is a member and spokesman, and the Development Commission of the Deepened Cooperation Zone.
Administration | Wong will follow the objectives of the predecessor
After taking over the administration and justice folder, starting October 16, Wong Sio Chak promised to follow the priorities defined by the predecessor, André Cheong.
"Secretary André Cheong has clearly defined the measures of the upcoming lines of government action. Therefore, in the first place, I will boost these guidelines and goals defined by Secretary André Cheong," said Wong Sio Chak on Wednesday in statements to journalists.
"Among the priorities is restructuring, with the aim of simplifying management. Then we want to raise the capacity of civil servants. I hope that measures can be launched in this regard. Increased management efficiency is also a priority for the future," he added.

The MSAR prosecutor and future secretary for security, Chan Tsz King, is confident in his abilities to take over the new position. “In fact, the Public Prosecution Service and safety have similar work. Both have the responsibility to ensure stability and social order.
We have to collaborate and cooperate permanently. The works are always intended to ensure social stability, ”said Chan, quoted by Macau channel.“ I am confident that I will quickly adapt and integrate into the Security Folder team, given the several years of experience I accumulated in the prosecutor, in the commissioner against corruption, as well as cooperation with colleagues, ”he added.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>New Law of Foreigners increases racism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/nova-lei-dos-estrangeiros-aumenta-o-racismo/</link><description>Racism is increasingly an unfortunate reality in Portugal. It is enough to give you an example: in a classroom full of boys and white girls there was a black student, Kikas. The teacher asked the students what they had enjoyed most so far in life. Everyone answered and when Kikas commented on what he had liked most, he stressed that it had been the return to the world he had given. The teacher shouted him, calling him "liar !!!". Kikas replied that he did not accept the offense and informed the teacher that he was a adoptive son of a very rich white family and had been walking around the world with his parents. Not satisfied, the teacher stressed, "Shut up! Types like you always end up on the street!" And he told him to leave the room giving him disciplinary lack. This is one of the many most deplorable examples of racist attitudes in our society.
Last week, the AD/arrival alliance approved in the Assembly of the Republic a new law of foreigners. Criticism has been more than many, fundamentally because this law could increase racism in Portugal. Those who immediately came to Terreiro was the organization SOS racism that opposed the new law of immigrants, considering it a setback in protecting the guarantees of fundamental rights and freedoms, by altering the conditions of residence and obtaining citizenship directed to immigrants, including CPLP citizens. According to Mariana Carneiro, director of SOS Racism, the approval of the law with the support of the radical right represents a violation of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic and the European Conventions of Human Rights, as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The SOS Racism leader has even denounced that immigration has been treated as a crime, which unfortunately is not new, because Portugal has been walking this path for a long time. Mariana Carneiro said that the government, sworn in March 2024, had already adopted an increasingly aligned stance with the far right yielding to racist and xenophobic principles present in Portuguese society. For the director of SOS Racism, the new law is a blatant attack on people who choose to live and work in our country, while Gold visas receive privileged treatment, when simultaneously increasingly restrictive immigration policies applied to other immigrants are implemented.
The clamorous lead by the constitutional court of the initial version of the law on foreign residence authorization and family regrouping was a precious opportunity given by the President of the Republic to the Government to correct the shot in matters that are a test to humanistic values, defense of family principles and a privileged relationship with Lusophone countries. The solution found by AD and arrives is a legal tracery to circumvent the arguments of the Constitutional Court by maintaining all the political inconveniences of the initial version. It maintains as a rule of two years to request the family regrouping, from the granting of residence authorization and not of its request with the proof of payment of taxes and contributions to Social Security, despite the exceptions of reduction for one year when there are minor children.
The disappearance of the special regime for citizens of CPLP countries is confirmed. Denying the propagated preference for Lusophony and violating our commitments on mobility within the Lusophone space. On the other hand, we are surprised to maintain the privilege in access to family regrouping for Gold Visa, Blue Card European visas or to individuals considered highly qualified, favoring the performance of the origin or integration into Portuguese society. The proof of detention of conditions of condition and subsistence means continues to be fixed by ordinance with manifest violation of the principle of the reserve of law in fundamental rights. But all these limitations can be exceeded by ministerial order which is the open door to unlimited discretion and lack of transparency. There is a broad possibility of extension up to 18 months of the period of assessment of the request for family regrouping, as well as the possibility of appealing the courts to summon AIMA to comply with decision deadlines that continues to be strongly limited.
To get the idea of ​​the evil intentions of the law, of course issues such as the aggravated penalty of those who violate the work rights of foreign workers, the effective control of irregular immigration penalizing traffickers and employees or employer responsibility for the condition of seasonal workers are absolutely ignored matters. The same is true of the rules on access to learning the Portuguese language.
In conclusion, we can see that the new law of foreigners meet the arrival of the arrival racists and that immigrants are the most significant target to be increasingly harmed, giving strength to neo-fascists to continue treating immigrants as trash to throw them out of Portugal and this is pure racism.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:39:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Between Hyperion and Extinct Peace - Part 2</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/entre-hyperion-e-paz-extinta-2a-parte/</link><description>(Continuation of the September 26th edition)
“Peace Cannot Be Kept By Force; It Can Only Be Achieded by Understanding.”
Albert Einstein
The North is entirely shared by meridians between Russia, China and the United States. Three empires without continuity solution. Never have the maximum powers have been all adjusted. Never like now the sparks generated by reciprocal frictions can set the planet on fire. Ordolândia is overwhelming as Caosland expands to the northeast. Long -term scholars will notice that the Hot Peace Zone, the true name of the Cold War corresponds to the plimylness ecuma of the empires, that of the conflicts armed in (ex?) Colonies. According to geostrategic stenography, we find that Global North continues to dedicate itself to its favorite sport to discharge the rivalries between empires, through real or presumed clients, agile in changing acronyms and flag as needed. Austral massacres are endemic because they can only be resolved by boreals. Which have other priorities. When they do not dedicate themselves to keeping or expanding them as wars by power of attorney. The geopolitical economy of the reproduction of self -delighted peripheral outbreaks and/or directed externally would reveal altars that no actor is interested in exposing. An example among many is piracy cycles in the horn of Africa, encouraged by Americans to block to China access to hydrocarbons spread between Yemen and Somalia.
We rise to the imperial latitudes to verify the state of the supreme triangle. The competition between the United States, China and Russia, in order of value, paradoxically involves three subjects of contingent health. Close to the wearable pain threshold without soothing each other. What is the game today? We are still in time to avoid the threat of fair self -proclaimed peace by the single winner, if it will exist? Minerva's owl has not yet raised flight. Too much short -time turns and dilated spaces announce others, equally unforeseen. The limits to impure commitments are reduced. While the advertising obsessions of advertisements activate in the unpublished West totalitarian tics. Truths admit it in a low voice, with their hand in front of the mouth. In the temples of free American universities to the head with politically correct, censorship and self -censorship mimic Soviet neuroses. The dead devour the living. The challenge is asymmetrical. As for global potential, the United States maintain a decreasing advantage over China. Both distance themselves from Russia. But they are simplified static quantifications, while history accelerates geometrically. There is no mechanics or theology that emancipate in the calculation of probabilities.
Common sense, trivialized by national mainstream, dull or omits deep factors. Five examples. First; Strength relationships are subject to the whims of intransitive cultures. Americans, Chinese and Russians believe they understand themselves but cannot. They are heirs of proud civilizations, bearers of deeply rooted cultural codes, often indecipherable to those who observe them from the outside. When one reads where the other writes Z, the risk of involuntary war is approaching precisely the most difficult to avoid, because not foreseen. The interval between Russian and American reasoning is relatively narrow, allowing them to manage tensions such as those unfolding in Ukraine. Already in the Indo-Pacific, the degree of misunderstanding between the United States and China is more pronounced, which makes any incident potentially more dangerous, requiring extra prudence and effective channels of communication. As for the relationship between Russia and China, the distance between their symbolic universes is recognized by both, which leads them to privilege pragmatic cooperation, supported by convergent interests and mutual respect. The expression “boundless friendship” must be understood as a diplomatic formula that celebrates this approach, without intending to erase the differences that enrich each civilization. It is important to remember that slogans and appearances can be misleading.
Contemporary geopolitics is marked by complex overlays, where today's ally may be tomorrow's competitor, and vice versa. The simplifying narrative that opposes democracies to autocracies ignores the multiple forms of political organization and the historical contexts that shape each society. It is more productive to abandon such dichotomies and recognize that Western models also face internal contradictions that challenge any pretense of universality. We find that Russia and China have two distinct, more popular regime models in its countries than Trump and several European democracies leaders. Today, the Russian Federation and the Popular Republic of China, separated and connected by 4,209 kilometers of Siberian border along the Amur River, maintain a complex and historically dense relationship. They are strategic neighbors that, aware of their civilizational differences and distinct interests, opt for a prudent and mutually advantageous collaboration. This approach is also a way to prevent third parties from exploring any differences, fostering artificial tensions between two fundamental poles of euro-Asian stability.
Third; Washington and Beijing are undoubtedly first -rate powers, capable of acting anywhere and in all strategic dimensions from marine backgrounds to space, from earth to air and cyberspace to artificial intelligence. Moscow is only a great cultural, military-nuclear, energy and agricultural power, but limited by demographic and geopolitical constraints that feed their anxiety of being crushed between NATO and the center's empire. There is, however, a powerful indicator who plays in his favor in this triangular background race that is social cohesion. Expressed in patriotism that still sustains the Ukrainian adventure promoted by Putin, even against influential mechanisms, many of which they ignored until the last moment their risk. They criticized him discreetly in the early months of the war, because they underestimated the national spirit of the Russian people often superior to their own, more professional than spontaneous. Room; If we set free from the economic illusionism that idolizes GDP as a measure of all things, and evaluated the power relations between geopolitical subjects from the degree of social cohesion, we would discover the United States in third place well behind Russia and China.
French anthropologist Emmanuel Todd diagnoses the United States as a defeated and nihilistic oligarchy stating that “its dependence on the rest of the world has become immense and its society is disintegrating. The two phenomena interact ». There are nations without empire. But not empires without nation. And never nations without society. Today, America is an oligarchy intoxicated by the richness of the few, which are reflected in absolute poverty and the relative deprivation of the "deplorable." And they are confirmed in faith that "there is no such thing as a society" (Margaret Thatcher). Perhaps it is by the zero degree reached by the American Creed, a Protestant Anglo-Saxon Religion fragmented in neo-evangelical shrapnel centered on the special self-(for this order) relationship, excited by unlikely teleprife. Source of solipsism, fragmentation of families and communities, violence without values, depression aggravated by opiates, loss of common sense and, therefore, of reality. Perhaps also due to the social consequences of neoliberalism, which reduce citizens to clients, institutions to companies, government to “governance” and people to human resources.
Abyss of the degenerate elite and zénitis of the super class Manager, caste that surrounds the decision makers in their automatic technicism and living absence of spirit. It remains to be seen how a great empire may be again removed from national references and withdrawn without strategic within the American fortress, while dance and wants to dance to the rhythm of the fun whims of his shrink. Fifth; The competition in the triangle, triggered by the American crisis, shuffles the hierarchy of the powers. Average powers are assumed as maximum averages, while conceiving super maxims for the future. In front of all, the neo-imperial Türkiye, on a transcontinental scale. Others, such as Japan and even Germany in nervous crisis, focus on less large areas. They take advantage of the American retreat to expand in their respective regions as priority partners of today's “number one” because tomorrow will be another day. The Japanese and Germans offer to the United States to contain the visible Chinese expansion in Asia and the alleged Russian invasion of the European NATO, scheduled for 2029 according to Atlantic Communication.
Japanese rearmament continues discreetly, the German in Ostinating Rhetoric still far from completing in practice to the point of proposing as the first continental military power in the next decade. Without humor, European leaders seem to imitate the eve of the double war. Macron and Carlos III rediscover the anti-Germanic “Cordiale” 1904, promoted as “friendly”. With extended hand to the Poles, committed to restoring the thoughts of Marshal Piłsudeski. And with the thumb facing the Russians. Symptoms of emergency hysteria that circulates among Europeans do not know how much staged and accredited. In any case, the European bluff has been unmasked. Replaces it alarmism. In the strict sense it goes to weapons. The Cossacos arrive. Thus discouraged, do we return to the central question of how to neutralize, through dirty peace, the threat of total war, with unified war focuses? While utopists do not produce the general plan of universal just peace, we advance with the modest means at our disposal. We start over for the negotiated peace.
A bubble of informal indulgence among duelists reassured by its refined ambiguity. Inspiration of reasoning about the order of chaos. In his treadmill, a hierarchy of conflicts, and therefore of urgency to treat them. The classification is based on the likelihood of a strategic confrontation below the United States's warlord against China or two regional conflicts ongoing Russia against Ukraine and Israel against Iran (in apparent pause), Palestinians, and other neighbors trigger World War. Expected to involve the three vertices of the triangle. Dragging ourselves, fragile hinge between order and chaos. As a basis of discussion, we invented a coefficient of war dilation, borrowed from thermodynamics. Subjective measure that invites to refutation. On a scale of 1 to 10, we place first, with a 7, the Indo-Pacific-centered Sino-American duel. Just behind, Ukraine, with grade 6. Third, the war of Israel, not above 3.</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 02:17:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Artificial intelligence at the service of suicide (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/30/inteligencia-artificial-ao-servico-do-suicidio-ii/</link><description>Last week, we talked about a Californian couple who sued OpenAi technology company and its executive director Sam Altman for having artificial intelligence generator chatbot, supplied information and encouraged his 16 -year -old son Ryan to commit suicide. This case is not complex, but the legal, ethical and technological issues that raise are worthy of broad reflection.
Although Ryan's parents have moved an action against OpenAi and and against its executive director Sam Altman, we are facing a civil process and not a crime process. The reason is simple: it is a recent technology and currently lacks legal regulation. If the incentive to suicide is a crime, then it must be convicted. However, there is currently no law that provides for the possibility of this incentive from artificial intelligence platforms, thus making it impossible to criminal actions.
The situation is similar to civil processes. Since there is no law that stipulates that AI -induced suicide is illegal, Ryan's parents could only file a legal action for “responsibility for the product” based on the allegation of “defective product”. The success of the process will depend on California courts to accept legal argument.
From an ethical point of view, Altman stated that OpenAi was trying to find ways to notify competent government agencies if a smaller future was seriously discussed with ChatgPT suicide -related issues and the company could not contact parents. However, this method should not advance because it goes against the Privacy Protection Company policy. He also stated that ChatgPT should not support or contest anything, which means he should not take a position.
From a technological point of view, AI is unable to understand the complexities of human thought. For example, if one person tells another; The next time we meet, we had a tea; AI just interprets as; In the future, at any time, two people will have tea. However, if these words are just an act of courtesy, and in fact the one who wrote them has no intention of reviewing the other, there is a psychological complexity that is out of the reach of the current AI technology. When AI cannot understand the true meaning of a sentence, how can users interpret their answers?
After considering legal, ethical and technological issues, what measures can we actually take to solve the problems raised by AI?
ChatgPT, originally from the United States, is expected to be governed by US law. In response to the Ryan case, we hope this country considers the rapid adoption of laws that regulate the civil and criminal responsibility of those who use the AI ​​for illegal purposes.
ChatgPT users are scattered around the world. By implementing laws regulating the sector, the US should allow users from other countries to resort to US courts for compensation or to move actions similar to that of Ryan's parents. Imagine a British user who confronts himself with a similar situation. If the United Kingdom has no specific legislation, the minor's parents have no choice but to move the process in the US. Only appropriate legal protection can users around the world continue to access with confidence to chatgPT.
If a company that manages chatgPT finds that a minor is morbidly interested in suicide and cannot contact his parents, but does not care about the police for privacy protection, does that mean that privacy has more value than life? How can the company choose between protecting privacy and save a life? Should you violate privacy to save a life, or should you close your eyes on potential suicide and protect privacy?
The ethical questions are anyway; No choice is easy. If the right to privacy and the right to life are incompatible, can ChatgPT ignore certain questions merely not to answer? Or you may simply give an answer, "this question may be illegal, so I refuse to answer. The user must consult a lawyer before deciding whether to proceed."
The Ryan case is just the beginning of the problems with AI. The more implanted this technology is, the more questions will arise. More unexpected and bizarre things will be revealed in the future. In addition to developing technology and improving AI quality, manufacturers should also make efforts to constantly remember employees of their social responsibilities, the importance of business ethics and the need for products to meet security standards. AI companies can take the initiative to conduct “ethics audits” with external auditors during annual financial audits to assess whether employees are up to business ethical standards and whether the company's ethical awareness is sufficient. This procedure would give users a lot of tranquility.
Promotion and education are essential for users to correctly understand AI. If they realize that AI is just a computerized method of disseminating information, devoid of any human emotions, they will naturally be less inclined to trust their answers and the number of complicated cases will decrease.
Only by fully understanding AI limitations and continuously betting on improvement can we maximize its benefits.

Much has been built, but have been luxury or real estate condominiums that only the upper or high average classes can acquire. The normal worker, who lives from a salary of approximately 1000 and 1500 euros, can never think of buying home. A young man, not even dreaming.
It is no coincidence that Portugal is the country of Europe where children are living more years in their parents' homes. Even the public or social dwellings that have been built in the last decade, some being part of buildings with fourteen floors, are completely abandoned. There are buildings in social neighborhoods with ten and more floors that have had damaged elevators for over two years for lack of maintenance and many seniors have not left home for over a thousand days.
In large cities we can observe thousands of houses that are closed. Some, by litigation between heirs. Others, simply because the owner has more than a property and does not want to sell or lease. The government should decree the prohibition of a home ended for more than three months. Only on an avenue of Lisbon we counted about 200 homes of blinds down and without living someone.
However, this chronicle is dedicated to Luís Montenegro who owns, imagine, of 55 houses. Consequently an inquiry in the Public Prosecution Service (MP) over the case. This, after the “scolding” we watched with his “familiar” company that received hundreds of thousands of euros from potential clients receiving award from the Montenegro government. According to a source of the MP, everything can happen to Montenegro. If serious irregularities and acts of corruption are proven, the Prime Minister will obviously have to resign. And in this case, an advisor to a government ministry, he said that Ministers Leitão Amaro and Paulo Rangel would be prepared to assume the position of Chief Executive.
55 houses belonging to Luís Montenegro is surprising and offensive to all Portuguese who cannot buy a house, who live in tents or who are homeless. The clarification has to be fully and the prime minister last week received from the MP a request for more documentation on the preventive investigation that takes place on its unlavod properties and the activity of its “family” spinumviva company.
The most shocking on the part of the politician who heads the Portuguese Government arrested with its ban on public access to the number of the matrix of the 55 properties that declared to the entity for transparency. Montenegro submitted to this organism an opposition request for the disclosure of the number of the headquarters of the buildings, and the entity concerned the request of the head of the Government.
The prime minister declared six urban properties, including the “famous” luxurious house of Espinho, which has five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and garage, an apartment in Lisbon, 46 rustic buildings, which he said he inherited from his family. Asked by journalists about the requested ban, the prime minister's office did not respond. What, and why, Montenegro hides what you have from real estate? Fearful that it is discovered that your acquisition was not lawful?
The Prime Minister, who holds so many properties, has to know what young people suffer who cannot have a housing or what the university students spend on organized mobster groups. A daughter of a friend of ours gave us that she lived in Lisbon in a room with another colleague and paid 600 euros a month. We didn't believe it and went to confirm.
- Good afternoon, my lady!
- Good afternoon…
- Do you have any room to lease?
- No, I don't have… well, I mean…
- I mean… how?
-If you are willing to pay a room where two people sleep, I arrange a…
- Like this? Do two people sleep in each room?
- Yes!
- And are they friends?
- Many times, no!
- And how many rooms do you have?
- I have seven, with three bathrooms…
- I mean, there are seven rooms, each with two people and not everyone has a private bathroom…
- No…
- And who lives in the rooms?
- They are university students… boys and girls…
- And how much does each one pay?
- The monthly price is 600 euros…
- Sorry, 600 euros for the bedroom, 300 each, is that it?
- No no! Each one, pays 600 euros and if you want a room you have to pay 1200 euros…
-Sorry, but I don't see the movie well… you have seven bedrooms, each yields you a month 1200 euros, which makes a monthly total of 8,400 euros… and passes receipt?
- Don't even think!
"So you get 8,400 euros a month and still escape the tax authorities?"
- Sorry, I'm going to close the door because I don't know who you are, with so many questions… this is not pleasing me… What does you do?
- I'm a journalist ...

Persona Non Grata Pictures stressed that the feature film was recognized by the festival's official jury "for the originality and subtlety with which the argument addresses aging questions." The argument was written by the director himself and co-argumentista Tiago Cravidão, said the producer in a statement.
"This is a movie about empathy, about learning to see each other, through dialogue, not as a threat, but as someone like us, has desires and aspirations similar to ours, however different we appear to be," said António Ferreira, during the awards ceremony.
The Tangier Film Festival took place from October 1st to 4th. “The Memory of the Smell of Things” debuts in Portuguese theaters on November 6th. The film had already won, in June, the best actor of the Shanghai International Film Festival in East of China, for José Martins.
In the end, José Martins plays “a forced colonial war veteran to enter a nursing home, where he faces the ghosts of his past and forms an unexpected bond with his black caregiver,” according to the synopsis.
The film, a Portugal-Brazil co-production, presents itself as “a poetic and intimate portrait of an elderly manner in an institution, exploring the fragility of human condition, the inevitability of death and the search for redemption”, works “pressing issues of society, such as population aging and structural racism.”</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:41:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Opera | Bizet's “Carmen”, presented today at CCM</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/opera-carmen-de-bizet-apresentada-hoje-no-ccm/</link><description>Today begins the Macao International Music Festival (FINAM) with a show that has long been part of the international panorama: the opera “Carmen”, which performs in “Carmen - Opera in four acts of Georges Bizet”. The stage is the large auditorium of the Macao Cultural Center (CCM), with the beginning of the show scheduled for 7:30 pm.
The production is in charge of Opéra Comic and the Zurich Opera, with staging of Andreas Homoki. This show takes place in partnership with the Macau Orchestra, and the collaborations of the China National Symphony Orchestra and Macao Youth Choir.
“Let's dive into a world of burning passion.” This is the reputed left in the official show of the show, marked by a "dramatic involvement and unforgettable music".
On the CCM stage is “an inventive production”, with “pulsating arias and inspired by Spanish musical exoticism and timeless themes”. With this adaptation of the “Bizet masterpiece”, “Carmen” remains “today as powerful and relevant as when it was created”.
“Taken to the scene by reward Andreas Homoki, the production transports the plot to an austere and metal scenario. An replica of the Opera Como Page becomes the background of a time trip, where each act suggests a different era: from Paris da Belle Époque to World War II and, finally, to the present”, describes the program.
"Carmen" thus captures "like never the crude and dramatic emotion of the classic, reinterpreting themes that emerge the destiny and humanity of a subtle and at the same time bold."
According to the program, this show can be enjoyed by "melómanos or novice spectators", because "this production involves and challenges us, remaining with us much after the show is over." We are thus before "an extraordinary demonstration of music, tragedy and seduction."</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 02:22:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Lusophony Festival | Calema and Marisa Liz act in the Houses Museum of Taipa</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/festival-da-lusofonia-calema-e-marisa-liz-actuam-nas-casas-museu-da-taipa/</link><description>This year's Lusophony Festival program is already known, which will be held between October 24 and November 2, integrated at the 7th Meeting in Macau - Art and Culture Festival between China and Portuguese -speaking countries.

A bright gold clock and a gold ring with a large undead jade stone immediately attract the look to the left hand. The right hand is equally adorned, with a gold dragon ring wrapped in the index finger and a gigantic ruby ​​giggle to the ring finger. A wooden beads surrounds the right wrist, adding the finishing touch to the whole. Alexander Leong's legacy began in 1940, when the family owned eight holders in Hong Kong.
At that time, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the pledge houses lived a boom, fed by refugees who fled to Hong Kong and Macau in serious difficulties. “People pledged shoes, comforters and clothes in my grandfather's time,” Leong told Lusa.
After 70 years in the stronghold of players, the store moved to a neighborhood inhabited by migrant workers. The change has led the Leong business to have as main customers workers from Southeast Asia countries, which meant "significantly lower profits."
“A player customer is equivalent to 30 or 50 local or migrant workers,” he estimated, stressing that these workers often pledged jewelry for liquidity after sending most salaries to home countries. Still, Alexander Leong does not regret change. "Good thing we moved. If we had not done it, it would have been terrible," said the businessman, who is also president of the Fiscal Council of the Macao Stress Traders Association.
The power of the game
The Leong family witnessed the entire cycle of expansion and contraction of the Macao pledge industry, a sector intrinsically linked to the casino business.
Shortly after the liberalization of the game in 2003, Alexander says, the number of pledge houses in Macao “increased dramatically” when compared to the period even before the transfer of sovereignty from the territory to China in December 1999. “Macau had not been over 40 or 50 establishments,” he said.
“In the moments of peak of activity, around 2014, there were more than 200 pledge houses,” he said. This number fell, however, significantly, today is only 56, a number that has not been seen since the period prior to 1999, and the descent has not yet stained, given the new challenges that are announced.
The decline began in 2019. "The massive protests in Hong Kong impacted our industry in Macao. The [Chinese] tourists of the continent were afraid to come to Hong Kong and, as Macau is neighboring, they didn't travel here either," explained the attachment.
"Then, when the pandemic arrived, the business fell to the pike," he continued. After the end of borders, many pledge businesses, which previously operated 24 hours a day, had only daytime. "This forced the closing of numerous houses," he added.
The most recent challenge now arises, with the end of the satellite casinos by the end of the year, and the crisis in the sector “will deepen even more,” says Alexander Leong.
He feels that the sector has been "marginalized by the authorities, who consider the seils a" high risk "business for money laundering." However, he argues, although the Macao game industry is considered nuclear, "the pledge houses have served a mutually beneficial purpose, themselves and the rulers for centuries."
The pledge houses are a vital part of the ecosystem, said the associative leader, as a message: “not only generate tax revenue for the government and value the city that never sleeps, but also provide additional employment opportunities to Macao residents.”</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:42:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Zhuhai | About 70 families of Macao affected by center closing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/zhuhai-cerca-de-70-familias-de-macau-afectadas-por-encerramento-de-centro/</link><description>A Zhuhai Basketball Academy closed, leaving about 70 families from Macao to ask for the reimbursement for the payment of registrations. The case was presented at a press conference marked by the Alliance of the People's Alliance of Macao Institution.
During the event, a group of parents affected by the closing, which were without the money paid, exposed the situation. According to those affected, the Basketball Academy had been operating for about six years, so it was considered by families as a credible institution. The closing was thus a shock to everyone. About 70 families will have paid more than 400,000 Renminbis, which gives an average of 5,714 Renminbis for family.
The closing took place on September 24, but parents criticized the attitude of the institution, because since June 18 that had ongoing a promotion with cheaper registrations, in the case of the first children's registration or simply renewal. According to the contours presented, three days from the close of the gym were still being accepted registration.
With families complaining about the closure, the Zhuhai authorities organized a meeting between their parents and those responsible for the gym. However, the meeting promoted by the authorities on the other side of the border was inconsequential, in the protection of the rights of Macao residents. Of the meeting, did not result any agreement or solution.
Parents also criticized the gym, because despite working six years ago they had no license from the Interior Education Department, as would be expected. Macao's 70 families are part of the 2,000 families affected by Zhuhai's latest scandal.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:20:29</pubDate></item><item><title>CCAC | Subcommittee suspected of abuse of power</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/ccac-subcomissario-suspeito-de-abuso-de-poder/</link><description>The suspect will have used the job to cross hundreds of times the family border when he was not working through an internal channel for employees
A subcommittee of the Public Security Police (CPSP) is being investigated for the crime of abuse of power. At question is that the agent has used his powers to cross the border, often accompanied by the family, by the workers' internal channels, in order to avoid complications of normal channels for residents and tourists.
The information was released on Friday by the Commissioner Against Corruption (CCAC), who points out that the subcommittee is "suspected of abusing his power, several times" to "enter his family in Macao through the migration post that was under his command."
In addition to using with the family the internal channels for employees, the CCAC indicates that the subcommittee also required "its subordinates to deal with the formalities of passage at the borders, in order to circumvent normal procedures of customs control at the border post."
The situation of illegal tickets lasted about four years, between 2020 and 2024, with the subcommittee to "take advantage of his police identification card to access the interdict's interdict employees, where formalities concerned the border passage." "In addition, when entry into the sons, it avoided passing through the customs inspection zone, ignoring the customs inspection formalities, the measures of migration control and the order of the border passage of the masters," was revealed.
Case in the Public Prosecution Service
"This subcommittee is suspected of the crime of abuse of power foreseen and punished by the Penal Code, and the case was sent to the Public Prosecution Service and communicated to CPSP," was disclosed. The crime of abuse of power is provided for in Article 347 of the Penal Code and provides for a three -year prison sentence, which may also be a fine. It is a crime that implies showing that the agent has benefited from conduct or causing damage.
With the press release on which it revealed the case, the CCAC called on agents to be strict and have no expectations of being able to violate the law without being caught. "The CCAC reiterates that civil service workers, particularly agents of authority, should be more strict in their self-discipline and should not challenge the law, hoping not to be caught," he was reported.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:18:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Legend | Almost 87 billion with issuance of actions expected</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/macau-legend-esperados-quase-87-mil-milhoes-com-emissao-de-accoes/</link><description>Macao Legend Development has reported to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange the decision to issue subscription to the right to obtain capital, expected, according to a $ 93 billion of Hong Kong's $ 93 billion with the issuance of 310,059,356 rights shares.

It is the highest amount since tickets started to be paid. Compared to September last year, the number of passengers more than doubled
Macau's light meter registered an average of about 30,600 passengers per day in September, the highest number since the transportation began to charge tariffs, the operator said on Friday. According to official data, the Macao Metro Society of Metro, the average passenger increased by 10.9 percent compared to August, and more that doubled compared to the same month of 2024.
The light meter was inaugurated on December 10, 2019 and this month continues to stop the record, with a daily average of 33,000 passengers. At that time, trips were free as a way to start the start of operations of this means of transport.
In February 2020, with the start of tariff collection and the detection of the first cases of infection by the new coronavirus in Macao, the daily average passenger fell to 1,100. The light meter would record this minimum amount in July 2022, the month when the city was in confinement for two weeks due to an outbreak of COVID-19.
Mountain connection
In December, the length of the slight surface meter that connects Macau is operated to the neighboring mountain island, with 2.2 kilometers.
A month earlier, the line that goes to Seac Pai Van was inaugurated, a neighborhood of Colaane where the government built 60,000 public housing apartments. The light meter ripped with only one line, which was circulating only on Taipa Island, with a length of 9.3 kilometers and 11 stations, with a frequency of 10 to 15 minutes for almost 17 hours per day.
The connection from the subway to Barra, in the south of the Macao Peninsula, through the lower floor of the SAI Van Bridge, began operating in December 2023.
With the extent of the light meter, the authorities predict that the passenger volume reaches 137,000 people a day in 2030. The government launched at the end of 2022 the contests for the design and construction of the eastern east line, which will connect north of the Macao Peninsula, where the main border with mainland China is located.
On Wednesday, Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam Vai Man, said the government is planning the extension of the light meter with the construction of the West Line, which will pass through the inner port.
This neighborhood is regularly affected by floods. On this aspect, Raymond Tam stressed that "it is necessary to consider and proceed with a planning and study of a number of factors that integrate flood prevention infrastructures, peripheral streets, planning and landscaping." The light meter has suffered significant financial skids as well as in the execution deadlines. The first line, promised for over a decade, cost 10.2 billion patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:16:28</pubDate></item><item><title>MATMO | Fourth typhoon in five weeks caused a wound</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/matmo-quarto-tufao-em-cinco-semanas-causou-um-ferido/</link><description>Typon signal 8 was aveiled for about 11 hours, between 2am and 1pm yesterday. In addition to a wounded, the fall of a bamboo scaffold from the Dª Building. Juliet Nobre de Carvalho led several roads to be closed
Typhoon Matmo rose over 300 kilometers from Macao, but caused a wounded and the fall of a scaffold at Toi San forced some public roads to be closed. These were two of the nine occurrences recorded by the Civil Protection Operations Center (COPC) during that which was the fourth typhoon to affect the territory in five weeks and which led to signal 8 of typhoons to be raised for about 11 hours, between 02h and 13h.
The details about the injuries caused to a citizen were not revealed, but the occurrence was declared to COPC for health services and the Kiang Wu Hospital, where the person was treated.
Typhoon's passage was also marked by the fall of a bamboo scaffold on the Dª building facade. Juliet noble of Carvalho. The occurrence caused the viaduct in front of this building to be temporarily ended.
As a consequence, a section of a Nova de Toi San Street was also temporarily closed, the connection of the intersection between Artur Tamagnini Barbosa Avenue and Conselheiro Borja Avenue, until the intersection between Artur Tamagnini Barbosa Avenue and Pow Chon Street. Among the closed roads was also the section of the intersection between Artur Tamagnini Barbosa Avenue and Central Street of Toi San until the intersection between the isthmus of Ferreira do Amaral and Central Street of Toi San.
The fall of the scaffold was included in official data on occurrences during the typhoon, with the authorities to record a total of three cases of scaffolding or objects in fallen shipyards, or that threatened to fall, to public roads.
However, the largest number of occurrences were related to the removal of plaster, complaints, windows, awnings or other objects at risk of falling, with seven occurrences. There were also three cases of removal of buildings, lamps or trees at risk of falling or overthrowing.
The passage of the maturity also led to nine people to resort to the emergency reception centers provided by the Institute of Social Action (IAS).
Never seen
The latest typhoon to affect the territory was equally marked by a debut. For the first time since the Macau Bridge was inaugurated, he remained open to traffic, although the number 8 sign of typhoon was lifted.
The announcement that the central bridge board would remain open with signal 8 of typhoon was released on Friday through the official bulletin. The speed of the crossing in case of typhoon is limited to 60 kilometers per hours.
With this infrastructure open to traffic, drivers have another alternative to circulate between Macao and the mud in case of typhoon. In addition to the Macao bridge, it is equally possible to circulate on the bottom tray of the SAI van bridge. Regarding transportation, the Macao Civil Aviation Authority (AACM) revealed that 51 flights were affected by Typhoon, with 18 to be canceled, 26 to delays and seven to change at times.
Explanations and records
With signal number 8 of typhoon to be replaced, the authorities issued a statement to justify that the distance is not the only reason for the highest signs.
"In general terms, the more intense winds are in the vicinity of the center of a tropical storm. Thus, the closer to the center, the more likely to register strong winds (equivalent to a signal 8) or even more intense," he was explained. "However, in fact, the intensity of the wind generated by a tropical storm is influenced by several factors, including the structure of circulation, the interaction between weather systems and the differences in the wind direction," he was added.
On the maturity, it was indicated that the “wide extent of the strong winds was sufficient to affect the region” and that the “intense gusts associated with rain bands resulted in winds that, during signal 8, continued to reach or exceed level 8 in open areas and bridges”. "Thus, the distance cannot be the only criterion to be considered to determine the need to issue typhoon signs," he was stressed.
The SMG also reported that this was the 12th tropical storm affecting Macau this year, a record that only parallel in 1974. These storms made signal 8 for the fourth time in the same year, which had only happened in 1993, 2008 and 2022.
Denial floods
Yesterday, Full Images circulated on social networks in the Patane area. However, the authorities issued a statement to indicate that the images were raised during Typhoon Ragasa, who passed Macau last month. “Regarding an online video that alleges serious flooding in the Patane zone, CPSP confirmed at the site that there are no floods right now. This video was filmed during the passage of the tropical storm Ragasa, which recently hit Macau.
The COPC calls on the public to avoid creating and spreading rumors, as such acts can be a crime, ”was appealed.“ The COPC is continuously monitoring the city's situation and clarifies that small floods have been checked in the interior port area, which have already retreated, ”was added.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:14:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Hospitality | Average occupancy rate of 93 percent in August</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/hotelaria-taxa-de-ocupacao-media-de-93-por-cento-em-agosto/</link><description>Macao hotels received more than 1.3 million guests to August, registering an average occupancy rate of 92.9 percent, according to data released by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) last Tuesday.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.
 
10/28/22
In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my rank of hatter at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

The PLD-a party leading the government-may have lost the absolute majority in both parliament chambers this year, but opposition seems too fragmented to prevent Takaichi from being elected Prime Minister in the coming days, in October 13, according to local media.
Sanae Takaichi, 64, will succeed Shigeru Ishiba, who was elected head of government in October 2024 and resigned last month. In the second scrutiny, which took place Saturday and in which only the elected representatives and PLD members were voted, Sanae Takaichi surpassed agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, 44.
Takaichi will have to ensure that the PLD -a right -wing nationalist party in power almost uninterrupted since 1955, but now increasingly rejected by voters -recovers part of his ancient glory. "With all you, we opened a new era for the PLD," said the new leader to his peers a few minutes after his election.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:37:07</pubDate></item><item><title>North Korea claims to have mobilized “special means” against South Korea</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/coreia-do-norte-afirma-ter-mobilizado-meios-especiais-contra-coreia-do-sul/</link><description>North Korea mobilized “special means” against South Korea, where approximately 28,500 US soldiers are highlighted, said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, quoted yesterday by the state press.
According to North Korea's official news agency, KCNA, the revelation took place on Saturday, in a speech given a gun exhibition in Pyongyang, but Kim did not disclose details about the "special means." "The nuclear alliance between the United States and South Korea is quickly progressing, and are conducting various types of exercises to test hazardous scenarios," said the North Korean leader.
"As US military personnel reinforce their arsenal in the South Korea region, our strategic concerns about this region also intensify and therefore allocated our special key resources," Kim said. The North Korean leader assured that he was “closely accompanied” the military developments across the border.
"The enemy (…) will have to worry about changes in his security environment," he said. Photos released by KCNA show Kim to walk in front of weapons, including a missile, surrounded by North Korean generals in an exhibition center.
Promises to fulfill
On September 22, the North Korean leader declared himself willing to resume dialogue with the United States if they fail to demand that Pyongyang abandon the nuclear weapons program. "If the United States abandon its delirious obsession with denuclearization and, recognizing reality, truly wish to coexist peacefully with us, then there is no reason that we cannot sit at the table with them," Kim said.
"I have good memories of the current US President Donald Trump," he added. North Korea performed six nuclear tests between 2006 and 2017 and has since continued to develop its arsenal despite heavy international sanctions. Pyongyang justifies its military nuclear program with the threats that it claims to be targeted by the United States and its allies, including South Korea.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:35:37</pubDate></item><item><title>WTO | Beijing asks Mexico to protect the interests of Chinese companies</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/omc-pequim-pede-ao-mexico-que-proteja-interesses-de-empresas-chinesas/</link><description>China has asked Mexico to comply with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules in its anti-dumping investigations and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, the Ministry of Commerce said on Friday. A ministry spokesman asked the observations in response to a press question about four Mexico anti-dumping investigations into Chinese products, including floating glass and PVC canvas, says Xinhua.
China is firmly opposed to protectionist measures that undermine its legitimate rights and interests and will closely monitor the development of investigations, said the spokesman. It was observed that this year, Mexico has opened 11 anti-dumping investigations on Chinese products so far-almost double the total of last year-while China continued to have moderation in the launch of trade defense investigations.
In the context of excessive use of tariffs by the United States, China advocates that all countries must work together to oppose unilateralism, contain the dissemination of protectionism and refrain from imposing restrictions on China under various pretexts due to external coercion, according to the spokesman.
In response to tariff increases and other restrictions proposed by Mexico, the ministry has launched an investigation into commercial and investment barriers according to relevant laws and regulations. "Based on our real discoveries and circumstances, China will take all the necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, including trade and investment measures," said the spokesman.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:34:14</pubDate></item><item><title>MATMO | Canceled Flights and Closed Stores</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/matmo-cancelados-voos-e-encerradas-lojas/</link><description>Chinese authorities canceled flights and ended Sabbath Stores, in anticipation of the Typhoon Matmo passage, which approached the provinces of Hainan and Guangdong in southern China.

Beijing continues to invest in strength in the technological development of the Lusophone country
China's growing investment in Brazil should boost local innovation and technology, benefiting the economy and generating new growth opportunities, according to an article in the China Daily newspaper. Data published this month by the Brazil-China Business Council (CEBC) revealed that Chinese investment in Brazil totaled $ 4.8 billion last year, more than double the amount recorded in 2023, the People's Diary indicates.
Uallace Moreira, Secretary of Industrial Development, Innovation, Commerce and Services of the Ministry of Development, Industry, Commerce and Services, said Brazil intends to channel capital to make the country a technology producer and an investor in partner economies.
The country considers this growth as very positive, in a partnership that has been expanding for over a decade, according to Moreira, adding that the sources of these investments are diversifying and that Brazil is now the fifth largest destination of foreign investment worldwide, which generates jobs and income.
Chinese investments throughout the Brazilian economy can stimulate gains in innovation and technology for local industry, said the official. According to Moreira, Brazil aims to expand its investments abroad and in various sectors already present in China, including coffee, proteins and food, cellulose and electrical equipment.
With these two strands - receive and make investments, Brazil is building synergy for an innovative ecosystem, creating research centers, sending Brazilians to China, expanding its learning curve and adding value to the country's production chain, he noted.
Other investments
However, private investors also welcomed the growth of Chinese investments. Ricardo Martins, chief economist at Planner Investimentos, from the São Paulo Stock Exchange Brokerage Agency, said the jumps in both directions were significant. China, as Brazil's main commercial partner in recent years, has been opening doors for higher commercial flows, he said.
This allows the diversification of markets, Martins pointed out, adding that opportunities in agriculture, renewable energy, infrastructure and aerospace projects are emerging from this increasingly close relationship. From soy, iron ore, meat to cars, doors were opened to 183 Brazilian companies that export to China, Martins indicated.
To last
In addition, a large amount of Chinese investments also went to the energy sector, noted the official. Only China's State Grid has invested about 5 billion since entering Brazil. Ramon Haddad, Vice President of State Grid Brazil Holding, said Brazil is part of the company's long-term strategy.
State Grid operates in 14 of the 27 states of Brazil, in addition to the Federal District. Its infrastructure provides about 10 percent of the country's electricity. Haddad reported that more projects-especially for ultra-high voltage transmission systems-are coming, with an estimated total investment of 3.5 billion planned for the next four years.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:31:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Earthquake / Philippines | New Balance points to 72 dead</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/sismo-filipinas-novo-balanco-aponta-para-72-mortos/</link><description>The death toll in the earthquake that hit the Philippines on Tuesday rose to 72, yesterday announced emergency services, which now focus on helping hundreds of injured and thousands of displaced.
Firefighters and rescue teams said they had removed the bodies of a woman and a child from the rubble of a hotel that collapsed in the city of Bogo, near the epicenter of the magnitude 6.9 earthquake on the Richter scale. The previous balance pointed to 69 deadly victims. The epicenter of the earthquake was located at sea, near the island of Cebu, in the central part of the archipelago, on Tuesday at 21:59, at local time, according to the United States geological service.
More than 300 secondary tremors have already reached the region, according to the Filipino Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology, slowing rescue efforts. The government reported that 294 people were injured and about 20,000 fled home, and almost 600 dwellings were destroyed in the north of Cebu Island, forcing many residents to sleep in the open.
Cebu province governor Pamela Baricuatro has launched an appeal for help for thousands of families needing drinking water, food, clothing and shelter. “Many houses have been destroyed and many families need help to recover… they need our help, our prayers and our support,” Baricuatro wrote on Facebook social network.
According to CEBU's civil protection, more than 110,000 people in 42 communities affected by the earthquake need assistance, especially to rebuild houses and recover subsistence means.

The remaining vessels of the flotilla, the smaller boats, continue to navigate, but it is almost certain that they will soon be intercepted, the spokesman added, in statements to the Spanish news agency EFE.
Delia also said that the location of the boat 'Mikeno', which was a few kilometers from the coast of Gaza was unknown when the video signal that had been activated during the trip disappeared. At this time, 22 Italians, including several deputies, are detained by Israel under the operation, but “are all well,” according to Italian Foreign Minister António Tajani.
According to the Ministry of Italian Foreign Affairs, the crews were taken to the Port of Ashdod and maintained in designated centers, where they can accept immediate voluntary expulsion or reject it and await a court decision. If the voluntary departure is rejected, "Flotilha members will have to await the decision of the judicial authorities about their expulsion, which usually takes 48 to 72 hours," the same source explained.
The government also mentioned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is following Israel's involvement in Flotilha and will offer consular assistance to detainees, as the Italy Embassy in Telavive is closely following the case and has already prepared a help program.
Detained Portuguese
Tajani has already informed the House of Representatives that 22 Italian citizens boarded in the 'global Sumud' flotilla were arrested by the Israeli authorities when they began to intercept the boats that led humanitarian aid to Gaza.
"According to my instructions, the consulate in Telavive and the General Consulate in Jerusalem will assist all Italians, both in Porto and in repatriation procedures," he said, adding that the Italians detained by Israel should be repatriated in a few days. "I repeatedly talked to Israel's Foreign Minister [Gideon] Sa'ar, installing him to avoid aggressive actions," he said.
"I am relieved to find that the rules of commitment have been respected and that so far there have been no acts of violence or complications in the operations of Israeli forces," he said, adding that "the first matches [of Israel] can happen on Friday, especially those who accept Israel voluntarily."
The vessels integrated in the flotilha were intercked by the Navy of Israel on Wednesday, one of which was ranked in international waters, according to the organization. Among the detainees are the coordinator of the Left Block, Mariana Mortágua, actress Sofia Aparício and activist Miguel Duarte.</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 02:21:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Asia | Chinese electric cars challenge Japanese rule</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/asia-carros-electricos-chineses-desafiam-dominio-japones/</link><description>Increasing sales of low-cost Chinese electric cars are shaking the domain of decades of Japanese brands in Southeast Asia, according to a study released Tuesday by the PWC consulting and audit firm.
The market share of Japanese manufacturers - led by Toyota, Honda and Nissan - fell to 62 percent of sales in the first half of 2025 in the six largest markets in the region, against an average of 77 percent over the past decade. Chinese producers increased their slice of almost null to more than 5 percent of 3.3 million units sold.
The Chinese offensive is explained by the price war that the sector faces in China, which led manufacturers to look for nearby external markets, benefiting from a regional trade agreement that guarantees access without tariffs. "The entry of Chinese Electric Vehicle Manufacturers marks the end of a Japanese era in Southeast Asia," said Patrick Ziechmann, PWC analyst in Malaysia.
In Indonesia, the largest consumer market in the region, Toyota's sales fell 12 percent between January and August, to 161,079 units, while those of Chinese Byd tripled to 18,989. Affordable prices are seen as a determining factor: Some Chinese models start at $ 12,000.
"The price is the decisive factor. The Japanese have to react, otherwise they will continue to lose market share," said the Vice President of the Indonesian Association of Automobile Manufacturers, Jongkie Sugiarto, quoted by the British newspaper Financial Times. The Chinese presence in the country is not limited to sales. At least 15 brands are already active and another five should come in soon.</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 02:12:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Middle East | China “supports all the efforts that lead to distension” between Palestine and Israel</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/03/medio-oriente-china-apoia-todos-os-esforcos-que-conduzam-a-distensao-entre-palestina-e-israel/</link><description>China has supported Tuesday support to "all efforts leading to the distension between Palestine and Israel," after US President Donald Trump present a plan to end the war in Gaza.
At a press conference, Chinese diplomacy spokesman Guo Jiakun called on the “serious” application of the UN resolutions, a “immediate and integral” ceasefire in Gaza, the liberation of all detainees and the relief of the “as soon as possible” humanitarian crisis.
The official reiterated that Beijing argues that “Palestinians govern Palestine” and the realization of the solution of “two states”. "We are willing to work with the international community to achieve a ready, comprehensive, fair and lasting solution to the Palestinian issue," he added.
The reaction comes after the White House made a 20-point plan on Monday that predicts ceasefire in the Israeli offensive, hostage release and the creation of a Gaza transition government supervised by a board presided by Trump himself.
The plan also includes the United States's commitment to mediate between Israelites and Palestinians to “a peaceful coexistence” and opens the door to the creation of a Palestinian state. Since the escalation of the conflict, China has condemned Israeli attacks and repeated support for the “two states” solution.</description><pubDate>2025-10-03 02:11:17</pubDate></item><item><title>Cuca Roseta, Fadista: “Fado is a samba-poetry sung from the heart”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/cuca-roseta-fadista-o-fado-e-um-samba-poesia-cantado-vindo-do-coracao/</link><description>In the pandemic sang to the audience of Macau through a videoConcerto, but now the fadista gives herself from soul and heart to a concert with the Chinese orchestra of Macau, integrated on the poster of the International Macao Music Festival, next Saturday, 11.

We now act with OCM, which is very good, and I am happy with this partnership, because I can somehow unite two cultures. We are a little eager for that fact.
The concert will have songs like “mine”, “black and white”, “Song of the Sea”, “I don't know where” and “finally”. What brings us this alignment?
We already had arrangements made for orchestra by Marinho de Freitas, which are extraordinary arrangements, and will be adapted to traditional OCM instruments. These songs are practically all of my authorship, lyrics and music, and tell different stories, some that I lived myself or stories that, somehow, I experienced someone living, very close. They are original fados. The “Song of the Sea” is very old and became known in the voice of Dulce Pontes and Amália Rodrigues, and has a new arrangement. We thought it would be beautiful with the OCM. Of course there are songs we always sing and do not leave the repertoire, linked to the traditional phases of my career. There are some songs that people like and ask, but we bring a completely different repertoire from what we present at the time [in Macao, with the VideoConcerto], which was very well received. It was a concert that went very well, although it was by video, and we received wonderful messages.
This year released the album “Even Faith Forgot”, which has an exclusively Brazilian repertoire, with several names of Brazilian music, such as Seu Jorge or Zeca Pagodinho. Why explore this universe by mixing it with the language of fado?
Yes, but this year I will also release a French album with the agent of Amália Rodrigues, who made me this invitation. But "even faith forgot" came from an invitation from a great Brazilian producer to record old sambas, and that have a lot to do with fado. Although it is a Brazilian album, all with sambas, it is my saddest album of all, more melancholy. Hence we went looking for this samba root to find great poets and great composers that Brazil has, and which have this weight that fado also has.
As?
Fado binds a lot to the word and composition, by the way, fado is a samba-poetry sung from the heart, because there must be this truth in interpretation, the idea of ​​the truth from life experiences, in transforming the story that tells. This melancholy is in the veins of Portuguese blood and is mixed with art and music. This invitation wanted to put a fado singer to sing seriously and with the weight that Fado brings, and being able to interpret the great poets and sambas. The album [even faith forgot] has very old sambas, one of them from 1937. It is, therefore, a very strong and even very beautiful album, with great poems and composers, such as Tom Jobim, Vinicius de Morais, and wonderful partnerships with his Jorge and Zeca Pagodinho, who came to Fado. It's an album that made me really proud.

So you can marry fado with the joy of samba, which also has a melancholy side, isn't it? Like the melancholy of our fado.
In fact, when we hear the word samba we think of joy, but in fact the base of samba is not joy. There is that phrase of Vinicius de Morais, "to make a samba with beauty it takes a bit of sadness, if not, no samba is done." So this is where the beauty of this work falls, which goes to the root of samba and shows that there are no such differences between the melancholy of the root of samba and the melancholy of fado. It is a nostalgic and melancholy album, it does not bring this joy. It can bring hope, and we can say that some themes bring with it this hope, which we find in Brazilian culture and in the drums. Because they literally put the sorrows on the wheel of skirt and drums, aren't they? They transform the sadness into dance and music, but in this work we do not see this kind of samba.
Cuca also has an previous album, “Cape Verde Nha Cretcheu”, so it can be said that it has explored, in its career, the various Lusophone sounds, going beyond fado, mixing sounds?
This album has not departed from my will, and I think [it's a sign] life leads me deep down. This album is born from a tour I made for the nine islands of Cape Verde with the live recording of the warm I sang on each island, because I sang the traditional warm of each island. Between one island and another there are very different warm. What I did was, after my Fado concerts, sang two warm and then compilationed all the themes in Creole in celebration of the fact that it was the first international artist to make the nine islands in a row. But I was also in Goa and did my concert in Concanim. I have ease and I like to learn the traditional songs from the countries where I will sing. I already sang in Moscow and learned a Russian song; I learned the songs of Goa, and at Georgia, in Tiblisi, I also learned a song. It is a treat I do when I travel the world to take the fado. But the warm is wonderful and there really is like this musical genre, and wanted to bring to Cape Verdeans this meeting between Fado and the warm, and this album, which is beautiful.
Since Macau is going, can we expect a song in Cantonense, or Mandarin?
Yes. I had already spoken to my manager to contact someone in this regard, so that we could discover a traditional song I could learn.
Last year celebrated 15 years of career. How do you review your career, which started with the albums "Cuca Roseta" and "Root"?
In fact, it was great to celebrate the 15th anniversary at MEO Arena [Lisbon Show Room] and be able to revisit all albums from the first. The "root" has opened something that is rarer, which is the fadista compose and write her lyrics. This was a disk that went wonderfully well and, from there, it was good, because in this search for the truth that fado has, being able to compose and write the letters themselves is always to give us a little more. Each person composes and writes in their own way, and when it can do it, it is always a little like the palm lines, that is, it is something unique. In this search that people do by following patterns to achieve success, I believe this exists when we are not afraid to follow our voice and instinct, what comes from our hearts, tell our stories and sing our melodies without fear. In this way we end up becoming unique. Although not usual in fado a fado singer composing and writing, it was beautiful to see that my songs became important to many fans. Sometimes I have great composers and poets [collaborating with me], but I think [writing and composing] brings this side of the person being real. My poems can never be compared to those of the great poets I've ever sung, but I think people feel that I'm more on my skin. In a way, this touches them and thrills them. Celebrating the 15 years of career was the closure of one cycle and the beginning of another, and it was great to go back to the root, and to realize that it was in it that was the "gunpowder", in the sense that we were not afraid of ourselves.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:24:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Hui So-Ying, protagonist of the movie “Ah Ying”: “To represent is being human”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/30/hui-so-ying-protagonista-do-filme-ah-ying-representar-e-ser-se-humano/</link><description>In 1983, Hong Kong's cinema, by Allen Fong's lens, revealed “Ah Ying”, a film that portrays the hard life of a girl who sells fish on the market and dreams of being an actress. This girl was Hui So-Ying and "Ah Ying" was inspired by her life. HM talked to the actress on the sidelines of the “Making Waves-2nd Hong Kong Cinema Show”, which took place this weekend in Lisbon
 
How did you get involved in the project of this movie?
The main reason I got involved in this movie was because my theater teacher passed away. So I felt that I needed to do something to honor him, because he taught me to represent. So I tried to be an actress. Subsequently, when [the director] Allen Fong met me, he found my life story interesting, also eventually meeting some of my family members. Then he asked if they were also interested in participating in the movie, which led many of them to enter the project as well. The film also shows the environment in which my teacher lived, is a portrait of experiences and stories lived by me and my teacher.
The film portrays Hong Kong's life in those days. How did you prepare for the character?
The beauty of this movie is very related to the collaborations that were made, namely in photography and costumes. It was necessary many collaborations to create the beauty that exists in the movie. It was hard work to take on the character [of Ah Ying], because the story was conceived to describe some of my past experiences, and that's what the director wanted to do. But that was hard for me, because there were some things I didn't want to face, but I had to do it. Of course then I realized that, deep down, it was nothing, and I even felt relieved after finishing the filming. Thinking whether the story was an art form or reality, when I was representing, I had to enter the situation of the moment because, in fact, the [Real] episode had passed, but I had to have certain feelings again during the representation. As an actress, it was a great test.
"Ah Ying" is considered one of the great films of the so -called "new vacancy" of Hong Kong cinema. During the round, expected the success of the movie?
I didn't think about it, but throughout the project I thought Allen Fong was a very bold director, because a movie of this kind had never been made in the history of Hong Kong cinema. It is a kind of "docudrama", and he had the strength and courage to innovate in the way of filming, which, for the time, was unprecedented.
What was the big challenge you faced in this movie?
It was having to return to my old self. There were things I didn't want to face and I had to face them again, with the same feeling I had at that time.
Between 1983 and the current one spent many years. Looking back, what meaning this movie had for you, as a person and actress?
In fact, after seeing the movie, I saw him only as a story. For me to represent it is being human, every day they are a performance.
The film portrays Hong Kong's life in the 80s and gained a restored version. What do you think this project can bring to a younger audience to see the movie today?
This year the movie has been screened several times, and I always do the same question, if people don't understand the movie or if they think it can't be immersive enough. In fact, given my experience, most younger viewers responded that this is not the case, that the movie is quite real. It doesn't seem to me that this movie is outdated or out of fashion just because times have progressed or society has changed. I don't think that.
"Ah Ying" ended in Lisbon the second edition of "Making Waves - Hong Kong Cinema Show." How do you feel to see this movie screened in Portugal?
I found it interesting. I never thought the movie could be screened in this show, I don't know if it was because there is a restored copy. Before this new version it was harder to display it. The audience can see a film that shows family relationships lived in the 1980s, and I think that the film can be immersive [in the theme], when it addresses family conflicts, because everyone has a family. Seeing the film may wonder what the relationship with your family members is like. Of course I also hope you have learned more about Hong Kong. But although this movie is set in the 1980s, it focuses a lot on family and interpersonal relationships.
Is there any episode of the filming that has marked it?
Throughout the movie there were several moments, but the one that left me biggest impressions was the last scene, of the interview, where I was talking to a chair, but it was like I was talking to my teacher. When I see this scene again I am always moved, because my teacher has passed away, but all this still impresses me a lot.</description><pubDate>2025-09-30 00:42:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Jorge Figueira, architect and academic at the University of Coimbra: “The Heroic Relations” of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/jorge-figueira-arquitecto-e-academico-da-universidade-de-coimbra-as-relacoes-heroicas-de-macau/</link><description>It has long written and thinks architecture, and since time Jorge Figueira, architect, academic at the University of Coimbra, does it in Macau. After a session this week that highlighted the former Fai Chi Kei Public Housing Complex, Manuel Vicente, Jorge Figueira today approaches the Rui Cunha Foundation O Legado de Nuno Portas
 
Today participates in the Conference “Nuno Portas: From Architecture to Urbanism, from man to city”. What legacy did this Portuguese architect have left?
Nuno Portas is someone who in the late 1950s has a critical activity that is totally innovative and pioneering in the Portuguese context. Then, in the 1960s, he had a more international activity, having been the first to publicize the work of Siza Vieira. That's when he had the first contacts with Spanish and Italian architects, fundamentally. Also in these years he wrote two books that were also unusual, such as “Architecture for Today” in 1964, and “City as Architecture” from 1969. They were also an extraordinary way to try to catch what was going on in terms of international currents in architecture. But then there was also a [important] activity as an architect alongside Nuno Teotónio Pereira, namely in the work of the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Lisbon, and in a house in Vila Viçosa. Then, with April 25, 1974, he was appointed Secretary of State for Housing and Urbanism and launches the Saal - Outpatient Services to Local Support, a completely revolutionary social housing program, according to the spirit of the time. Then Nuno Portas devoted himself more to the issues of urbanism and not so much of architecture. He was linked to the beginning of Expo 98. It turns out to be someone who in the last 20 years of his work has more scientific and sociological concerns, and less artistic. It's something you had from the beginning, but then it becomes the hundred of your activity.
Did Nuno Portas have a relationship with Macau?
I think relationships would not be so intense compared to other architects and contexts, but we know that Nuno Portas was in Macao at the government's invitation to a conference between 2001 and 2002. It is interesting because of this passage we have echoes of what happened, as his surprise when discovering the Ellen Liang orphanage of Manuel Vicente, he did not know. It was the first work of Manuel Vicente in Macau, from the 60s, and we know that Nuno Portas was thrilled to visit this work, especially the small chapel that exists in the orphanage. It is interesting because there was no direct relationship between Manuel Vicente and Nuno Portas, they are very different poles figures, and even opposite. There is also an interesting and positive reference to the Siza [Vieira, Expansion Plan of the city of Macao (Areia Preta and Outdoor Port, 1982], and when Nuno Portas visits Macau is being built. It is interesting to have commented on this plan because in the 60s and 70s the relationship between Nuno Portas and Siza Vieira was no longer the same, and the fact that he had made complimentary references to Siza is very interesting.
He was a student of Nuno Portas. What other aspects of your career or personality can highlight?
I also worked with him. He was a cultured man, very intelligent and with an overwhelming memory. It was someone who liked to provoke, but in a good way, to discuss, to counteract. I was lucky enough to maintain a dialogue with him for decades, and this is my personal knowledge that I will convey. I also notice that it was a man very close to the power of Lisbon, the parties, but always very independent. He was a personal friend of Jorge Sampaio, he was secretary of state, but never had great political protagonism. On the one hand, this is due to his independence, but on the other he was such a controversial and intelligently restless figure that I think power was also startled by him.
This week also spoke at the “Lisbon, Porto, Macau, Maputo: Heroic Collective Housing from the 60s &amp; 70s” conference. How do you describe Macau's public housing projects in those years?
There are many architects that I could talk about, but I focused on Manuel Vicente's work in Macau, namely the public housing complex at Fai Chi Kei, which was demolished and then gave rise to the project of Rui Leão and Carlota Bruni. I did not speak concretely about Portuguese or Macanese architects, we also have names such as José Ways. Also because the Portuguese architects have always been few in Portugal, and from the 1950s there were about 150, then greatly increasing in number. But I made [at the conference] a tribute to the Portuguese architects who built during this period, because in a complex territory and with their vicissitudes, different from those that existed in Portugal, they knew how to do architectural experiences in the field of extraordinary public housing. I tried to demonstrate what was happening in Lisbon, Porto, Macao and Lourenço Marques, currently Maputo, in different ways. In Macao, relations were established, which I call heroic, in the sense that they were relations of experimental architecture, in which people had to adapt, to have their own spirit. These are architectures already with a little history, as it has passed 50 or 60 years, but the examples we find in these cities have continued to be remarkable.
What projects highlight these years?
I talked about Gonçalo Byrne's housing development “Pantera Pantera” in Chelas, Lisbon. I showed the “five fingers”, by Vítor Figueiredo, also from Lisbon, and the “Bouça neighborhood”, from Siza Vieira, in Porto. I showed Manuel Vicente's Fai Chi Kei complex and a Pancho Guedes project in Mozambique. Although they are already distant in time, these are architectures that remain fundamental references of the cultural and architectural points of view. There is a kind of narrative luck to be able to talk about such different sites, and with such different architects, and show how they had this heroic, experienced, even radical, experienced side that had the architecture of this particular period.
Has Macao had a positive evolution with regard to public housing supply?
I arrived in August and have been visiting the territory in recent years, so I have been following this process a little. Macao is obviously an extraordinary territory and from the outset by the coexistence of very different cultures regarding housing, which here has a completely different scale and expression of the Portuguese. In Portugal there is an aversion to public housing towers, it has always been unusual and the results that are known have not been successful for various reasons. But in Macao this is exactly what we see, public housing in towers and with a very strong expression. This has to do with the characteristics of the territory and also with a certain culture of China and Hong Kong. This is not to say that everything that is being built in Macau is good, there are towers and buildings with less interesting solutions or that result from a certain repetition. But there is no city that only has good architecture or good public housing. The challenge is to solve the large -scale housing problem, something that must be studied and thought. It is beautiful and overwhelming to see that Macau is a territory that grows day after day and it is exciting to observe this from the point of view of architecture. This is what I am doing, working on future projects.
Analysis projects, or academic?
Yes, I am a teacher and researcher at the University of Coimbra and columnist for the public newspaper, so my work is very much to analyze and investigate. I already published a lot about Macau and I want to resume some ends that I left to solve, let's say. I am very stimulated with everything I have seen and the people I have spoken with, and maybe I will increase my work on the territory from an academic point of view and at the plan of the investigation.
At a time when Portugal has a chronic housing problem, with a lack of public housing, could Macau be an example?
No directly, because of the typological issue of the housing tower. It might not be a welcome model in the Portuguese context. But no doubt Portugal needs to learn from other experiences and other territories and need to find solutions. Surely what happens in Hong Kong and Macau are experiences that are very interested in knowing, not to replicate, but to realize that this is a global problem [the lack of housing].
Remember Nuno Portas
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) receives today, from 6.30 pm, the Conference “Nuno Portas: From Architecture to Urbanism, from man to city”, with Jorge Figueira. It will be time to talk about a route that the newly failed architect began in 1959, with a text about the new generation of the modern movement in Portugal. Texts followed in the 1960s and 70s with “scientific approaches”, with Nuno doors to a walk between architecture and urbanism, always in a reflective way. Nuno Portas was a “multifaceted figure, better known for launching the Saal Social Housing Program, which is still the target of investigation and an example”, describes Jorge Figueira in a note. The speaker is linked to the Center Social Studies and Department of Architecture of the University of Coimbra.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:33:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, Academic: “China is a reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended at the University of Aveiro the doctoral thesis that analyzes how China has been positioned in recent decades as an important actor in the “global health governance”. Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | FIA makes known 10 teams from the FR World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/12/gp-fia-da-a-conhecer-10-equipas-da-taca-do-mundo-fr/</link><description>On Wednesday night, the International Automobile Federation (FIA), in partnership with the Macao Grand Prix Organizing Committee, published the official list of teams registered for this year's Macao Grand Prix-Cup of the FR da FIA.

They won the first weekend race, thus reaching the sixth triumph of the season, and finished second in the second race. This second place raised to 10 the number of podiums obtained in 10 races, extending the impressive team series, which never ended below second place.
With two races still playing in the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals in Misano, Italy, in November, SJM Theodore Racing could focus on maintaining this impressive podium sequence, with the main objective of the season achieved. Charles Leong and Alex Denning are tied at the top of the pilot standings and are expected to complete the season side by side, sharing the same Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2.

For Charles Leong, this result is the result of “incredible team work. We won the championship thanks to a great collective effort, without great mistakes and with total consistency.

Since 2019, the classic proof of resistance was not disputed, and to mark the return of this iconic race in the Rising Sun Country, Porsche Motorsport Asia Pacific decided to decorate the three cars that supported with historic colors of the Stuttack brand. Among them, one of Absolute Racing's Porsche 911 GT3 R was painted yellow and black, in honor of Joest Racing's victory in the 1985 Le Mans, when Portuguese Domingos Piedade was a sports director of the German team.

“We maintain a close and friendly relationship with the renowned national brand of Real Almost Models. The founder, Liu Xueshen, Mr. Sum, has always enthusiastically supported my comics, now becoming one of the main sponsors.

The charismatic British pilot continues to recover from the serious accident suffered at Isle of Man TT last June and is not fit to fight for tenth victory
 
In early summer, in the great classic of road, Michael Rutter fell off the motorcycle on the last lap of the Suartwin race, in the place known as 31st Milestone, and suffered several fractures in the spine, between the L2 and L5 vertebrae, even being transferred by helicopter to the hospital. The 53 -year -old pilot was also diagnosed with an ankle fracture.
After nearly three months away from the competition, “The Blade”, as he is known in the middle, made his return to motorcycling last August, participating in the famous classic TT parade, on top of a Honda RVF750 RC45, integrated in a tribute to the 1980s and 1990s. Of his nine wins in 1998, he went back to a motorcycle for the first time in the Classic TT, where he led a Honda RC45 in the 1980s and 1990s parade. However, Rutter is not yet prepared to return to the competition, the Irish publication News Letter said in the past week.
His last victory was achieved at the Guide Circuit in 2019, although not the way Rutter would like to have increased his palm, as the result was decided on the basis of positions after just one lap, after two red flag interruptions that led to the definitive cancellation of the race. Still with ambition to win a tenth time at the Macao Motorcycle Prize last year, deeply affected by bad weather, Rutter was disappointed with the result, having qualified with the fourth best time, in a race in which the result of the qualification determined the final positions of the race.
Before the accident at Isle of Man TT, Rutter had told News Letter that he wanted to travel to Macau at the end of the year. "We'll try again because it's another race that I really like to go. It's completely unique, it's on the other side of the world, one time zone, so it's unique," he said without knowing what he expected.
Another big question
Rutter may not be the only "historical" of the Macao Motorcycle Prize to be left out of this year's edition, as many doubts around Peter Hickman, he also victims of an accident at the Event of the Island of Man. The British accident was caused by a mechanical failure: the setting of the exhaust departed, causing it to come into contact with the rear tire and caused a hole that led to the fall of the experienced. Pilot. The winner of four editions suffered severe injuries: collarbone and left -blavado fracture, three broken ribs, four fractured vertebrae and still facial injuries.
In a social media publication, Hickman said he has worked “very hard” behind the scenes and even recently performed a test on Cadwell Park. Three months after the accident, he returned this weekend to the popular British Superbike Championship in Donington Park. The 38 -year -old has not yet recovered his best and the requirement of a city circuit, such as Macao, is far superior to a conventional circuit. So in the coming weeks it will be known if Hickman will try to conquer his fifth victory on the streets of Macau in 2025.
The 72nd Macau Grand Prix will take place between November 13 and 16 this year. In addition to the 57th Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, the program also features the Macao Grand Prix -FR's FR's World Cup, the FIA ​​GT GT Cup, the Macao Guide Race -Kumho Fia TCR World Tour of Macau, the Macao Formula 4 -FIA Formula 4 Cup (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge.</description><pubDate>2025-09-08 02:43:40</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Event literature is expected to grow in the coming years</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/01/gp-literatura-do-evento-devera-crescer-nos-proximos-anos/</link><description>The literature on the Macau Grand Prix could continue to grow in the coming years. The release of the Macao Grand Prix-Personal Collection of Victor H. de Lemos, 1954-1978, volume II (1967-1978), by Macaense Carlos Lemos, residing in Toronto since 1974, will take place in November, not in October as initially expected, while a new book on motorcycling provies is forming form.
This change in the date is not related to any delay, but to the date of visit to the territory by the author. Following the success of Volume I, the second part of a book that aims to honor the author's father, Victor Hugo Lemos - an enthusiast of the Macao Grand Prix who, in life, collected a vast number of photographs and everything that was related to the Automobile and Motorcycle Races in Macau since 1954, the date of the first edition of the event.
“This second volume completes a significant part of my father's Macao Grand Prix Collection, Victor H. de Lemos. It is a 356 pages hardcover book, ie 100 more than the first volume,” says Carlos Lemos. “Content and composition are very identical to those of the first volume. Includes more chinese newspaper clippings and documents the first fatal accident, the failed attempt to create the Extreme Orient Automobile Association Circuit, the first edition of the Guide Race, the Giant Race and the gradual evolution of the Macao Grand Prix, from amateur races to a world -class event, recognized by the International Federation. of the car (FIA). ”

The presentation should take place at the headquarters of the Macao Retirees, Reformed and Pensioners Association (Apomac), at date and time to reveal.
A book about motorcycles
The literature on the Macau Grand Prix could continue to grow in the coming years. Carlos Barreto, the author of the book History of Karting in Macau, written in co -authorship with Pedro Dá Mesquita, is considering writing a book about motorcycling in the Macao Grand Prix, a discipline that sometimes ends up in the background in terms of literary coverage of the more than seventy years of the Guide Circuit event.
"The idea is to gather the testimonials of pilots from Macao who participated in the proof of motorcycles of the Macao Grand Prix," Carlos Barreto told HM. “We already have some material collected; there is still a lot of collection of collecting, compiling and writing the story, selecting the images, etc… We are in a hurry!”
The Macao Grand Prix today has only one motorcycle test on the program, the Macao de Motorcycle History, but it wasn't always like that. The event even had more than three motorcycle races, and even scooter races took place at the Citadino Circuito da MSA, always with a very strong presence of local pilots.</description><pubDate>2025-09-01 03:08:38</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
