In the offices, it is expected that the rents will drop between 4.5 and 6.0 percent, while in stores the maintenance of the value is expected.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 01:18:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Galaxy | Tenor Andrea Bocelli concert at the end of March</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/galaxy-concerto-do-tenor-andrea-bocelli-no-fim-de-marco/</link><description>The Galaxy Arena receives, on March 29, Andrea Bocelli for a concert that marks the singer's debut in Macau.

In addition to cutting the connection with the sea, and violating the zone classification regulation, the terrain has a slope for water, functioning as a natural barrier. The work was awarded to Nam Kwong by 565 million patacas
 
The construction of “flood prevention equipment and reordering the water drainage system in the dikes and Shizimen canal” will soon begin to prevent flooding in the immediate vicinity of the Avenida de October of Colaane, Coloane and Cais de Colaane and from lai chi vun.
The work motivated some criticisms, including the urban planner and a member of the Lam Iek Chit Cultural Heritage Council, who says he has complained on different occasions for the conflict between and the works projected and the administrative regulation on the classification of Lai Chi Naval Shipters VUN. However, it never obtained response from the authorities.
Speaking to the Cheng Pou newspaper, the urban planner recalls that the administrative regulation provides for the establishment of a protective zone in Lai Chi Vun, which requires the maintenance of the characteristics of the Rio and the natural landscape. According to Lam Iek Chit, these characteristics will be concerned with the construction that will imply the cut of the connection between the shipyards and the sea.
The government states that the work is essential to mitigate the problems of floods located on the west side of Coloane caused by storm tides and heavy rains.
The Law of Gravity
The urban planner considers that the government has easier, effective and much cheaper solutions to protect Lai Chi Vun dwellings against storm tides and heavy rains. The simple installation of barriers or protections in houses is a solution presented by LAM, without large expenses for the public purse and without violating the administrative regulation and the protection law of cultural heritage. In addition, the very characteristics of the place, with a slope to the sea, form a protection for the houses in the immediate vicinity, unlike in Vila de Coloane. Still, the urban planner understands that in the village of Coloane the installation of barriers in homes would also be sufficient to prevent floods, or from a more cautious perspective the construction of a dike.
In addition to these issues, Lam Iek Chit says the government has not published scientific data on flood protection plans at different levels. According to the work of the work, the company NAM Kwong Union Commercial and Industrial gained the award of the project, with a price of 565 million patacas and a period of completion of 710 working days.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 01:13:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Elderly | IAS ponders adjust subsidy value</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/idosos-ias-pondera-ajustar-valor-de-subsidio/</link><description>Without compromising, and remembering that the elderly allowance has risen 7.5 times since 2005, the government says it will consider adjusting the value of support according to the economic situation of society, budgetary provisions and the attribution of other social support. Last year, about 130,000 elderly people received the 9,000 patacas allowance
 
The government of Sam Hou Fai will study the possibility of adjusting the amounts of social supports intended for the elderly, such as the subsidy and pension for the elderly. The guarantee was given by the president of the Institute of Social Action (IAS), Hon Wai, in response to a written interpellation of Nick Law.
Regarding the pension for the elderly, which has maintained in 3,740 monthly patacas since the beginning of 2020, and the installments of the Social Security regime, the Social Security Fund (FSS) will study its adaptation “to social development”, to “ respond to the real needs of residents. ” To optimize the regular benefit adjustment mechanism and the indexing of the base of the pension for the elderly to the value of social risk, Hon Wai indicated that “the financial situation of the FSS itself, socioeconomic development” and the results of the evaluation of the 'Elderly consumer price index' ”.
Regarding the subsidy for the elderly, whose value of 9,000 patacas has not been reviewed since 2018, the government indicates that “in the future”, “will consider the possibility of adjusting the amount in accordance with society's economic situation, budgetary provisions and the various social support measures ”.
Ho wai also points out that since its implementation, the elderly allowance has risen 7.5 times “from 1,200 patacas in 2005 to 9,000 patacas in 2024”, a value that remains unchanged in the last six years. Last year, the allowance was distributed on October 17 to 130,641 beneficiaries, and had an approximate global value of over 1.175 billion.
By other ways
The president of IAS also stressed other benefits for the elderly contemplated in the MSAR social support network, such as monetary reimbursement, health valleys, extraordinary office of budget balances, free medical assistance and free public transport, which guarantee “basic protection at various levels of everyday life ”.
Regarding the older population in financial difficulties, Hon Wai indicated that the government "has established a regular mechanism to support families who do not have enough economic resources to meet basic needs." Therefore, single -padded families with chronic patients or disabled members who are beneficiaries of regular allowance can also receive special allowance for vulnerable families.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 00:53:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Housing | Raymond Tam guarantees T2 and T3 construction</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/habitacao-raymond-tam-garante-construcao-de-t2-e-t3/</link><description>The secretary admits that the government's goal is to create a permanent candidacy mechanism for the purchase of economic housing and allow families with small houses to move to others
 
The Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam, guaranteed yesterday that the public housing policy will have as a priority the construction of apartments T2 and T3. The promise was left yesterday in the Legislative Assembly, where he was answering the questions of the deputies.
"In the future public housing policy we will consider the construction of more dwellings T2 and T3," said Raymond Tam, after being confronted with the fact that these are the type of housing most sought after by the population.
The secretary acknowledged that currently part of the population living in economic housing has to deal with the fact that apartments sold if they have become too small with the growth of families. Economic housing is a type of housing sold to people at more affordable prices compared to those practiced on the market.
However, before you can advance with the construction of more houses, Raymond Tam acknowledged that the short -term solution will have to create a mechanism where families living in a T1 or T2 will be able to exchange for more rooms. “In the short term, to solve the problem, we can allow the exchange of fractions for the larger ones. It is a measure that can be taken in the short term and we expect to improve housing conditions in both social and economic housing, ”said Tam.
Social housing is another type of public housing for disadvantaged families, which are leased by the public administration with more affordable prices than those practiced in the private market.
Price Changes
Throughout the session, and with changes in the private market, where prices are increasingly cheaper, deputies such as Leong Sun IOK, linked to the Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom), suggested a reduction in economic housing prices.
"Currently, the price of private and public housing is practically the same, and this influences the desire to buy," said Leong. “Economic housing can only be sold in the market after 16 years, and at limited prices, so it should have affordable prices. I ask the government to make an assessment of the prices currently practiced, ”he said.
A similar request was presented by Deputy Ron Lam: "We have to take into account the situation of the real estate market that is also undergoing changes," he said.
In turn, Raymond Tam replied that the offer of housing in zone A of new landfills will take into account the changes in the market, and ensured that any changes are “being analyzed”.
Regarding the possibility of a permanent mechanism for buying economic housing, instead of residents are limited to the opening of competitions by the government, TAM promised that this will be the situation in the future. However, plans should take time to be implemented due to the lack of available houses.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 00:48:37</pubDate></item><item><title>APN | Sam Hou Fai met with representatives of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/apn-sam-hou-fai-reuniu-com-representantes-de-macau/</link><description>The Chief Executive organized a dinner to ask Macao representatives in the national organs who are the "good voice" of the territory.

HM talked to António Queirós before the lecture on the subject he gave yesterday at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center in Lisbon
 
Will talk about the theme “The Environmental Crisis and the China Eco-Civilization Project”. What project is this?
This is China's great project for the New Age. It is a concept that began to be elaborated from 2013. This idea began to be realized with different projects. Since the “New Democracy” regime, which resulted from the Chinese resistance to the occupation of Japan and the geopolitical confrontation of the countries of the axis of different democracies. This is when the Popular Republic of China is proclaimed, such as the proclamation of the “new democracy” and comes awareness of the environmental crisis worldwide by China, with the regime to evolve into the so-called “ecological socialism” From 2003. It was necessary for the country to experience a model of industrialization common to the first experiences of socialism, and especially the capitalist countries. China's fundamental thesis is that all regimes can collaborate in building a new civilization, but this implies outdoor democratic reforms that are consigned in global civilization proposals, guaranteeing peace according to the principle of indivisibility of security. But I would like to point out the moment when the United Nations (UN), representing the whole world, became aware of the existence of an environmental crisis, from the Stockholm Conference, which took place in 1972. On the part of the organs of the socialist state, citizens and parties, it began in 2003. It is strange that issues like this never be debated to the West. The ideological confrontation that comes from the Cold War did not cease with Helsinquia's agreements, and therefore there are themes that are unknown to the West because of this harmful tradition of the Cold War, which has extended, and because the media have no openness. to discuss and present the proposals that China makes.
China is present and is an important actor in world meetings on environment and climate. Why do you understand that there is no discussion the West about the concept of eco-civilization?
It is not discussed why the West there is great ignorance about China and the reality of the country. The only advantage I have about most people who write and talk about China is that my relationship with the country is over 50 years old. I know how China was presented to the West 50 years ago. We lived [in Portugal], a fascist regime where information came to people with great difficulty. I have seen these years to all kinds of visions about China that lacked concrete information, because the country, until reform and openness, was a closed society. But this lack of information was general in the West. I also had visions that were not reality and I began to question myself if China's historical experience is unique, without parallel in the history of society, democracy and socialism, for its historical characteristics, hermeneutics, in the sense of method, analysis, analysis of concepts and starting points, which predominates the West, does not serve. But then let's go to the concrete issue, which is the responsibilities that China has in environmental matters.
Which, specifically, are…
One thing is the contribution that give China, India and other countries to global warming, because they are populations that represent most of humanity. There are technologies that are themselves polluting. But if we look at this angle we ended up falsifying reality, because greenhouse gases that exist in the atmosphere have been at least 150 years ago due to European and American industrialization. In terms of historical responsibility, the US is largely responsible [for global warming], and I cite official European Union data, for example. I speak of tons of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere in all these years.
Because they industrialized much earlier than China.
Yes, and presented an industry without this kind of environmental concerns. Therefore, this reality is hidden, which greenhouse gases have begun to pollute for 150 years and that it is not only today's contributions [which are the major causes of global warming].
Therefore, the idea that China is the main polluting country finds it wrong.
In current terms China and India can be the most polluting. But they are neither in “per capita” nor historically. What is really [in the Western discourse] is that they currently contribute [to global warming]. But then we have to see the trends where we are going to walk. But if we deepen this topic we have come to even less favorable conclusions to Western policies. China's environmental history can be summed up at four periods. The first period is in the years of reform and openness, from 1978, and the fourth period is when China launches the pilot projects of ecological civilization. The process is global. Still in relation to China's responsibilities, in the first phase the West and the industrialized east carried to China the most polluting industries, because China's appeal was to industrialize and create more employment. The UN resolution that adds an article beyond the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, finally recognizes as an inalienable right of the human being to a healthy environment. This statement, the West, completely truncated, reduced to no thing, has a preamble with 30 articles in which the environmental issue is not posed. Since this statement is no longer in line with current political and social reality, it has been moving, mutilated and reduced to formal freedoms. Also ignored by the set of citizens who do not know their origin either. China is co-founder of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a fact that is also concealed. But I also wanted to talk about the largest fallacy of the Western environmental policy.
What is it?
The idea that, from now on, one will protect nature. So what is done to what was destroyed? Especially in developing countries, because it was there that we sent these residues from the polluting industries and exploited all resources. No one wanted to know that, and what did China did? He assumed the leadership of the process and through his diplomacy to "act without acting," Tao's way, without violating nature, respecting the laws and dignity of things, approving the Kunming-Montreal agreement [on biodiversity]. We then have a commitment that the US probably will lie down to the rubbish crate to recover the biotypes that are destroyed, because much of the world is in environmental crisis and has so far been whistling to the side. China has a gradual view that risk factors in the environmental crisis tend to decrease with China's effort, both nationally and international. But the most remarkable issue in the idea of ​​building an ecological state in the country was the fact that, at the initiative of President XI Jinping, principles of environmental philosophy were included in the Statutes of the Chinese Communist Party, unprecedented in another Communist Party and even some ecologists.
Global reformulation
According to the study “Ecological Civilization in the People's Republic of China: Values, Action, and Future Needs”, by Arthur Hanson, published in 2019 by Asian Development Bank, the concept of ecological civilization “is being used by the Popular Republic of China ( RPC) to provide a coherent conceptual framework for adjustments to the development that responds to the challenges of the century XXI.
It differs from sustainable development in the emphasis placed in political and cultural factors, as well as in the definition of new relationships between people and nature that allow you to live well and within the eco-environmental boundaries of planet Earth. ”
In addition to reducing pollution and promoting circular economy, for example, they are also considered “domains of finance, law, institutional reinforcement and technological innovation”, having already been defined some ideas in five-year plans approved by Beijing, highlighting If “needs in the medium term, especially until 2035, when ecological civilization, in its basic form, is expected to be fully implemented for the modernization of the RPC”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 00:36:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Human Trafficking | Beijing defends collaboration with Thailand and Myanmar in the fight against crime</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/trafico-humano-pequim-defende-colaboracao-com-tailandia-e-myanmar-na-luta-contra-o-crime/</link><description>China reaffirmed yesterday the intention to collaborate with Thailand and Myanmar in the fight against human trafficking networks after the Thai authorities began to repatty Chinese citizens held in captive by criminal groups.

He still studied law, exercising law in Italy, but the song eventually won him.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 01:29:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Robert De Niro debuts on television on the conspiracy thriller “day zero”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/20/robert-de-niro-estreia-se-em-televisao-no-thriller-conspiracionista-dia-zero/</link><description>The new miniseries "Day Zero" on Netflix marks the debut of Oscarized actor Robert de Niro on television, in a thriller in which he plays an former US president called to discover the authors of a devastating cyberthyrach.
"The argument was so good, not even needed prior preparation," said the actor, at a press conference of the series in which Lusa participated. “The dialogue was excellent. It might have been pier, pretentious or biased, but in this case I wouldn't be here. ”
“Day Zero” was filmed over seven months in New York, with Robert de Niro being critical to this location. "For some time I had spoken to my agent about doing anything in New York," said the actor, who is also a six -episode miniseries producer.
The cast includes Angela Bassett, Matthew Modine, Jesse Plemons, Lizzy Caplan, Connie Britton and Joan Allen.
Created by Eric Newman (“Griselda”, “Narcos: Mexico”), Noah Oppenheim (former president of NBC News) and Michael Schmidt (journalist), the miniseries departs from a massive cyberataque that turns off in the United States for a minute and causes chaos and thousands of dead.
Robert De Niro plays former President George Mullen, called by current President Evelyn Mitchell (Angela Bassett) to preside over a committee to which unheard of investigation powers are given. The director Lesli Linka Glatter ("West Wing", "Homeland") described the series as "a paranoic conspiracy thriller."
"The idea came from conversations about our relationship with the truth," said Eric Newman at the conference. "It's something global: we have entered a post-truth age where truths can be mutually exclusive."  One of Mullen's antagonists is the author of a podcast, Evan Green (Dan Stevens) who plays with suspicions and throws accusations without proof to monetize the hearing's ultrasound.
"Green represents the bangs that operates around a story like this," said the actor. "He is annoying, a divisive figure who thrives with division and makes it his coin." But the argument does not take a position and none of the interveners comes out particularly well, with a varied range of doubtful decisions, except for former President Sheila Mullen's wife, who maintains integrity.
"What we hope that people will take this is that, although the mechanisms by which we determine the truth can be broken, perhaps irreparably, it is still possible to do the right thing," said Newman. "Although it is a disconcerting view of humanity, in the end there is a certain optimism and hope."
Cocriador Noah Oppenheim said the team started working in this story several years ago and that it is amazing to see how what has happened in the real world mirrors the chaos that the series portrays. "If we think about the threats we face, be it cybership, climate change or nuclear war, the largest of all is the inability to agree with a shared set of facts," he said.
Angela Bassett, who plays President Mitchell, stressed the importance of “seeing this representation of a woman” as the actress “in a place of power in the oval room”, something that excited her to do the series, besides being the second time to work with de niro.
Also Connie Britton, who gives body to Valerie Whitesell, found the humanization of highly political situations interesting, which often forget that behind power positions are human beings with complex relationships and personalities. "This shows us how our choices can have an impact on everyone," he said while the characters try to maintain decorum and respect the high positions.
"These acts of balance are what we do in real life, even if we are not in high risk espionage or cybership," he continued. "We are all trying to find a balance between our responsibilities and intimate relationships."</description><pubDate>2025-02-20 19:00:41</pubDate></item><item><title>China | Synthesized a hexagonal diamond harder than the natural</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/china-sintetizado-um-diamante-hexagonal-mais-duro-que-o-natural/</link><description>A team of Chinese researchers was able to synthesize Lonsdaleita, a rare form of hexagonal diamond with a hardness 40 percent higher than the natural diamond.
The discovery was made by scientists at the University of Jilin and Sun Yat-Sen University, China Daily said on Wednesday. The development group recently pointed out that Lonsdaleita was obtained from graffiti submitted to extreme pressure and temperature conditions.
"The synthesis of Lonsdaleita has been a focal point of research for scientists around the world over the past 50 years," said Yao Mingguang, professor at the University of Jilin State Superduct Materials Laboratory. Lonsdaleita, discovered in 1967, is naturally formed in places of impact of meteorites, although its artificial synthesis was a challenge for the scientific community.
To achieve it, Chinese researchers have applied pressure of 300,000 atmospheres, six times higher than necessary to make conventional diamonds. As a result, they obtained crystals up to 1.2 mm in diameter, a size considerably larger than those obtained in previous attempts.
In addition to its exceptional hardness, synthesized Lonsdaleita displays remarkable thermal stability, remaining stable up to 1,100 ° C. “Newly synthesized diamonds have thermal stability and remain stable at extreme temperatures,” explained Yao.
This feature may allow its application to ultra-resistant and semiconductor materials. Despite the progress, industrial production is not yet viable: “Finding appropriate catalysts can make way for it,” said the investigator. The team now seeks to optimize the process to move from laboratory synthesis to manufacture in large volume.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 01:27:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Islands Hospital | Creation of tour packages under study</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/hospital-das-ilhas-criacao-de-pacotes-turisticos-em-estudo/</link><description>The Islands Hospital is “conducting preliminary market studies on the content of medical tourism packages, its criteria for charging fees,” said the director of health services, Alvis Lo, in response to a Ho Ion Sang interpellation .

February 2025
The Chinese tradition says that the classic works of culture were not just four books: The Analects (《論語/1 论语》 lunyǔ), the book of Mâncio (《孟子》 mèngzǐ), the great study (《大學/大学》 dàxué) and The Doctrine of the Meio (《中庸》 Zhōngyōng), and five classics: The Classic of Mutations (《易經易经》 Yì Jīng), The Book of Odes (《詩經诗经》 Shījīng), The History (《史記/太史公記 // 史记/太史公记》 Shǐjì/tàishǐ gōngjì), the rites (《禮記礼记》 lǐjì), the annals of spring and autumn (《春秋》 Chūnqiū)), but four books and six classics, because there was one more relative to the music (樂經/乐经) Yuè Jīng, which in the meantime was lost.
However, “music” (樂/乐 yuè) is so important to the Chinese that their synogram is confused in the written form with that of “joy” (樂/乐 lè).  From an etymological point of view, it is the pictogram of a musical instrument, whose base represents the wood part and the top the strings of it.  This, for the satisfaction that raises when it is touched, will serve by extension of meaning to figure the synogram of joy.
Music before belonging to humanity, depends on the deities of the Chinese popular animist religion and natural forces such as wind or biological beings such as birds, or mythological like fenices.  It is known that the yellow emperor (黄帝 Huángdì) ruled in a mythical antiquity that dates back to organized Chinese civilization. But this, according to one of the great Taoist philosophers of Chinese antiquity, Lie Yukou (列御寇 Liè Yùkòu ”) in the homonymous work Liezi (列子“ Lièzǐ ·) puts the emperor to make spiritual trips in which he finds feminine deities of matriarchal times, as Huaxu (華胥/华胥 Huáxū), mother of the first Chinese emperor Fuxi (伏羲 Fuxī) and, therefore, ancestral matriarch of all Chinese or the mysterious mother and/or woman of the ninth sky (九天聖 (圣) 母/九天玄女 jiiǔtān shèngmǔ/jiiǔtān xuanǚ) taught a lot, even in the case of the latter to appreciate music, poetry, having also started by her, who had a human face and Phoenix Body, in the Arts of Love.
As for Phoenix is ​​the bird that symbolizes eternal life and peace; When the gray itself is reborn, it transports the hope of whole, renewed and peaceful beings, as it only arises in the world in times of tranquility and harmony. But it is also in close relationship with the music, because it is a mythological bird that sings, such as the wind, whose sound is composed for the Chinese by the melodious beating of the wings of the birds, when it comes to breeze, or the beating of the same in storm.
Linglun (伶倫/伶伦 Ling Lun) created the twelve shades following a request from the yellow emperor, which after being properly polite and trained his musical ear for the mysterious woman of ninth sky, was bored in the trips of inspection by Earth with The monotony of melodies. This great musician rushed to fulfill orders and surrendered with soul and heart to listen to all the sounds of nature to obtain the inspiration required to the mission. But it was in the Kunlun Sacred Mountain (崑崙山/昆仑山 Kūnlún Shān) that he obtained the lighting necessary for the creation of twelve shades by resorting to twelve bamboo tubes. How did he verify the right tones? “Loading the twelve bamboo tubes, Linglun reached the foot of the Kunlun mountain to hear the song of the Phoenix. When the birds sang, the male gave six shouts and the female answered them with six others. Linglun compared the twelve screams with his sounds and found that there was a perfect match between them. ” (Wang and Alves, 2009, 48)
He had reached his goal. The shades followed the model of the Phoenices, when he presented his creation to the Yellow Emperor, having been precisely rewarded with the title of God of Music [音樂 (乐) 之神 Yīnyuè Zhī Shén] and the world has since filled with More beautiful melodies.
Going now to philosophy, the cosmos faced as a mysterious musical instrument is one of the favorite metaphors of one of the great Taoist philosophers, the prince of Huainan, Liu an [劉 (刘) 安 Liú'ān, 179? -122 BC] It leaves us a work of the early days of the Han Dynasty, entitled Huainanzi (《淮南子》 Huáinánzǐ). The work is known in the Chinese tradition also with the title of (《淮南子鴻烈》 Huáinánzǐ Hóngliè), whose meaning is “the radiant light of Master Huainan”, having been the sixth chapter translated by Canadian synologist Charles Le Blanc, under the Title Huainanzi 淮南子 Philosophical Synthesis in Early Han Thought, containing the suggestive Subtitle The Idea of ​​Resonance (Kan-Ying 感應) with a Translation and Analysis of Chapter Six.
Suppose that the whole universe is linked, in the manner of the ropes of an instrument, spreading the sound, echoing and resonating when it touches on a ropes, will have its western counterpart in the mysticism of the Pythagorean pre-Socratic philosopher and its assumption of the “music of the spheres”, that is, the melody produced by the stars in their heavenly trajectories.
Returning to the Master of Huainan, he is informed in section II of the IX of the sixth chapter, that “the mutual response of things belonging to the same category is deeply mysterious and extremely subtle” (BLANC, 1985, 116), to which the text corresponds to the text Original is in Appendix 1 (Blanc, 1985, 221-215): “夫物類之相應玄妙深微知不能論” (6/ 3a.5) 2. These lines can be explained by resorting to another postulate, “the mutual influence of spiritual qì 3 (天神氣 shén qì)” “” (6/4a. 1), whose visible action manifests itself in the similarity of the outer forms of things, But also in the complementary game of the female and masculine forces that make them creative and transforming, and the superior action, as the Taoists believe, is based on the invisible mutual response and Silent (相應 Xiāngyìng), that is, not discursive, which does not preclude what is intuitive and melodious.
The mutual resonance is sustained by a complementary game of the energies yin (陰/阴 yīn) and yang (陽/阳 yáng) at the most varied levels, guided by the principle of causality, which acts between similar and different beings, because it arises O Qì enable and unite what is distinct, in a perfect resonance, so as to figure the cosmos as Taiji or “Supreme last” (太极/太極 tàijí). Thus, section IV of Chapter VI is achieved, where musical resonance (6/6b.9-11) is exposed, which works metaphorically to introduce universal resonance, implying a “great immersion” in the “supreme harmony”, impossible to explain (Blanc, 1985, 138). We are told that an tuner of Sè (瑟), an instrument of Chinese strings with 25 strings (vaguely recalling an Arabil), when touching a rope, will obtain the mutual harmony of the same rope in another instrument. However, “if someone changes the tuning of a rope so that it does not respond to any of the five notes, but when touching it gets a resonance with the 25 strings, then there is a difference with regard to the sound, succeeding that it was evoked that to govern all others. ” (Ibidem) “改調一弦其於無音無所比鼓之而二十五弦皆應此未始” (6/6a.11).
The sage, holy, or supreme musician will be one who can put himself in a direct intuitive connection with Tao (道 道), without herself being able to provide the reasons for it. Dip in the numenal world, play and mix essences, becomes what you want and lives in mutual resonance, absolute and total musical, with all that exists, not just relative to your "similar."
There is a music story for Guqin (古琴 Gǔqín), another instrument of seven -string Chinese strings, told by Taoist philosopher Liezi in the chapter of the previously mentioned homonymous work, yellow emperor, 11th section, (《列子 黄帝》第十一 黄帝》第十一部分 Lièzǐ · huángdì ”dì shíyī bùfèn), which illustrates this universal resonance, easier To obtain to those who have a spontaneous mind, as it succeeds children, and as the founder recalls Taoism Laozi (老子 lǎozǐ), the perfect heart (心 xīn) is that of a newborn. In the story that I present my translation below, the protagonist is a boy with whom birds play naturally, but when his father asks him to capture one of them in order to entertain himself, the birds distance themselves, That is why the score for Guqin calls itself “the distance from water owls” 《鷗鷺忘機/鸥鹭忘机》 ōuu lù wàng jī 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgte7wzut1y
原文 Original text (classic Chinese)
海上之人有好漚鳥者 ， 每旦之海上 ， 從漚鳥遊 ， 漚鳥之至者百住而不止。其父曰：「吾聞漚鳥皆從汝遊 ， 汝取來 ， 吾玩之。」明日之海上 ， 漚鳥舞而不下也。故曰：至言去言 ， 至為無為。齊智之所知 ， 則淺矣。5
Contemporary Chinese
海边有个喜欢鸥鸟的人 ， 每天早上到海上去 ， ， ， 跟鸥鸟玩耍 “我听说鸥鸟都爱跟你游玩 ， 你抓一只来 ， 我玩玩。 ”第二天他来到海上 ， 鸥鸟都在空中飞翔而不下来。所以说：“ 最好的语言是没有语言 ， 最高的作为是没有作为。同别人比试智慧的想法 ， 那是很浅陋的。
There was a boy near the sea that liked a lot of water owls. Every day, he used to stroll by the sea where he played with the birds, more than one hundred.  Once, the father commented: “I heard that the water owls often play with you, grabs one for me so that I can also entertain me with them. “The next morning, by the sea, the birds danced over his head, but they didn't approach. For this reason it is said: “The best speech is speechless, the best action is not acting. If wisdom can be compared, then it is superficial! ”

The spokesman added that China will continue to take steps to “protect people's life and goods” and preserve exchange and cooperation with countries in the region.
However, it avoided giving details about the identity of repatriated citizens, their health or the circumstances of their rescue. "For specific information, I refer to the competent authorities in China," he said.
Thailand yesterday began the repatriation of thousands of people, mostly Chinese citizens, who had been taken by criminal groups and exploited in centers dedicated to online fraud on Myanmar.
The first of the planes took off yesterday with 50 passengers on board, although it is expected that a total of 1,041 Chinese will be sent to his country among the 7,000 foreigners to repact in the coming days, according to the estimate made by the Thai Prime Minister this week , Paetongtarn Shinawatra.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>António Graça de Abreu</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/antonio-graca-abreu/</link><description>"Jorge Mazcarenhas Foy to have the city called Chincheo, where it seems to him that he was richer people than in Canton."

“We arrived at the port of Chinchéu, we found three ships from Portuguese that had been a month ago that were arrived (from Liampó) of which we were very well received and wrapped with a lot of party and contentment and then gave us new land, and the merchant , and the peace and quiet of the port. ”

"When the Portuguese, in the 16th Century, Recovered China to European Knowledge, Zayton Was in the longing the great haven of forreign trade."
Henry Yule, The Book of Marco Polo The Venetian, London, John Murray, 1874, Chapter LXXXII, II Vol., Pag 221, Note 2.
Among the reports of our 16th century chroniclers and adventurers there is some confusion as to the exact location of the place we called Chincheo. The toponym appears associated with two different but close spaces, the cities of Quangzhou 泉州 and Zhangzhou 漳州 or, by extension, the Chincheos will be the inhabitants of the current province of Fujian, and Chincheo may still be the name of the province itself. Now to Quangzhou, the two characters - who sound like "chuanchou" in Mandarin - have the approximate reading of "Chinchew" in the local pronunciation, in the Hokkien or Fulaohua 福佬话 福佬话, (the old language of Fujian), a subgroup of the great min of the South South spoken in the province of Fujian. From "Chinchew" to the chincheo of the Portuguese in China goes a very short step. Moreover, it is curious that, in addition to the Mandarin, the most spoken dialect in Taiwan, Formosa, is exactly the Hokkien since part of the island's population is originally from the Quangzhou region, emigrated to Taiwan in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Not wanting to enter any other discussion, I believe the city of Quangzhou, such as Liampó or Ningbo 宁波, in the neighboring province of Zhejiang, [1] will be the major ports of commerce and shelter of the Portuguese of the first half of the 16th century, still still Before the foundation and fixation in Macau, which will only happen from 1553/55, after our sailors, merchants and adventurers were expelled from these Two cities by the Chinese because they are foreigners and have assumed real behaviors, the “pirates of the sea” as the Chinese called us. Just read the saga of António de Faria in the pilgrimage of Fernão Mendes Pinto to understand how to trade but also loot, steal, live extremely part of the Portuguese hundredists of the Portuguese by lands of China. Just as they entered the daily lives of other peoples, including Chinese.
Quangzhou or Chincheo, or if we want to Zaiton of Marco Polo that in his book he considers her “a of the two best and Mayors that sound in the world” was one of the first places on China's back to navigation, point of scale and often at the beginning of what is conventionally called the “sea silk route”. From here he left Marco Polo on his long return trip to Italy. It is believed that Zaiton, the Arab name in Quangzhou,-also associated with “olive”-gave rise to the words “satin” in English and “satin” in Portuguese, all related to the many tons of silk that exported by Porto from Quangzhou. [1]
In the dynasties Song and Yuan (from 960 to 1368), the city has reached the zénite of its development as the great warehouse of the seas of Asia. They were Muslim merchants, especially Persians - who since the ninth century they gave body to the expansion of Islam to the vast Southeast Asia - which settled in Quangzhou where they calculate they had reached 150 thousand souls. It was so strong its economic power in the city that between 1345 and 1365 were the subject of a brutal persecution by the Chinese powers, and there were thousands and thousands of dead. In the fourteenth century, Zaiton was also inhabited by Jews, Hindu and Catholics, and the Italian Franciscan Andrea of ​​Perugia was the first bishop in the city in 1332. Then dozens of mosques and three churches, all devastated in the persecution in those years.
In the summer of 2013, I am in search of the city of Zaiton, Quangzhou, Chinchew or Chincheo.
Seventy kilometers of bus since Xiamen and I arrive in the city that seems to me harmonious, well distributed by the valley and the hills that surround it. Where is the river, where is the port? I ask and are saying that Quangzhou has no sea port, only at the mouth of the river, in front of the islands, there is a small port for fishing boats. Path miles along the Jinhera River towards the sea. The river is hardly navigable, everything is blown away, the sand and mud have once deposited in the bed of deep water, the current city lives almost its back facing the Jinhera River and the ocean. The great port of Zaiton, the most likely Chincheo of the Portuguese in China, was swallowed by the mud, the sands deposited in the river, and, before its mouth, the waters almost disappeared with the centuries.
I get a taxi and tell the driver's wife, an affable and friendly lady, I want to go, always on the bank of the river, to the mouth. It's four or five more kilometers, but the driver asserts me that there is no large port, just a village of fishermen and fishing boats. We advanced on the road. I guess a hundred trainers, all blue, made in China, moved down there. There is even a port at the mouth of the river, also with benches and restingas, with a lot of sand and mud, but a port against the sea.
I leave the taxi and advance to the pier, for fishing boats aligned next to the jetty, I enter the confusion of those who arrive with fish to discharge and to sell. Women carry heavy buckets of fish suspended at the end of bamboo sticks, others sitting in stools clean crabs and oysters, others, still, with an entredious hair that turns on the head in a safe pulling by a kind of chopsticks, packing fish Loose and seafood that sell in small lots. There are men playing Weiqi, Chinese chess, and players loudly hitting the top of makeshift tables. Some fishermen, certainly tired of the sea, are quietly watching the bullied mixed with the calm of these seaside people.
Attraven the street, the way to the village next to the side that seems to keep the past centuries. Low wooden houses, some of one townhouse, decrepit and poor. Narrow streets, quite filth, small shops, one or another house of food, almost only fish and seafood, old planted in the threshold of houses, boys jumping happy by alleys and alleys. I'm in Quangzhou, in the chincheo of five hundred. Porto and the city should be so in the sixteenth century and, when returning, I prove, that I am not in a village but in the extension of the old Quangzhou urban fabric itself. Almost guessed Fernão Mendes paint with the conversation with António de Faria, perhaps his alter ego, in a reed, anchored at the mouth of the Jinhera River, here, Chincheo, the year 1545.
The next day, visit the Quangzhou Maritime Museum, meeting the history and the many navigations for these seas of Fujian, southern China.
In the fundamental Chinese sources there is almost no reference to Portugal and the Portuguese. If we were the first to terrify these stops, in the sea connection between Europe and the Empire of the middle realized in 1513 with the arrival of Jorge Álvares to Toumen, at the current Hong Kong, Guangdong province, we were not the pioneers in the navigations along of the back and in the stay in China. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Marco Polo, the Franciscan Muslims and missionaries, all journeying for the old Zaiton, deserve the honors of museum exposure, with the exposure of stones and headds recently discovered with extensive texts in Arabic and tumular stones with Christian crosses.
It is interesting to show the different types of boats that in the past have ventured into these seas, from the high-sea junctions of Admiral Zheng He (1377-1433) that with these ships navigated to Mombasa in 1433, to the stems and ships, these yes linked to a Portuguese presence. Also noteworthy is the patriotic figure of Zheng Chenggong (1624-1662) or Koxinga, who from pirate spent the national hero after expelled in 1661 the Dutch seated 38 years ago at Forte Zeelhand, Taiwan, where they controlled Formosa Island.
Even next to the Maritime Museum is another three-story building, which also works as a kind of museum, the Islamic Cultural Center where the Muslim community once resident in Zaiton/Quangzhou is honored. At the entrance we came across a statue of IBN Battuta (1304-1377), Tânger's great natural Arab traveler, just below our Algarve, who in the fourteenth century undertook a very long journey to China and left us a fabulous account of their travels, something similar to the “book of Marco Polo”. Battuta lived for a year in Zaiton, exactly 1346. In the Garden of the Cultural Center we found a cemetery for the deceased illustrious Muslims in the city and it is also worth visiting the great Qingjing mosque, originally built in 1009 by the first proselytes of Islam and that remain restored ruins, and a portico. Taking advantage of the space adjacent to Qingjing, a new mosque has just been built with money from Saudi Arabia, not too large, but witnessing a long -term and relationship, not always affectionate and peaceful, between Islam and China.
Returning to our five hundred sailors will be to remember that the Portuguese of then were not much given to visit mosques, pagodas, Buddhist temples or Taoists. But in Quangzhou/Chincheo, since the year 686, a magnificent set of pavilions and pagodas dedicated to Buddha veneration, the Kaiyuan temple. Around the year 1100, in the Song Dynasty (960-1279) was inhabited by more than a thousand monks. Today, in the temple of Kaiyuan, stand out the two beautiful stone pagodas, equal, not too high, just five floors with the walls covered by low-relevous original, all dated from the thirteenth century when Zaiton or Quangzhou was one of the big cities From China.
Few people visit Kaiyuan. The unfolding of the gaze, a little reverence for the Buddhas, remember Portugal and the Portuguese of Anthony, and dilute me in the serenity of the day.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Vocational Education | Alert Study for Human Resources Failures in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/ensino-profissional-estudo-alerta-para-falhas-em-recursos-humanos-na-china/</link><description>A study published in The China Quarterly concludes that there are still many questions to resolve so that technical-professional education in China can respond to human resources needs. The work warns of the “rapid massification” of this type of education, with priority for “number of enrollment over quality”
 
Technical-professional education in China has been popularized, but a recently published study in Cambridge University Press's “The China Quarterly” magazine, concludes that there are still gaps to find that courses can actually respond to needs of the country in terms of labor in the industrial sector.
“More Graduates, Fewer Skills? Vocational Education Expansion and Skilled Labar Shortages in China ”[More graduates, less skills? The expansion of vocational education and qualified labor faults in China] is the name of the study developed by Xinmiao Song of the University of Lingnan, and Duudo XU of the University of Hong Kong Department of Sociology.
Academic work draws attention to the “disturbing trend” of “rapid massification of vocational education, which gives priority to the number of enrollments to the detriment of the quality of education” and that “does not respond to the search for skills and hand-based training qualified work ”.
In addition, the authors add to the “adverse consequences for both administrative management and teaching, caused by this scenario. “The development of competences often is up to post-school professional associations and an exclusive group of elite students. However, reform initiatives, such as the Manual Arts Campaign and competency contests, benefit only a few, without improving the prospects of employment of the student population in general. ”
Thus, the two academics argue that “more attention to the tensions inherent to China's teaching and vocational training system”, because “only when there is a deeper understanding of the underlying causes to the ineffective training of competencies in vocational schools China can achieve its national objective of industrial modernization ”.
The study was developed in two vocational schools, and interviews were conducted to 104 students. In addition, ethnographic data of four doctoral projects were used in the area of ​​vocational education, developed between October 2017 and December 2020.
It is also noted that the country needs “increasingly urgent” of qualified workers “due to world economic competition”. However, "despite the massive expansion of the teaching and vocational training system in the last two decades, there is still a significant deficit of qualified labor," there is "debates about the ineffectiveness of vocational education." These focus above all on, “in the absence of institutional synergies between teaching and industry, but they often ignore the conflicts inherent to the vocational education system and the processes of competency training at the micro level”.
Practical difficulties
To the “micro level”, that is, in schools, the authors denote the existence of several difficulties in the effective functioning of these courses in line with the intended results.
In secondary education there is “a delicate balance between the promotion of social equality and the development of skills”. However, "analysis indicates that, in the context of the rapid expansion of secondary education, schools have difficulty effectively harmonizing these objectives."
“In order to maintain a proper student body, schools and teachers are often obliged to compromise the quality of candidates and teaching standards in the classroom. This situation generates a change in daily pedagogy and school administration to preserve discipline and stability, thus attributing the development of skills and the selection of talents-ideally a mission from the whole school-to extra-curricular professional associations, pursued Just for a few, ”is added.
It is also concluded that “the acquisition of competences is a multifaceted process, shaped by the dynamic interaction between educators and students”, because “the academic preparation of students and their motivations to learn are equally pertinent for the formation of microcompetences, such as the These are the resources of schools and the capabilities of teachers. ”
Thus, “the resolution of the ineffective formation of competencies requires more than the top -to -base initiatives”, “an approach that recognizes the obstacles that students face in the acquisition of competences, as well as their seizures and uncertainties are necessary. In search of a job ”, it is mentioned.
The authors also talk about “elitism” in some formations related to handicraft courses and “competency contests”. "These initiatives may inadvertently suggest that handicrafts are reserved for a restricted number of people, as competencies contests often remain inaccessible to most vocational education students, both objective and psychologically."
Thus, the authors emphasize that "there is a significant undoing between this elitist approach to the acquisition of competences and the real conditions faced by vocational education students."
“The superficial promotion of manual labor spirit and the exclusivity of competences failed to truly resolve the challenges associated with the acquisition of skills, the search for employment and the commitment to follow technical professions among vocational education students,” is also mentioned.
Still, limitations in the study are referred to, namely the fact that it focuses only on public schools in higher secondary education, and the results may not completely represent other levels of vocational education, such as the higher institutes of vocational training ”.

Numbers from the “Factory of the World”
In the study is the intense industrial development that China has achieved in the last 40 years, emerging as the "factory of the world," as the authors describe, "taking advantage of their demographic dividends."
“However, the intensive model of labor growth has proved unsustainable due to population aging and intense global competition. To escape the 'trap of medium income', the Chinese government has launched a series of industrial modernization actions in the transforming industry and services sectors, ”but“ despite the ambitious agendas for the next decade, the persistent scarcity of qualified workers continues to hinder these efforts, ”is referred to.
By 2020, there were more than 23 million students of vocational education, so “this scarcity of skilled labor is a surprise”, is referred to in the study, which highlights “the substantial efforts and resources that the Chinese government dedicated to Improvement of vocational education in recent years ”.
For example, “Free Secondary Professional Education, the expansion of higher vocational facilities in one million students from 2019 to 2021 and the creation of universities of applied technology” emerged. In addition, the vocational education system watched an unprecedented trajectory, with enrollment in secondary professional schools higher than increasing from 4.56 million in 2004 to 7.11 million in 2009 ″.
In terms of the need for human resources, the study cites data from China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security for 80 cities in the country. “The ministry's quarterly reports revealed that the workfold/person who seeks skilled labor reached a historical peak of 2.0 in early 2020”, and “higher-level qualified workers, technicians and the upper technicians had a particularly high demand. ”
It is also noted that the Ministry of Education provides that the country continues to confront this year, “with a deficit of 30 million qualified workers, which represents a 48 percent break in domains such as materials, the savings of energy and vehicles powered by new energies ”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:25:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Work | Future Ready Talent Program released in Macau and Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/17/108890/</link><description>Wynn and insurer Aia are two of the 14 companies that are part of the “Future Ready” project, launched by LinkedIn on Thursday in Hong Kong. The program bets on vocational training in the two special administrative regions, with special focus on artificial intelligence
 
The LinkedIn social network, facing the world of work, launched last week in Hong Kong, a talent formation program that has the collaboration of 14 companies from the territory and Macao, namely the Aia insurer and the operator of the game Wynn. The program, titled “LinkedIn Future Ready”, aims to “equip professionals from Hong Kong and Macau with the skills needed to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market,” is referred to in a note of the organization.
The other participating companies or entities are the Cathay Pacific airline, the Chow Tai Fook jewelery group, the PLC group, the English Schools Foundation, the FWD group, Hop Lun, Link Asset Management, Mtr Corporation, a company Hong Kong's meter, and PCCW consultant, without forgetting Prudential, Swire Properties, which operates in the real estate market, and the Hong Kong Jockey Club.
The program includes "initiatives for updating skills, knowledge exchange and [sharing] of data based information." Essentially, “Future Ready” intends to “equip companies with tools and resources needed to navigate a workforce transformation scenario and promote a culture of innovation”.
Given the latest projections of the social network, which published, in January, the report "Work Change Report - Ai Is Coming to Work" [Labor Change Report - Artificial Intelligence (IA) is coming to work], the program “ Future Ready ”intends to make more training available in this area in both territories.
“The 'LinkedIn Future Ready' program is a bold initiative that aims to support the work force in Hong Kong and to Colmar Skills in terms of skills, as well as unlocking new opportunities in growing economy,” said Mei NG, director-general of LinkedIn social network in Hong Kong.
The official also added that the social network will work closely with the 14 participating companies, to build “a more resilient workforce” by providing “companies that develop and implement innovative talent strategies and ensure that their employees are equipped with the skills necessary to succeed in the future. ”
Skills below
According to the same statement, before advancing to this training program, an assessment of markets was made in both territories. It is concluded that “Hong Kong and Macao perform well in cross-cutting skills and innovation-both essential to navigating the dynamic current business landscape”, and by transversal skills, “communication, teamwork and leadership” is understood.
In terms of innovation, another factor analyzed, “Hong Kong exceeds the APAC average [Asia-Pacific countries] in innovation skills, reinforcing its role as a business center with future vision that also promotes transformation in industry” . However, the neighboring region “is behind APAC average in AI proficiency”, so the mentors of the “Future Ready” program consider that there is “an urgent need for competency improvement initiatives to help enable the workforce to work adapt without problems to technological advancement ”.
There is, in this domain, a “growing demand for AI -related skills”, as “77 percent of Hong Kong business leaders said they would hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills rather than a more experienced candidate without these competences” .
In addition, "although transverse skills remain the strongest area of ​​Hong Kong, the region continues to be below APAC average and is late in four of the five domains of critical skills evaluated."
One of the objectives of the program announced on Thursday is to “improve and requalify the labor” of both territories “for a future fueled with AI”, so that there is “a certain combination of technical and human skills”, constituting “A competitive advantage for professionals and organizations”.
The 14 partner companies will have access to more than 23,000 courses available on the “LinkedIn Learning” platform that are based on 41,000 skills sets, namely “curated learning paths, technology training, AI training and digital learning resources from Ponta ”, is explained.
The future accelerates
According to the same report released by LinkedIn in January, AI's growing adoption worldwide will lead to a "search for new jobs and skills." The social network data reveal that “more than 10 percent of hired workers currently have positions that did not exist in 2000, including functions such as data scientist, social networking manager, sustainability manager, customer success manager and AI engineer manager ”.
In the present case of Hong Kong, by 2030, “60 percent of all skills used to do a job will have changed, with the innovations of accelerating this transformation to 80 percent”, is mentioned. Thus, it is concluded that "this rapid pace of change has created a gap of competencies that is difficult to conform in the short term."
In addition to betting on professionals, the “Future Ready” program also wants to promote ideas and debates, promising, for example, “quarterly round tables for executives” and meetings “with sector leaders to discuss the evolution of jobs, skills and requirements of learning ”. “The program will also provide a platform for the sharing of best practices, influencing the widest development of the workforce in all sectors,” is still added.
Also noteworthy is that the LinkedIn report on changes in work structures describe the most usual forms of AI use, namely communication in human resources or marketing. Thus, "recruiters who use LinkedIn's AI -assisted messages to involve candidates are registering an acceptance rate 44 percent higher compared to the AI ​​-free messages." In addition, “marketers who use LinkedIn's ad campaign creation tool, Accelerate, are presenting a cost per 42 percent lower compared to the classic campaigns” of this social network.
For this report were held several inquiries, namely more than 2,500 entrepreneurs from five countries (United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and India). The questionnaire focused on executives from various business areas (human resources, operations or marketing) was made in nine country and had 19,991 participants from companies with over 1000 employees. This inquiry was held from 26 November and December 13 last year.
In worldwide terms, in 2030 about 70 percent of each worker's tools and skills will change, with the “emerging as a catalyst”, and “the investments made in AI [by companies] are starting to start compensate: In the last two years, 51 percent of the business that adopted the Generative AI reported an increase in revenues of 10 percent or more. ” “Unsurprisingly, 88 percent of top executives with top management positions said AI adoption to help accelerate business is something important to develop next year,” one reads.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Corruption | Report Alert for gaps in Hong Kong and Singapore</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/14/corrupcao-relatorio-alerta-para-lacunas-em-hong-kong-e-singapura/</link><description>The 2024 Corruption Perception Index presents Singapore as the third cleaner jurisdiction of corruption worldwide, out of 180 countries and regions. Hong Kong is in 17th place in the ranking, but the report leaves a warning: world financial centers remain vulnerable to corruption
 
This Tuesday was released the perception rate of corruption (CPI, in the English acronym), which analyzes corruption in the public sector of 180 countries and regions, the responsibility of the non-governmental organization international transparency.
In the case of China, the CPI reveals that there was no significant change. If 100 points means a country virtually corruption, and 0 points a highly corrupt country, China registered last year 43 points in 100, rising a position compared to 2023, occupying 76th ranking position.
The CPI also looks at Hong Kong's situation, which got 67 points in 100, occupying 17th position in 180 countries and regions around the world. Taiwan, is currently 25th in the ranking of 180 countries, and no change of positioning compared to the CPI of 2023.
To register the presence of an Asian country on the list of the four less corrupt. This is the case of Singapore, third with 84 points in 100, following Finland (2nd) and Denmark (1st). The list of the top four ends with New Zealand.
According to official CPI data, countries and regions that are considered “full democracies” have an average of 73 points, while those who have political systems in which “faults” have 47 points. According to the index, non-democratic regimes receive only on average 33 points.
The CPI analyzes corruption in 180 countries based on sources such as studies or specialists, measuring corruption only in the public sector. However, it is assumed limitations in this count, as the ranking does not include "corruption of private companies, financial secrecy or transnational corruption."
If the score represents “the level of perception of public sector corruption on a scale of 0-100”, the country's position in the ranking is only comparison with other countries, and these lists “may change merely if the number of countries are to alter".
Looking at the global scenario, the report points out that “once again that developed economies dominate the top of the 2024 CPI ranking”, it is countries that “have a long time benefiting from a strong rule of law, the operation of institutions. Government and Political Stability - Factors that contribute to a perception of low corruption levels at internal level ”. However, "these attributes make these countries main targets of corrupt actors for money laundering and protection of illicit gains."
The Money Trail
According to the report, the fact that developed economies dominate the CPI can give a false idea that these countries "are making corruption effectively and remains untouched." “This idea could not be further from the truth. In particular, the nations that constitute large financial centers are more vulnerable to the financial flows of corruption. While their strong institutions convey an idea of ​​integrity, financial sectors and regulatory staff often provide opportunities to explore gaps, reducing anti-corruption global efforts, ”is still described.
In this regard, the examples of Hong Kong and other territories associated with offshore jurisdictions are presented, where it is not always possible to determine the trail of money. “Western financial centers such as Switzerland, Luxembourg, or the United Kingdom have a history of scrutiny of facilitating money laundering movements. However, non -western centers such as Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates progressively have played similar papers and require similar analysis. ”
“Like western counterparts, they boast the existence of a strong rule of law and institutions with a proper functioning, even though bank laws, corporate structures and secret provisions allow cases of funds washing and diversion of regulations, avoiding the Detection ”of less legal cases, is still described.
It refers to the case of the transfer of African funds to financial centers, such as Carlos São Vicente, former CEO of an Angolan state company that transferred about $ 1.2 billion to companies registered in shorts, and later transferred Tronches of money for accounts in Singapore and Switzerland. Only for a Singapore reported account, 558 million US dollars were transferred.
Opacity here
With regard to Hong Kong, it is revealed that by 2023 the territory "fines for four banks in a total of $ 3.2 million, negligent 0.0085 percent of the profits reported by these same banks this year."
Still regarding Raehk, it is revealed that "there is no central registration system on the possession of beneficiaries - it is simply required for companies that maintain this information for themselves." “Some types of investment funds are still exempt from maintaining records from their owners. With more than 1.4 million companies registered in 2023, maintaining compliance with monitoring these rules is a huge challenge, creating gaps in shadow actors can easily explore ”, it is also described.
It also states that "opacity is even worse with regard to investment funds," with Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates "not having any form of registration of funds beneficiaries." “As a result, even the authorities have no way to know how many funds there are and how they operate in their countries, leaving the active adjacent to these funds alone. In cases where illegalities are suspected, authorities trust the beneficiaries to provide information: a process that consumes a lot of time and is not efficient, ”he adds.
Money and climate
In general terms, the CPI report points out that, in the Asia Pacific region, "leaders have failed to wage corruption in the middle of climbing a climate crisis." In a note signed by Ilham Mohamed, Yuambari Haihuie and Urantsetseg Ulziikhuu, regional advisers of international transparency, consider that “governments throughout the Asia Pacific region continue to fail in anti-corruption promises”, drawing attention to the fact of the region face many natural disasters and be “home of one third of the world population, with the second largest number of young people ”from the world.
“With no concerted efforts to combat corruption now, the first generation that is facing the extreme climate change will face disastrous consequences,” is described.
"Corruption obstructs environmental policies, wages climate financing and prevents advancement in regulations and policies, making those who have less resources more vulnerable," the report, which points out that corruption waging "the effective use of money. ”In the fight against climate change.
Pakistan is mentioned, “which has suffered unprecedented climate vulnerabilities in recent years, with systemic governance failures and barriers in the implementation of policies - including delays in the implementation of regulations and establishment of institutions within the 'Climate Change Act 2017' - have left The context of financing far below the US $ 348 billion projected for the end of 2030 ”.
Also noteworthy is the case of Vietname, which had 32 projects of solar and wind energy under investigation due to “abuse of power”. The report describes "that the lack of civic space for effective inspection, as well as a limited number of mechanisms for effective complaint systems support - such as informators protection - has threatened these fundamental programs."</description><pubDate>2025-02-14 00:11:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Macao Platform seen in the context of Chinese foreign policy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/19/diplomacia-plataforma-de-macau-vista-no-contexto-da-politica-externa-chinesa/</link><description>In "Paradiplomacy in China: Macao's role in relations between sino-Portuguese countries," Xu Heng Wang concludes that the role of platform with Lusophony "can be seen with extension of China's foreign policy." However, the MSar presents its own ideas, without “complete obedience to the central government”, indicates the academic
 
Macao's diplomatic role in the relationship with China and Portuguese -speaking countries was the focus of Xu Heng Wang's doctoral thesis defended in January at the University of Coimbra (UC) Faculty of Economics. In “Paradiplomacia in China: the role of Macau in relations between the Sino-Portuguese-speaking countries”, the author argues that, regarding the role of Economic and Commercial Platform of MSA in Beijing's connection and Portuguese-speaking countries, there are A certain extent of Chinese foreign policy, but at the same time ideas of the local authorities.
"Although the role of Macao as an economic and commercial platform can be seen as an extension of China's foreign policy, this does not mean that Macau is in a state of complete obedience to the central government," is referred to in research work.
Although it is stressed that “it is difficult to discern Macao's desire to develop, it must be mentioned that Macau has his own ideas about the course of his development”, namely in relation to the game and the entire economic structure.
“Macao has long foresaw that the structure of his economy would be unbalanced and that the game would be dominant. Authorities and academics have also made many debates on the issue of unsustainable development based on the game industry. At the same time, Macau is also very aware of its advantages in terms of cultural integration, having carried out the construction of a historic and cultural city, becoming a tourist attraction. ”
Between the own ideas and what is defined in the field of foreign policy by Beijing, there is "a direction of the development of Macao which, basically, is consistent with the role that the central government has conceived to Macao."
In this context, the author concludes that “the interests of Macao and the central government are basically the same”, being “a special case of paradiplomacy in China”, due to the implementation of politics “one country, two systems” in the territory and of high degree of autonomy that gives you in several areas.
THE ROLE OF THE MACAU FORUM
Xu Heng Wang took a different approach on this issue, not resorting to traditional international relations theories, because “Macao interactions involve both state and non-state actors,” so these theories “do not provide an accurate explanation from the role of Macao ”. In this way, and to understand the role of Macau in the relations between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, the idea of ​​paradiplomacy with Guanxi theory, a term used to describe social, economic or political relations that can enhance business or others was combined to describe to describe to describe to describe to describe business or others Benefits.
Thus, it is said that “the creation of the Macau Forum can be considered one of the prominent paradiplomatic activities”, with “Macao playing a role that mixes its development with the strategic objectives of the Chinese central government, especially with regard to countries of countries Portuguese Language ”.
Macao has performed some relevant activities in the relations between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, ”although it is assumed that“ the results have been limited so far ”.
The academic states that these activities are "mainly concentrated in the fields of economics, education, tourism, culture and technology, with political effects that are not yet so evident." In addition, it is pointed out that "the influence of Macau on the relations between China and the different Portuguese -speaking countries has varied in intensity." Still, "much of the interaction and cooperation between Macao, China and the Portuguese -speaking countries occurred through the Macao Forum."
Help with objectives
In general terms, the “paradiplomacy of Macau is a complex and fluid process”, and the territory “shows its identity as a world center of tourism and leisure and a characteristic financial center with international activities”, with the aim of “improving the economic structure ”and make a diversification beyond game.
The author highlights fundamental areas such as services for small and medium enterprises, exchange-cultural and bilingual talent formation. In addition, it is explained that “the central government provides political support to Macau based on its foreign policy needs, with the reinforcement of cooperation” with Portuguese -speaking countries. In these actions, include the Great Bay project, as well as the idea of ​​Macao's establishment as the Renminbi Compensation Center (RMB).
“On the one hand, the central government provides conveniences to Macau and helps [the territory] to establish its identity, 'supported by the mainland China market'. On the other hand, it helps Macau to develop the activity of RMB compensation center for transactions that occur on the Macao negotiation platform. ”
Thus, it denotes the author, "the role of Macao in paradiplomacy, but as an assistant to the implementation of central foreign policy, is also evident." However, "the paradiplomacy of Macao does not only reflect the diplomatic objective of helping the Chinese government to establish relations with Portuguese -speaking countries, but also the improvement of Macau's own international influence."
The doctoral thesis also presents a practical case analysis of Macau's relationship with the most striking Portuguese -speaking countries in the economic relationship with China, namely Angola and Brazil. "For Angola, Macao has played an approach role to China," as the African country needs "foreign investment for the hydroelectric power, infrastructure and agriculture sector." Thus, the binding axis is made at the Macao Forum, where "Angola can establish relations with the Chinese central government and cooperate on investment, in addition to the oil sector."
In addition, "most of China's investment in Angola comes from large companies, while small and medium -sized companies still depend mainly on Macau for commercial cooperation."
In the case of Brazil the situation is slightly different, because “in sino-Brazilian relations, the role of Macau is not obvious”, more “centered around the BRICS”, a group of emerging economies initially founded by Brazil, Russia, India and China , and today has ten member countries.
“Although the first ministerial meeting of the Macao Forum (2003) preceded the first meeting of the BRICS (2009) leaders, the impact of the Macao Forum on Sino-Brazilian Relations is not obviously as good as the established influence through direct meetings . Therefore, in the early days of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, relations between the two countries developed more at national level. ”
It is also highlighted that "although the role that Macao has in the opening of a door to the mainland China market has been established in Brazil's eyes, the impact of Macao on sino-Brazilian relations has not yet become obvious."
It is certain, however, that in recent years "the continuous development of the Macao Forum and the continuous improvement of organizational activities, its attraction to Brazil has become increasingly evident." “As Brazil tries to expand trade, commercial cooperation and investment with China will no longer be concentrated only in national business giants and will be increasingly targeted at private companies,” is still completed.
Regarding Portugal, the “attitude is very positive”, to the existing historical connection. “In many memos and statements signed with China, Macau has been stated to play an increasingly important role as a link between China and Portugal. Portugal and China have great technical cooperation in the domains of new energies, aerospace industry and other technological innovations. There is also a profound relationship of cooperation in the field of education. ”
It is also noteworthy that Portugal “not only signed cooperation agreements in the field of teaching with universities in the interior of China, but also signed several cooperation and exchange agreements with the main universities of Macao”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-19 00:24:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Defense | World expense increased by 7.4% in 2024</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/defesa-despesa-mundial-aumentou-74-em-2024/</link><description>The world's expense with the defense sector increased by 7.4 percent in 2024, but European countries can be unlikely to keep their pace due to internal budget pressures, according to a study published yesterday.
According to the Military Balance 2025, produced by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), public expense with defense reached $ 2.46 billion last year, increasing in all regions of the world except in sub -Saharan Africa.
European investment has grown in particular, especially the 23.2 percent increase of Germany, which would have surpassed the United Kingdom in military spending in second place in NATO behind the US.
IISS estimates that, as a whole, NATO European members spent $ 442 billion from the defense sector in 2024, less than a third of the total Atlantic alliance expense, which rises to $ 1.44 billion.
“With the persistence of budgetary pressures in most European countries, it is likely that it is difficult to maintain the increase in expenses. The burden is not widely shared, with some NATO countries to spend more than 3 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), while others remain below the base line of 2 percent, ”says IISS, in a statement.
In real terms, the European defense expense has grown 50 percent in nominal terms in the last decade, according to the Military Balance 2025, which every year makes an assessment of military capacities and the world -level defense economy.
The study includes updated data on military structures, equipment inventories and defense budgets from more than 170 countries.
IISS estimates that an increase to 3 percent of GDP of all European NATO members would grow the amount more than $ 250 billion and almost $ 750 billion if the 5 percent value was reached, as it reached Suggest US President Donald Trump.
"However, these values ​​are unattainable at this time, with some countries resorting to extra-organizational instruments to reinforce budgets," the British Study Center acknowledges. As for the US, although this country spends in defense 3.39 percent of GDP, “limitations are evident in its industrial defense base” due to the need for investment and modernization, he says.
Complicated accounts
The IISS estimates that Russia's military expenses increased 41.9 percent by 2024, overloading the budget for the equivalent of 6.7 percent of GDP, which is higher than the total of the European expense with the defense in terms of parity of the Purchase power.
However, it states that the Russian economy remains resilient thanks to revenues from non -energetic sources, which allow you to maintain a reduced budget deficit and central bank measures.
According to the military balance, it is increasingly difficult to quantify the Russian expense with the defense due to financing by regional entities, private companies and even families, which pay equipment and basic provisions. About China, IISS accounts for internal reorganization and reforms to make the military structure more efficient, namely through the fight against corruption, investigation and increased capacities, namely equipment.
The Chinese budget in 2024 was estimated at about $ 235 billion, an increase of 7 percent compared to 2023 and an amount equivalent to 44 percent of total expenditure in Asia.</description><pubDate>2025-02-13 01:42:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Pecunaries Checks | An economic "comfort" that has generated debate</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/cheques-pecuniarios-um-conforto-economico-que-tem-gerado-debate/</link><description>The pecuniary reimbursement program started in 2008 to distribute the fruits of the development of MSAR by residents. However, he returned to the agenda the possibility of leaving outside those who do not live in Macau. Sonny Lo describes the measure as an economic "comfort", while José Félix Pontes says that altering politics entails "courage"
 
Every year permanent and non-permanent residents, whether they have many or few economic possessions, receive, respectively, ten thousand patacas and six thousand government patacas. A check that is obtained only because it has a resident identity card, whether or not resident in Macao. According to the government, the objective of the pecuniary reimbursement program has always been the sharing of the economic success of the territory with the population, obtained largely with the taxes charged on the game.
However, in recent weeks there are no shortage of voices, especially in the Legislative Assembly (AL), asking those who live outside Macao stop receiving the check. The issue was once again discussed yesterday on the Macao Chinese Macao Forum Program of Macau, with Nelson Kot, president of the Macao Social Synthetic Studies Association, to argue that the checks should be attributed through the performance of the various social classes. Thus, the values ​​would be different.
“Some elderly do not have many income and depend on the reform to live. If this group of people receives a higher value check, your life can improve. If you consider the principle of social justice, the government should consider the form of distribution of pecuniary checks depending on the various social classes, taking advantage of ways to increase the rights of some groups, ”he said.
Lei Chun Kwok, vice president of the Macao Economic Association of Macau also participated in the program, recalling that when the checks were launched in 2008, the local economy suffered from the impact of this year's worldwide crisis, so the check of checks aimed to support to support population dealing with increased inflation.
Then, in the pandemic, he remembered Lei Chun Kwok, eventually constituted another support, given the attribution of checks in advance. Also academic at the University of Macau recalled that for residents who do not live in Macau, the potential of these checks to stimulate consumption is limited. “Given the economic perspective, if the holders of the checks that live abroad only deposit them in bank accounts, saving all the money, this does not benefit the general interests of Macao, because money does not enter the economic system or help to create economic activities. ”
Leong in Pong, Deputy Chief of the Social Affairs Council of the General Union of Macao Residents Associations (Ugamm), also defended in the same program as residents, to receive the checks, should live in Macau at least 183 days a year, as a rule too imposed on the beneficiaries of the non-obligatory central social security regime, as well as to renew the non-permanent BIR.
50 percent in vouchers
For economist José Félix Pontes, there should be no short -term changes in politics. “For the future years, and in the assumption that the government will maintain the measure (which I defend), it should be restricted [the attribution] to those who live in the MGre, at least 183 days in each year, followed by the Criteria of 'tax resident' of MSAR, ”he suggested to HM.
However, the economist understands that exceptions should be created, if the limitation advances, namely for “Macao students who study abroad, or permanent residents treated in hospital establishments in China or abroad for long periods, or teachers who teach in institutions teaching outside Macao ”.
It is also suggested by this economist that the amount of each check should be attributed to two components, namely half in check and half in “voucher” format, “so that they can be used exclusively in commercial establishments on the MSAR”.
However, José Félix Pontes considers that "it will be difficult to change the situation and it will always be a measure that the Government of the MSAR will have to reveal political determination and courage."
For analyst Sonny Lo, checks leave "a sense of comfort among residents and, ideally, should continue, even if the amount can be reduced a little in annual terms." The checks thus represent "a welfare factor that has led to political and social satisfaction in Macao."
If there are changes, Sonny Lo does not predict social disturbance, since "in Macao people are politically very calm and give relative support to the government."
Focus Objectives
Let's look at the numbers: In 2008, the first year of launching the pecuniary reimbursement program, checks were given to 534,672 residents, in the global value of 2,545 million patacas; Since the beneficiaries are about 750,000, which causes an annual expense for the administration of 7.5 billion patacas.
For José Félix Pontes, the question of the beneficiaries is not new, because “since the beginning of the distribution of these checks that has been questioned if it should be limited only to those who are actually living permanently in the MSAR, or if it should include, Regardless of the effective place of residence, any and all permanent resident ticket or non-permanent resident ticket. ”
“Also the issue of the 'income level' of each resident has been questioned, and there are those who argue that these checks should have the beneficiaries resident with lower income, or that they were from staggered amounts depending on their income. Finally, the eventual attribution of checks to 'blue card workers' (non-resident workers) has been very 'soft', from time to time, as they also contribute, in various sectors, to The development of Macau's economy, ”he recalled.
The truth is that, in resurgence of this debate, the possible inclusion of TNR, for example, was never directly considered. Deputy Ron Lam has been one of the advocates of changes to the pecuniary reimbursement program, and the government should clarify whether the measure is financial support or distribution of dividends. The deputy said that there are currently about 100,000 residents living outside Macao. Ron Lam also said that, according to data from the budgetary proposals for the 2025 economic year, the government spared 79.32 million patacas with checks that were not deposited within three years. The deputy defended a survey of the reasons so that these checks were not deposited or raised. Also, Mrs Lo Choi in defended the end of the checks for those outside Macao.
José Félix Pontes understands that it is time to think about the true objective of this policy. “The objective defined for the distribution of pecuniary checks has to be present, which consisted of sharing with the resident population of the financial success in the evolution of the economy, which is indissolibly linked to the government's revenues in the game tax . Hence talking about the distribution of the dividends of the game. However, the measure has to be seen not only as a sharing of economic gains, but also, and to some extent, as a reinforcement of the social security of MSAR residents or promoting the local economy. ”
HM questioned a resident of Macao, of Portuguese nationality, who did not want to be identified, and left the territory about a year ago, currently living in Portugal. However, the resident has already considered a possible return to the territory. About the checks, it says it is important to analyze the intentions of the executive.
“If the idea of ​​the checks is to distribute the richness of the casinos to the people of Macao, to the people who are residents, it makes no sense to end them, because people continue to have a 'rib' of Macao in some way. If the perspective is this altruism, then it makes no sense to stop the checks for those who are outside. If the question is there is a reward, there is different. What checks are what, after all? Aren't the distribution of wealth to the people of Macau? Or if you contribute to Macau receive a reward? This is the central question. If it is to distribute the richness of the casinos everyone is entitled. ”
The resident highlights the example of a person who all life lived in Macao, renovated himself and went to another country for "several reasons, even health." “It is important to know this kind of cases. But the key is to know what the pecuniary check is and what it is for. I have always been told to me it was the distribution of wealth, ”he said.</description><pubDate>2025-02-13 00:24:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Study | Reluctant government in legislating vital will</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/11/estudo-governo-relutante-em-legislar-testamento-vital/</link><description>A study by Man Teng Iong, professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Macao, and Vera Lúcia Raposo draws attention to the absence of the “anticipated directive of will”, or vital will, of the legal system of masters. The document allows a person to decide previously whether or not to receive medical treatments in the terminal phase of life
 
For several years in Portugal any citizen can sign an Early Directive of Will (DAV), also known as the Vital Testament, which allows the conscious decision on the type of medical treatments to receive in a given health context. Being far from constituting a legal form of euthanasia, the document allows to know the patient's will when he, for health reasons, cannot do so.
In Macao, the DAV is not legislated and the authorities have revealed signs of reluctance to advance in the process. This is what the study concludes “Advance Directives in Macao: Not Legally Recognissed, but. . . ” [DAV in Macao: No legal recognition, but… ”, signed by Man Teng Iong, professor at the University of Macao Law School (one), and Vera Lúcia Raposo, former director of the same faculty and currently a teacher at the Faculty of Law from the New University of Lisbon. The study was recently published by Cambridge University Press, although it was the theme of Man Teng Iong's master's thesis defended a few years ago.
The authors analyze the legal framework of the issue in Macao, concluding that “to date, the Macao Executive assumed a precautionary attitude towards DAV, accepting (or tolerating) these instruments, but not investigating this subject with the necessary force” .
"It has been reported that, due to the aging of the population of Macao, and in the light of the adoption of DAV legislation in the last twenty years in countries such as the United States, Australia, Canada and Singapore, the executive recognized the need to legislate DAV." , it is added.
The authors indicate that local authorities even recognize the positive factors of accessing this type of legal document. “Such legal instruments will not only increase quality of life and protect patients' dignity at the end of their lives, but also reduce unnecessary medical expenses. On December 3, 2019, Health Services (SS), and the sub -entity of the Life Science Ethics Committee, introduced the 'guidelines and future policy of the DAV' in Macao, agreeing to legitimize [a matter]. However, despite the agreement around the implementation of DAV, the executive insists on maintaining a preliminary discussions around DAV. ”
Thus, the authors consider that "hesitation may reflect the fear of the [SS] in facing difficulties and controversies around the plans for its implementation."
Consensus as an argument
The authors point out that the “barriers to the implementation” of the DAV legal framework in Macao arise “from a low conscience from the public in the face of DAV legislation and the possibility of patients can change the way of facing the end of life, well as the arrangement of the patient's family members to fulfill the patient's wishes ”.
The study stresses that the SS have always argued that “an extensive and profound action of sensitization and education with the public has been done in academic, social and legal areas whenever necessary, and that the law that regulates DAV can only be implemented later obtained the consensus of all sectors ”.
However, the study states that “it is possible to argue that the position of the executive lacks proper justification”, because “this type of consensus invoked to postpone the regulation of DAV is not possible to achieve, due to the multiplicity of legal, ethical visions and even religious about matter ”. In addition, the authors point out that "even if such a consensus could be achieved, the executive did not take the necessary steps to encourage or facilitate discussion, or awareness, with the population."
Data on a study made about the notions of the population of Macao on the subject are referred to, concluding that "the lack of information about the DAV was the main determining factor in the decision of people to make the DAV."
"The study also found that 73.6 percent of the sample (724 people) were willing to complete a DAV if the document had legal recognition."
Social and political “resistance”
Thus, the study's authors warn of the existence of “a great resistance - from certain groups of residents of Macao and the Executive - for the implementation of adequate DAV regulation”. "A possible reason for this hesitation is to the fear that formally legislating DAV can lead to euthanasia, a forbidden practice in Macau, even if the two situations are clearly different," the authors say, who understand to be "imperative that the executive regulates the DAV ”.
At this particular point, a new law should “clarify some legal aspects, such as the requirements for the [DAV] and to be legally operational”, ensuring the patient's decision autonomy and ensuring “a more appropriate solution from the point of view human rights ”.
The authors draw attention to the influence of Portuguese law of 2012 on the DAV legislation in Macao, drawing attention to the fact that DAV have a greater compatibility with what is currently in the local Civil Code.
However, legislating the DAV also causes a cultural discussion, is pointed out. “It is unclear whether DAV regulation would be in agreement with the widespread values ​​of the predominant Chinese community, which still has a great connection to the family. More studies are needed to clarify this and other subjects, since, for example, there are no data on numbers estimates and implementation of DAV in the jurisdiction of Macao ”, and there is“ an urgent need for further investigations that exploit perspectives of the doctors around the DAV ”.
The case of the Kiang Wu Hospital, which at the “The Hospice &amp; Palliative Care Center” palliative care center provides treatment for cancer terminal patients. However, before the admission of these patients, the signing of the document “Consent for the Hospice &amp; Palliative Care Center” is required, a kind of consent that is mostly signed by family members and not by the patient himself. In addition, "it is not an authorization document by patients, or not, of medical procedures, but an acceptance of hospital terms and conditions."
What current law allows
In general terms, DAV in Macau have some legal framework, namely in the Civil Code, although they are not legislated with their own law. The authors conclude, however, that "there is some uncertainty about to what extent DAV would be effective, in particular given that doctors tend to reject any document that rejects a support and life maintenance treatment."
“In Macau the discussion around the DAV is almost nonexistent. Without a clear and transparent debate that includes specialists and studies with legal arguments, there will be no legal developments related to the nature, content and use of DAV in the near future, ”he describes.</description><pubDate>2025-02-11 23:58:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Community neighborhoods | Government wants to install cartoons</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/bairros-comunitarios-governo-quer-instalar-desenhos-animados/</link><description>The government is negotiating with different companies the authorization to install different figures with cartoons in community neighborhoods, to attract more tourists.

The Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam, guaranteed yesterday that the public housing policy will have as a priority the construction of apartments T2 and T3. The promise was left yesterday in the Legislative Assembly, where he was answering the questions of the deputies.
"In the future public housing policy we will consider the construction of more dwellings T2 and T3," said Raymond Tam, after being confronted with the fact that these are the type of housing most sought after by the population.
The secretary acknowledged that currently part of the population living in economic housing has to deal with the fact that apartments sold if they have become too small with the growth of families. Economic housing is a type of housing sold to people at more affordable prices compared to those practiced on the market.
However, before you can advance with the construction of more houses, Raymond Tam acknowledged that the short -term solution will have to create a mechanism where families living in a T1 or T2 will be able to exchange for more rooms. “In the short term, to solve the problem, we can allow the exchange of fractions for the larger ones. It is a measure that can be taken in the short term and we expect to improve housing conditions in both social and economic housing, ”said Tam.
Social housing is another type of public housing for disadvantaged families, which are leased by the public administration with more affordable prices than those practiced in the private market.
Price Changes
Throughout the session, and with changes in the private market, where prices are increasingly cheaper, deputies such as Leong Sun IOK, linked to the Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom), suggested a reduction in economic housing prices.
"Currently, the price of private and public housing is practically the same, and this influences the desire to buy," said Leong. “Economic housing can only be sold in the market after 16 years, and at limited prices, so it should have affordable prices. I ask the government to make an assessment of the prices currently practiced, ”he said.
A similar request was presented by Deputy Ron Lam: "We have to take into account the situation of the real estate market that is also undergoing changes," he said.
In turn, Raymond Tam replied that the offer of housing in zone A of new landfills will take into account the changes in the market, and ensured that any changes are “being analyzed”.
Regarding the possibility of a permanent mechanism for buying economic housing, instead of residents are limited to the opening of competitions by the government, TAM promised that this will be the situation in the future. However, plans should take time to be implemented due to the lack of available houses.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 00:48:37</pubDate></item><item><title>APN | Sam Hou Fai met with representatives of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/apn-sam-hou-fai-reuniu-com-representantes-de-macau/</link><description>The Chief Executive organized a dinner to ask Macao representatives in the national organs who are the "good voice" of the territory.

Sam Hou Fai asked Macao deputies to the National People's Assembly (APN) and the members of Macao in the National Committee of the Chinese Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC) that are the “good voice” of the territory in both sessions, which are expected to take place nearby weeks. The two sessions are the annual meetings of APN and CCPPC and serve to present policies for this year, in areas such as economy, defense, commerce or diplomacy.
The Chief Executive's request was made during a dinner with Macao representatives in the national agencies, which took place on Wednesday night. In the Sam Hou Fai speech, he appealed to the representatives to present the advantages and needs of Macao “in the new development” to make a “greater contribution to the construction of a strong country”, “revitalization of the nation” and “Macao Progress”.
The leader of the local government also insisted on the need to promote “hengqin development” as well as ensuring “a better life of Macao residents”.
Sam Hou Fai also assured that the Government of MSar people pay “high tribute to all Macao deputies to APN and Macao members in the CCPPC National Committee for participation in the country's governance, promoting the development of Macao, for the reflection on feelings and opinions of the people and the congregation of patriotic love ”.

“China remains a major engine of world economic growth with good cooperation prospects with Portuguese -speaking countries,” said Ji Xianzheng at the Macao Forum New Year's reception.
China's economic growth reached in 2024 the 5 percent goal set by Beijing, but some analysts claim that the economy is expanding at a slower pace than indicated in official estimates.
In a report released on January 16, the World Bank predicted that the world economy is expected to grow 2.7 percent by 2025 and 2026 and said that slowdown in the United States and China is weighing on global growth.
In a speech, Ji Xianzheng said that "Macao's efforts" at the opening abroad "will certainly bring new opportunities for China and Portuguese -speaking countries in the face of deepening cooperation in various domains." In April last year, the Macao Forum held the sixth ministerial conference, during which a new action plan was approved by 2027, focused on new cooperation areas, such as the digital economy and the blue economy.
Despite the optimism, Ji Xianzheng stressed that “the promotion of a comprehensive cooperation of mutual benefits with Portuguese -speaking countries is pending the joint efforts of the ten countries” that are part of the Macao Forum. The organization has as members Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Timor-Leste, Sao Tome and Principe (since 2017) and Equatorial Guinea (since 2022).
Aligned government
The Macao Forum was established in 2003, the same year when Beijing designated the city as a platform for reinforcing economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries.
In the same ceremony, the chief executive of the region promised to “fully support” the organization, to take advantage of “the unique advantages” of the city and “effectively enhance Macau as an interlocutor between China and Portuguese -speaking countries”.
Sam Hou Fai has assured that Macau will “reinforce bilateral opening with Lusophone countries”, as well as “take a more open and inclusive posture to intensify international ties and increase global projection and attractiveness”. Sam Hou Fai, who took office on December 20, is the first leader of the Macao government who dominates the Portuguese language.</description><pubDate>2025-02-20 02:57:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | CE Alert for International Instability Risks</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/20/economia-ce-alerta-para-riscos-de-instabilidade-internacional/</link><description>The chief executive (CE) warned yesterday with the economic danger of the tariffs imposed by the White House to China and the effect on Macau's economy, very exposed abroad. At a meeting of the Economic Development Council, Sam Hou Fai says they are accurate answers to the challenges that the Chinese economy is going through
 
MSAR leader Sam Hou Fai yesterday launched an alert for difficult times that have been coming to Macao's economy during the first meeting of the Council for Economic Development. The chief executive began by claiming that the world is facing the acceleration of "great changes not seen in a century", with the entry "in a new period of turbulent changes."
The significant aggravation of unilateralism and protectionism in recent years added instability and uncertainty in the global economy, especially in Macao as "highly open micro-economic abroad," which "cannot be immune." In addition to highlighting the growing international competition to the main sector of the territory, Tourism, Sam Hou Fai stressed the increase in customs imposed customs rates by the United States (US) on Chinese imports. "The international strategy of the new US government and the uncertainty of policies in relation to China bring us a new negative impact."
Also at national level the panorama is not the most optimistic. "The economic functioning of our country continues to face many difficulties and challenges, continuing to confront certain respective pressures in particular to the insufficiency of domestic demand, the difficulties of producing and exploiting some companies, employment and increased resident performance," he said the government leader.
Roll of dependencies
Given the weaknesses pointed out, Sam Hou Fai claimed to be essential “redoubled attention and proper response, since Macau's economy has the pillar of the integrated tourism and leisure industry and is highly dependent on the market of visitors in the interior of China” .
The ruler again pointed to his finger to the structural imbalances of the local economy with the “exclusive development of the game sector as a single sector of the economy”, admitting that for “a certain period of time” it will be difficult to “substantially” change this scenario. Until then, "old problems such as scarcity of resources, a unique structure of sources of tourists, imbalance of financial revenues and insufficient innovation ability to resolve more effectively."
The chief executive also pointed out that the economy of Macao is “in a crucial phase of transition from a recovery development to high quality development” and requested the contribution of the members of the Council to economic development.
However, Sam Hou Fai is confident that "in the long run the economy of the interior of China and the country's economy ship will certainly sail in the wind and break the waves for a brighter future." To circumvent economic difficulties, the ruler pointed to the fulfillment of the objectives set by the central government for the MSAR, not defrauding the expectations of President XI Jinping to the territory.
"The great homeland is always our firm support and, 'support of the country and interconnection with the world' are undoubtedly the greatest advantages of MSAR," said Sam Hou Fai.</description><pubDate>2025-02-20 01:43:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Sam Hou Fai and Wu Sui</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/sam-hou-fai-e-wu-sui/</link><description>Everyone knows who Sam Hou Fai is, but Wu Sui, does anyone know who it is? I believe not only most Portuguese, but also many Chinese have never heard this name. However, in Chinese society, especially in Macao where popular beliefs are preserved, Wu Sui is an important figure because it is an “guardian deity” of the year of the serpent, responsible for supervising the happiness and misfortune of the human world.
Wu Sui was born in China 800 years ago during the Song Dynasty and served as a magistrate in Xuning County. During his mandate, Wu Sui exposed many hidden crimes and the neighboring neighbors often sought their help and advice to solve difficult cases. One year, there was a great drought and Wu Sui prayed in the temple for three days and three nights and ended up raining. To relieve the drought's impact on the people, Wu decreed the tax reduction and the rental of the land, providing help to 48,000 victims of this disaster. At that time, more than 400,000 refugees from other affected areas crossed the river to Xiuning and Wu Sui did all possible to help them. While other cities were immersed in chaos due to incidents of agitation, set fire, and withdrawals motivated by drought, the areas governed by Wu Sui remained peaceful and orderly, without anyone creating any problem. Therefore, it is not without reason that popular tradition elected Wu as the guardian divinity in the year of the serpent.
Due to the current complex and constantly changing international developments, it is believed that 2025 will be a year that happens once in every century and will have to face great challenges. Although crises and opportunities are hand in hand, not all leaders know how to “recognize change”, “respond to change” and “seek change”. Recently, Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao work office and the Hong Kong and Macao affairs office with the Council of State, visited the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Hengqin, the cooperation zone and Technological and scientific innovation of Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong (Hetao Cooperation Zone), Modern Service Industry Zone between Qianhai district in Shenzhen and Hong Kong and the port of Yantian, where he was deeply involved in talks with employees responsible to strengthen cooperation between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau and to promote the best integration of these cities in the Great Guangdong-Macau Bay.
Hong Kong and Macao, in conjunction with Guangzhou and Shenzhen, were once seen as the four engines of the development of the Great Guangdong-Macau Bay. However, due to several factors, Hong Kong is still in the “transition from stability to prosperity” while “1+4” diversification in Macau is, for now, in an embryonic phase. If the Government of the MSAR cannot deal with cautious diversification, it will not be able to produce synergies in the Great Guangdong-Macau Bay, but, on the contrary, the status of Macao will endangered as a potential international financial center and as a center World Tourism and Leisure World. Therefore, director Xia is very concerned about the future development of Hong Kong and Macao.
Since Sam Hou Fai took office as chief executive, it is believed that his habit of “streets” has been changed, becoming more complicated for him to learn about the difficulties that the local population faces every day, related to The lack of employment and the closure of stores due to the breach of consumption. In addition to the fall in property prices, the cost of living is constantly increasing and radio programs are often heard from people asking the social risk value and old age pension to be increased. The beautiful idea of ​​“integration of Macao and Hengqin” cannot improve the current living level of short -term Macao residents. In the next lines of governing governing for the financial year of 2025, I sincerely hope that the government is actually concerned with the issues with which citizens have to deal with daily.
Sam Hou Fai passed from the judge of the last court, the Chief Executive, while Wu Sui moved as a magistrate to be a guardian deity of the popular tradition. However, both were confronted with the challenge of finding solutions to relieve the difficulties that people have to face.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 01:31:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Geogostronomy and the role of Portuguese cuisine in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/20/a-geogastronomia-e-o-papel-da-gastronomia-portuguesa-em-macau/</link><description>“Macau’s Food Culture is a fascinating amalgamation of flavors Brought together by centuries of trade and colonial Rule. The Portuguese influence is particularly evident in dishes that combine local ingredients with techniques and recipes brought from Portugal. ”
Macau’s Culinary Delights: Portuguese and Chinese Fusion
BARKER, Anthony
The intersection between geography and gastronomy, designated by geogostronomy, illustrates the significant influence of the place on culinary practices. Macau's Portuguese cuisine encompasses a unique mixture of culinary traditions, innovative practices and cultural exchanges that evolved from Portuguese influences and local ingredients. At the heart of Macanese cuisine is its historical framing. The gastronomic identity of Macao emerges from historical ties with Portugal, especially from the mid -16th century. The Portuguese presence in Asia began a cultural and culinary exchange that led to the development of unique dishes. This connection has established a platform for the culinary exchange not only between Portuguese and Chinese kitchens, but also with flavors from other regions, such as India and Southeast Asia. Thus, the origins of Macanese cuisine can be attributed to this intercultural integration, shaped by the availability of local ingredients and the migration of peoples.
The introduction of ingredients such as turmeric, chilli and potatoes transformed the local kitchen. Traditional Portuguese recipes were adapted to local tastes and available resources, thus creating a distinct culinary hybrid. During the period of colonization, the Portuguese in Macao established a vibrant commercial port, facilitating trade between Europe and Asia.
This trade brought not only exotic ingredients, but also several culinary techniques that formed the backbone of Macau's cuisine. The mixture of flavors of Portuguese, Chinese and Asian influences contributed to the richness of Macao's culinary supply. Macau's cuisine scene has been shaped by several chefs that have been at the forefront of promoting traditional Portuguese dishes cast with local influences. Its approach exemplifies the culmination of Portuguese culinary traditions and local ingredients, resulting in innovative dishes that appeal to both locations and tourists.
In addition, historians and gastronomic critics have played a crucial role in the documentation and promotion of the history of Portuguese cuisine in Macau. Its investigation provides valuable information on the evolution of culinary practices, helping to preserve heritage and ensure its future relevance. Geogostronomy analyzes the way geographical and cultural contexts shape food practices. In Macao, this perspective is evident in the cooking fusion that defines the region. Several traditional Portuguese dishes have been adapted using local seasonings, creating a unique version that reflects the identity of Macau and cannot be considered a copy or tampering.
The influence of local spices and culinary techniques also led to the onset of macanese dishes, such as “Pork Chop Bun”, called the “Macanese version of the hamburger” and derived from “Bifana” and “African Chicken”, which is derived from the “Chicken to Piri Piri” that show the mixture of flavors and traditions. The role of spices in Macanese cuisine cannot be underestimated. The Portuguese settlers brought with them a wide variety of spices from their colonies, including black pepper, cinnamon and cloves. These flavors mingled with Chinese indigenous ingredients, giving rise to unique dishes that reflect both inheritances. For example, one of the most famous macanese dishes is Cod to Brás, a cod dish that integrates Portuguese techniques with local flavors such as garlic and onion. Another remarkable dish is the iconic Macaense Caril, which features Portuguese influences infused with spices that resemble Indian cuisine.
The introduction of new cooking methods is an important aspect of this merger. Traditional Portuguese cuisine often involves techniques such as grilling, stewing and baking. These methods have been harmoniously mixed with Chinese methods, such as frying and steaming, creating a kitchen that is as diverse in preparation as in taste. Douts like the “Cabydela Duck”, a plate of duck in vinegar and served with rice, exemplify this mixture. The use of rice itself is noteworthy, as it is a basic food in both cultures, often prepared with techniques that enhance its flavor, such as frying with garlic before boiling.
The adaptation of these dishes demonstrates the dynamic nature of culinary practices in response to geographical and cultural factors. The role of Portuguese cuisine goes beyond mere culinary practices; It plays a significant role in the formation of cultural identity and the economic development of Macao. The region's rich cooking supply has become a vital part of its tourist industry. Tourists looking for authentic experiences are often attracted to local restaurants that serve traditional Luso-Macaenses, thus supporting companies and the economy.
In addition, the culinary landscape gained international recognition, with Macao receiving the title of UNESCO gastronomy city on October 31, 2017. This designation underlines the importance of preserving culinary heritage, simultaneously promoting its cultural meaning and its innovation potential. Highlights the need for sustainable practices in tourism and gastronomy sectors, ensuring that Macao's unique flavors continue to prosper. In recent years, Macao's culinary scene has recorded significant changes due to Covid-19 pandemic, globalization and the alteration of consumer preferences.

The contents of the new law are simple, but from an operational point of view, there are many issues that deserve to be discussed.
The two main questions are as follows, in the first place, neither infrastructors nor their legal guardians are not penalized in the light of the new law, the penalty is only about companies that generate social networks. This approach can lead to disputes on the attribution of responsibility when put into practice.
Secondly, the new law requires companies that generate social networks to take measures to verify the age of users. However, the new law clearly stipulates that users cannot carry in these platforms the identification documents, which makes the correct determination of their age difficult. A goal spokesman stated that Facebook respects Australian law, but is concerned about the process adopted, as it considers that the law was accelerated to ensure the interdiction of children's access to social networks without being heard to different opinions on the subject.
Since currently there is no more effective method to prevent children from using social networks, to solve the problem, the Australian government has stated that it would adopt the “age certification system”. It is planned to invite 1,200 Australian citizens to take an age evaluation test, and a consulting firm will implement recommendations in the middle of this year. This will be one of the largest tests with age assessment technology ever performed. If successful, it will become an important reference indicator for legislative agencies and technological platforms around the world to detect the age of users of social networks. It will be a highly representative global model and will be congratulated.
But if it fails, will Australia have an alternative plan to enforce the new law? Although not mentioned in the news, from the point of view of public administration, it would be complicated to have a completely new computer system of unknown effectiveness to deal with the social problems arising from the access of children under 16 to social networks, the which is undoubtedly a risk. If prepared for both scenarios Australia will be easier to implement the new law.
When it is necessary to verify the age of the users, the most effective method is through the presentation of identity cards, passports, etc. In Australia this method is not legal, possibly because photos and identification data are personal information and involve privacy protection issues. When companies that generate social networks receive accurate information, they can correctly determine the age of users, but at the same time, as they have access to many data from users, they have to treat them carefully. In light of the new law, companies that generate social networks can avoid these problems because they will not have to process the personal data of users, and they do not need to worry about the possibility of their data being disclosed, stolen or sold by third parties .
Moreover, in relation to the practical and operational aspects of the new law, there is another issue that is concerned with online game. The children under 16 are students of basic education. Young people in this age group have no self-control and self-preservation capacity yet and easily addicted to the online universe. They are very dependent on social networking platforms and online games. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that excessive use of social networks is a risk to the physical and mental health of children and that legislation should be introduced to control this risk. If Australia has passed legislation to protect the physical and mental health of children under 16, is the next step prevent them from playing online?
On October 25, 2019, the management of the Press and Publications of Continental China issued the “National Press Administration Warning and Publications for Prevention of Addiction in Online Games among the Minors”, stipulating that all online game companies can only Have games available on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. These days, the games are available for one hour from 20.00 to 21.00, and no service will be available at other times. This regulation was actually applied in mainland China.
On the other hand, South Korea passed a law in 2011 to restrict access from under 16 to online play between 22.30 and 6.00, but the law was very contested and was eventually repealed because it did not respect the rights of younger people .
The new Australian law recognizes the risks that social networks pose for children's physical and mental health. If young people start using social networks too early, they are subject to adverse consequences such as depression, harassment, anxiety and weak academic results. If you continue to evolve into “internet addiction”, it will be even more serious and inevitable to legislate. The question of restricting children's access to online games can be seen as continuing the restriction of children's access to social networks and can be treated in the same way. The experience of mainland China in this area may be valuable to other countries.
Hong Kong and Macao currently have no legislation that regulates access from under 16 to social networks or online game platforms. Do we need legislation to regulate these issues? The new Australian law is a warning to remind us of this problem. What should we do? Each of these regions can conduct an in -depth investigation and decide according to their conclusions.
Next week we will have a new theme.

Poorly comparative was what happened to Finance Minister Miranda Sarmento, against his infrastructure and housing counterpart, Miguel Pinto Luz, in the case of suspension of income allowance to more than 80,000 people living in trouble. Without any notice, the Tax and Customs Authority versus finance, with all cruelty, suspended the income subsidy of about 200 euros, a measure decreed by the previous government for a period of five years and began in 2023.
Minister Pinto Luz, who has the protection of the Institute of Housing and Urban Rehabilitation (IHRU) - an institution that was limited to pay according to the green light received by finances during the last two years - was obliged, confronted by deputies in the Assembly of the Republic, apologizing to the injured. Who had to apologize to the Portuguese affected with such ungrateful measure was the Minister of Finance. Obviously, the injured injured revolt fell on top of Ihru who was not even prepared for such a significant contestation and doesn't even have enough employees to face lines of people who have been at the door of IHRU. service for hours standing.
Prime Minister Luís Montenegro has claimed to all the winds that governs for people. We think your people are friends and compadres, because the millions of poor people in our country of certainty that they do not fit into their governance. It was very evident for those who Montenegro rules. On January 1, 2023, its predecessor António Costa took one of the most human and supportive measures of Portuguese politics in democracy.
It decreed that about 200,000 poor, families who lived in great survival difficulties and who could not pay home income, began to enjoy for five years of approximate income of 200 euros, to help pay income. , after the finances they find through the IRs which citizens need to help, which came to happen automatically. Now we have watched, without any notice, to the government cut of this income subsidy to more than 85,000 people. These people, who had this sin to make the income payment and who, once again, were missing before their landlords. A measure full of cruelty and inhumanity.
The Institute of Housing and Urban Rehabilitation (IHRU) knew perfectly perfectly that the State Budget has captivated the amount of 300 million euros for the payment of income subsidies to about 200 thousand poor Portuguese. The institute would never admit that this case would happen without warning in advance. Even so, the finances did not curb the infamy of cutting the income subsidy so necessary for thousands of unprotected Portuguese. The IHRU, which was the paying institution, was immediately targeted by the greatest criticism in the media and the Assembly of the Republic, where a deputy vented to be a "cretinice".
In the face of the protests, IHRU issued a statement indicating that from the beginning of last week, people who were impaired would have an application on the IHRU website where they could confirm their income data from the Finance Portal and insert their own complaint. This application was not made available to the vast majority of injuries and IHRU was forced to turn off its only phone number where people could request information about what had happened to their income subsidies due to the large avalanche of calls telephone calls .
The infamous decision of the finance covered Portuguese throughout the national territory. However, the almost general injured man had no solution vector and, in Lisbon, injured ones began to know that the only solution would be personally moving to the IHRU premises near Spain's square in order to be attended to the problem.
It should be noted that among the despised people and stolen by the government, include citizens and citizens who are invisual, disabled, old and who are all impossible to go to the IHRU headquarters. No longer talking about the thousands of injuries who do not have any internet access, who have no computer to be able to consult the IHRU website or the finance portal, which encloses total contempt for these people.
A very poor, 79-year-old, resident in the Moscavide neighborhood, without internet access, was advised to personally move to IHRU headquarters. The citizen left home at 07.00 hours, picked up the train at East Station to Roma-Areiro, moved along three lines of the metropolitan, green, red and blue, rose dozens of stairs because the rollingmen and elevators they were damaged. He felt bad and sat on a bench in the garden of Spain Square near Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro Avenue where the headquarters of Ihru is located. At 9.05 hours he entered the superbo building of eight floors and on the counter they transmitted it, dry and coldly: "There are no vacancies, come back at 14.00 hours!". The citizen looked at the small waiting room and were sitting around twenty people. Eight floors to serve 20 people each morning? Ah… there are many other services in IHRU and employees have more to do…
But who created this ungrateful mess were the finances and the revolt fell over IHRU and the institute was not prepared for the reaction of more than 85,000 people… The citizen concerned returned to Moscavide by the same way and at noon left again On the same way to the headquarters of IHRU, hoping that his problem of removing his income subsidy would be resolved, as his income from last year for this year had not increased Not a euro. Dealde. At 14.00 hours there were no passwords. Poor man who returned to Moscavide and gave up risking some heart attack after so much effort.
Is this to rule for people? Is this the public function and service? Is this what the people deserve? Is this the finance service that does not waste time penalizing a Portuguese that is late in the payment of any tax? Is this to rule for people? Is this, protecting the most unprotected from the nation? Is this, a way to make people believe in politicians? This is this, which causes the people to manifest themselves in the polls that are fed up with cruel and liars and tend to vote for President of the Republic in a man like Admiral Gouveia and Melo.

"The argument was so good, not even needed prior preparation," said the actor, at a press conference of the series in which Lusa participated. “The dialogue was excellent. It might have been pier, pretentious or biased, but in this case I wouldn't be here. ”
“Day Zero” was filmed over seven months in New York, with Robert de Niro being critical to this location. "For some time I had spoken to my agent about doing anything in New York," said the actor, who is also a six -episode miniseries producer.
The cast includes Angela Bassett, Matthew Modine, Jesse Plemons, Lizzy Caplan, Connie Britton and Joan Allen.
Created by Eric Newman (“Griselda”, “Narcos: Mexico”), Noah Oppenheim (former president of NBC News) and Michael Schmidt (journalist), the miniseries departs from a massive cyberataque that turns off in the United States for a minute and causes chaos and thousands of dead.
Robert De Niro plays former President George Mullen, called by current President Evelyn Mitchell (Angela Bassett) to preside over a committee to which unheard of investigation powers are given. The director Lesli Linka Glatter ("West Wing", "Homeland") described the series as "a paranoic conspiracy thriller."
"The idea came from conversations about our relationship with the truth," said Eric Newman at the conference. "It's something global: we have entered a post-truth age where truths can be mutually exclusive."  One of Mullen's antagonists is the author of a podcast, Evan Green (Dan Stevens) who plays with suspicions and throws accusations without proof to monetize the hearing's ultrasound.
"Green represents the bangs that operates around a story like this," said the actor. "He is annoying, a divisive figure who thrives with division and makes it his coin." But the argument does not take a position and none of the interveners comes out particularly well, with a varied range of doubtful decisions, except for former President Sheila Mullen's wife, who maintains integrity.
"What we hope that people will take this is that, although the mechanisms by which we determine the truth can be broken, perhaps irreparably, it is still possible to do the right thing," said Newman. "Although it is a disconcerting view of humanity, in the end there is a certain optimism and hope."
Cocriador Noah Oppenheim said the team started working in this story several years ago and that it is amazing to see how what has happened in the real world mirrors the chaos that the series portrays. "If we think about the threats we face, be it cybership, climate change or nuclear war, the largest of all is the inability to agree with a shared set of facts," he said.
Angela Bassett, who plays President Mitchell, stressed the importance of “seeing this representation of a woman” as the actress “in a place of power in the oval room”, something that excited her to do the series, besides being the second time to work with de niro.
Also Connie Britton, who gives body to Valerie Whitesell, found the humanization of highly political situations interesting, which often forget that behind power positions are human beings with complex relationships and personalities. "This shows us how our choices can have an impact on everyone," he said while the characters try to maintain decorum and respect the high positions.
"These acts of balance are what we do in real life, even if we are not in high risk espionage or cybership," he continued. "We are all trying to find a balance between our responsibilities and intimate relationships."</description><pubDate>2025-02-20 19:00:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong and Moma M+ Museum sign first collaboration</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/20/museu-m-de-hong-kong-e-moma-assinam-primeira-colaboracao/</link><description>The Hong Kong M+ Museum has signed a collaboration agreement with the New York Modern Art Museum (MoMA), the first of the genre between the US institution and an Asian counterpart.

M+ assured the newspaper that on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding with MoMA, to promote cooperation in areas such as research, curators exchange, conservation, programs and talent development.
The partnership takes place in the midst of the deterioration of Beijing and Washington, exacerbated by the return to the US Presidency on January 20, from Donald Trump, which imposed an additional 10% tariff on Hong Kong imports and mainland China China imports .
Founded in 1929, MoMA houses a collection of nearly 200,000 pieces, which includes striking paintings in art history such as 'The Night Star Dark' by Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890), and 'Les Demoiselles d'Avignon', by Pablo Picasso (1881-1973).
Picasso in Raehk
From March 15 to July 13, M+ will host the exhibition 'Picasso For Asia: The Conversation', which brings together more than 60 works by the Spanish artist, considered one of the most prolific and influential creators of the twentieth century. M+joint curatorship, located in the West Kowloon Cultural District, and the Musée National Picasso-Paris in France, this exhibition will be the first to display masterpieces from the Parisian museum alongside pieces from a museum collection in Asia.
Among the prominent works that will be transported to the former British colony are 'The Acrobat' (1930), 'Figures by the Seaside' (1931), 'Great Great Nature with Pedestal Table' (1931), '' Portrait of Dora Maar '(1937) or' Massacre in Korea '(1951).
The Hong Kong government pointed to the recovery of tourism as essential for the economy of the Chinese semi -autonomous region. Authorities said the organization of this exhibition represents an important step in restoring the city's cultural landscape and attracting visitors from around the world. The Hong Kong executive revealed a five -year tourist development plan, with the aim of almost duplicating the sector's contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), from 2.6% in 2024 to about 5% by 2029.
The plan, presented at the end of December by the Secretary for Culture, Sport and Tourism, Rosanna Law Shuk-Pui, includes the implementation of 133 measures focused on the creation of projects that highlight the city's local and international characteristics.
Rosanna Law was appointed in early December by executive head John Lee Ka-Chiu at the first remodeling of the Hong Kong government, a neighboring city of Macau, since the former deputy commissioner of the police took office in July 2022, in the middle of pandemic.</description><pubDate>2025-02-20 18:54:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinema | “Nezha 2” surpasses “Inside Out 2” at the box office</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/20/cinema-nezha-2-ultrapassa-inside-out-2-em-bilheteira/</link><description>The Chinese animation movie “Nezha 2” exceeded the movie “Inside Out 2” (Pixar) and became the longest-and-box animation feature in history, the Chinese press said yesterday.
With a global revenue of 12.3 billion Yuan, the film is also the eighth cinematic work with the highest box office of all time, according to the Yicai news portal. The success of “Nezha 2” is particularly remarkable for its origin, with more than 99 percent of revenues to come exclusively from China, unlike Hollywood productions, which depend strongly on international distribution.
This sequel, which follows the story of “Nezha” (2019), is inspired by the sixteenth-century Chinese classic novel “The Investiture of the Gods”, which tells the adventures of a boy with magical powers that defends the Frequent City of Chentangguan.
Launched on January 29, during the Lunar New Year, “Nezha 2” led the daily box office in China for 21 consecutive days, contributing significantly to the increase of the national box office. The phenomenon of this feature film led to an extension of the debut in movie theaters until March 30.
Nezha's legacy as an iconic character of the Chinese animation will be honored at a special session on March 18 in Shanghai, where “Nezha conquers the Dragon King” (1979) and “Nezha 2” will be shown.
This event will bring together two generations of spectators and will offer a perspective on the evolution of Chinese animation in the last four decades, as well as the continuity of myth in popular culture. Held by Yang Yu (known as Jiaozi), from Sichuan Province (Center of China), “Nezha 2” reflects the growing presence of Chinese animation films in the international film industry.</description><pubDate>2025-02-20 02:39:17</pubDate></item><item><title>JLL estimates that housing will continue to lose value throughout the year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/jll-estima-que-habitacoes-vao-continuar-a-perder-valor-ao-longo-do-ano/</link><description>Real estate agency JLL estimates that this year the value of housing will fall up to 5 percent, according to the latest report on the Macao market.
The breaks, which can reach 5 percent, were estimated for both luxury housing, which in 2024 devalued 11.4 percent, and for medium and small value houses, which in 2024 lost 9.7 of its value . “House prices in Macao have fallen from the pandemic, with global prices descending more than 20 percent from the peak of the market. Some units have even registered descents of 30 percent, ”said Mark Wong, JLL's value and risk consulting director in Macao.
Real Estate Agency admits that resale housing buyers have lost money: “Price correction in the housing market has led to substantial losses for apartment owners who have bought residential apartments in recent years, which has also affected their interests in Invest or just buy housing. In addition, despite a proper housing offer, demand continues to be limited, ”he was pointed out.
Other devaluation
Offices should also lose value throughout this year, with JLL predicting reductions that can, as in housing, reach 5 percent, in terms of the market as a whole, which devalued 10.9 percent in 2024, and of the luxury offices, which devalued 8 percent.
JLL also perspected reductions that can reach 5 percent in terms of commercial spaces, after indicating that stores were shortened by 9.4 percent over the past year.
Despite providing widespread devaluation, JLL believes that in terms of the lease market, there should be a slight climb in housing rents, which may increase up to 13.7 percent in the luxury segment and 2.5 percent in the other segments.
In the offices, it is expected that the rents will drop between 4.5 and 6.0 percent, while in stores the maintenance of the value is expected.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 01:18:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Lai chi vun | Urbanist disagree with dike construction</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/lai-chi-vun-urbanista-discorda-de-construcao-de-diques/</link><description>Lam Iek Chit does not see reasons to build dikes against floods at Lai Chi Vun shipyards. In addition to cutting the connection with the sea, and violating the zone classification regulation, the terrain has a slope for water, functioning as a natural barrier. The work was awarded to Nam Kwong by 565 million patacas
 
The construction of “flood prevention equipment and reordering the water drainage system in the dikes and Shizimen canal” will soon begin to prevent flooding in the immediate vicinity of the Avenida de October of Colaane, Coloane and Cais de Colaane and from lai chi vun.
The work motivated some criticism, including the urban planner and a member of the Lam Iek Chit Cultural Heritage Council, who says he has complained on different occasions for the conflict between and the works projected and the administrative regulation on the classification of Lai Chi Naval Shipters VUN. However, it never obtained response from the authorities.
Speaking to the Cheng Pou newspaper, the urban planner recalls that the administrative regulation provides for the establishment of a protective zone in Lai Chi Vun, which requires the maintenance of the characteristics of the Rio and the natural landscape. According to Lam Iek Chit, these characteristics will be concerned with the construction that will imply cutting the connection between the shipyards and the sea.
The government states that the work is essential to mitigate the problems of floods located on the west side of Coloane caused by storm tides and heavy rains.
The Law of Gravity
The urban planner considers that the government has easier, effective and much cheaper solutions to protect Lai Chi Vun dwellings against storm tides and heavy rains. The simple installation of barriers or protections in houses is a solution presented by LAM, without large expenses for the public purse and without violating the administrative regulation and the protection law of cultural heritage. In addition, the very characteristics of the place, with a slope to the sea, form a protection for the houses in the immediate vicinity, unlike in Vila de Coloane. Still, the urban planner understands that in the village of Coloane the installation of barriers in homes would also be sufficient to prevent floods, or from a more cautious perspective the construction of a dike.
In addition to these issues, Lam Iek Chit says the government has not published scientific data on flood protection plans at different levels. According to the work of the work, the company NAM Kwong Union Commercial and Industrial gained the award of the project, with a price of 565 million patacas and a period of completion of 710 working days.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 01:13:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Islands Hospital | Creation of tour packages under study</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/hospital-das-ilhas-criacao-de-pacotes-turisticos-em-estudo/</link><description>The Islands Hospital is “conducting preliminary market studies on the content of medical tourism packages, its criteria for charging fees,” said the director of health services, Alvis Lo, in response to a Ho Ion Sang interpellation .

Last year, about 130,000 elderly people received the 9,000 patacas allowance
 
The government of Sam Hou Fai will study the possibility of adjusting the amounts of social supports intended for the elderly, such as the subsidy and pension for the elderly. The guarantee was given by the president of the Institute of Social Action (IAS), Hon Wai, in response to a written interpellation of Nick Law.
Regarding the pension for the elderly, which has maintained in 3,740 monthly patacas since the beginning of 2020, and the installments of the Social Security regime, the Social Security Fund (FSS) will study its adaptation “to social development”, to “ respond to the real needs of residents. ” To optimize the regular benefit adjustment mechanism and the indexing of the base of the pension for the elderly to the value of social risk, Hon Wai indicated that “the financial situation of the FSS itself, socioeconomic development” and the results of the evaluation of the 'Elderly Consumer Price Index' ”.
Regarding the subsidy for the elderly, whose value of 9,000 patacas has not been reviewed since 2018, the government indicates that “in the future”, “will consider the possibility of adjusting the amount in accordance with society's economic situation, budgetary provisions and the various social support measures ”.
Ho wai also points out that since its implementation, the elderly allowance has risen 7.5 times “from 1,200 patacas in 2005 to 9,000 patacas in 2024”, a value that remains unchanged in the last six years. Last year, the allowance was distributed on October 17 to 130,641 beneficiaries, and had an approximate global value of over 1.175 billion.

The president of IAS also stressed other benefits for the elderly contemplated in the MSAR social support network, such as monetary reimbursement, health valleys, extraordinary office of budget balances, free medical assistance and free public transport, which guarantee “basic protection at various levels of everyday life ”.
Regarding the older population in financial difficulties, Hon Wai indicated that the government "established a regular mechanism to support families who do not have enough economic resources to meet basic needs."

According to official data, the number of tourists who passed through the territory was only exceeded by August, which recorded more than 3.65 million visitors. However, according to the direction of statistics and census services, more than 59 percent of visitors (2.16 million) arrived on organized excursions and spent less than one day in the city.
In 2024, the central government released a series of measures to support Macau, such as the increase in the tax exemption limit of goods for personal use acquired by visitors from China. At the same time, Chinese authorities widened 10 other cities in China the list of places with “individual visas” to visit Hong Kong and Macau.
Also, since January 1 that residents of the neighboring city of Zhuhai can visit Macau once a week and stay up to seven days. As a result, the overwhelming majority (91.3 percent) of tourists who arrived in Macao in January came from mainland China or Hong Kong, while only 241,000 were international visitors.
An almost record
January was close to setting a new record, despite the number of people who visited Macau during the so -called Golden Week of the Lunar year was 3.5 percent lower than in the same period of holidays of 2024.
According to data from the Macao Public Security Police, between January 28 and February 4, 1.31 million tourists entered the region, a daily average of 163,700.
On January 17, Macau's Director of Tourism Services (STD), Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, said she expected a daily average of 185,000 visitors during the 'Golden Week'. On the same day, Senna Fernandes said Portugal could help Macau attract more visitors from the rest of Europe.
The leader gave as an example the semi -sectional meeting of the European Confederation of Travel Agency Associations and Tour Operators (ECTAA), which will be held in Macao in June.
“It was through APAVT [Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies] that we were presented to ECTAA,” said Senna Fernandes. "Although it will have less than 100 people, they represent 80,000 travel agencies from all over Europe in all," said the leader.
Senna Fernandes also said he hopes that Macau could receive between 38 and 39 million visitors this year.
In August, the leader pointed to more than three million international visitors in 2025.
Macau received last year 34.9 million visitors, 23.8 percent than the previous year, but still far from the 39.4 million record set in 2019, before the pandemic.</description><pubDate>2025-02-20 18:48:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism | STD seeks to consolidate Hong Kong Market</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/20/turismo-dst-procura-consolidar-mercado-de-hong-kong/</link><description>The Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) will launch this year a series of promotions in Hong Kong to expand and consolidate this market, after the 8.9 percent break of visitors from the neighboring region during the holidays of the Lunar New Year of this year.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us around the house, pies us his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on violations in Ukraine in this “special operation”), an act that he forced us to watch, and then we tell him: High There we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You haven't said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - Madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unambiguous moral implication in the phrase “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is managed to seek a reason for Things abroad to us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicidou -If and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ that had not entered the story. »
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when you announced the Nobel Prize in this year's literature, I couldn't help but remember this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, compared to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large newspaper Daily National Wrote wrote Five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize of Literature was awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete unknown. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners - I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example - but that only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone is He knows and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from him.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I also preferred that in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have been awarded. Les années ”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday an article came out in Maputo's morning “News”, to realize that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho Award Coast.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification as to their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timothy should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but to be highlighted simply that we "we do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”).

This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible?

There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »

Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people, who always seems the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters At eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).

“China follows its people -centered philosophy. It is a necessary choice to safeguard the common interests of the region's countries and respond to aspirations shared by their peoples, ”said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun at a press conference.
Guo stressed that China maintains close bilateral and multilateral cooperation with Thailand, Myanmar and other affected countries.
“We took several measures to solve both symptoms and the deep causes of these crimes and work together to prevent criminals from crossing borders, with the aim of eradicating the problem of illegal online fraud and gambling,” he said.
The spokesman added that China will continue to take steps to “protect people's life and goods” and preserve exchange and cooperation with countries in the region.
However, it avoided giving details about the identity of repatriated citizens, their health or the circumstances of their rescue. "For specific information, I refer to the competent authorities in China," he said.
Thailand yesterday began the repatriation of thousands of people, mostly Chinese citizens, who had been taken by criminal groups and exploited in centers dedicated to online fraud on Myanmar.
The first of the planes took off yesterday with 50 passengers on board, although it is expected that a total of 1,041 Chinese will be sent to his country among the 7,000 foreigners to repact in the coming days, according to the estimate made by the Thai Prime Minister this week , Paetongtarn Shinawatra.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 01:35:05</pubDate></item><item><title>China | Synthesized a hexagonal diamond harder than the natural</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/china-sintetizado-um-diamante-hexagonal-mais-duro-que-o-natural/</link><description>A team of Chinese researchers was able to synthesize Lonsdaleita, a rare form of hexagonal diamond with a hardness 40 percent higher than the natural diamond.
The discovery was made by scientists at the University of Jilin and Sun Yat-Sen University, China Daily said on Wednesday. The development group recently pointed out that Lonsdaleita was obtained from graffiti submitted to extreme pressure and temperature conditions.
"The synthesis of Lonsdaleita has been a focal point of research for scientists around the world over the past 50 years," said Yao Mingguang, professor at the University of Jilin State Superduct Materials Laboratory. Lonsdaleita, discovered in 1967, is naturally formed in places of impact of meteorites, although its artificial synthesis was a challenge for the scientific community.
To achieve it, Chinese researchers applied pressure of 300,000 atmospheres, six times higher than necessary to make conventional diamonds. As a result, they obtained crystals up to 1.2 mm in diameter, a size considerably larger than those obtained in previous attempts.
In addition to its exceptional hardness, synthesized Lonsdaleita displays remarkable thermal stability, remaining stable up to 1,100 ° C. “Newly synthesized diamonds have thermal stability and remain stable at extreme temperatures,” explained Yao.
This feature may allow its application to ultra-resistant and semiconductor materials. Despite the progress, industrial production is not yet viable: “Finding appropriate catalysts can make way for it,” said the investigator. The team now seeks to optimize the process to move from laboratory synthesis to manufacture in large volume.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 01:27:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Deepseek | Discarded opening to more investors</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/deepseek-descartada-abertura-a-mais-investidores/</link><description>The Chinese Artificial Intelligence Company (IA) DeepSeek yesterday denied that it is considering the possibility of accepting external financing to face the growing demand for computational resources after its rapid growth.

The agencies mentioned Chinese investment funds and the National Social Security Fund as possible investors. They are “just rumors,” the company said yesterday in a statement.
The state newspaper The Paper also reported yesterday that the company is facing difficulties to sustain the expansion of the service, which led its directors and their mother company, Quantcube, to evaluate a strategy change that would guide their focus from Technological Research for a commercially viable model.
In recent days, it has been speculated on a possible investment of $ 10 billion from the Alibaba group, which would give him a 10 percent participation in the company and evaluate DeepSek by $ 100 billion.

This indicator, established as a reference for interest rates in 2019, is used to set the price of new loans - usually intended for companies - and loans the variable rate that are being reimbursed.
It is calculated based on the price contributions of a set of banks - including small creditors that tend to have higher financing costs and higher mischief - and aims to lower loan costs and support the “real economy”.
The last reduction was in October last year, when the Central Bank reduced it to 25 base points from 3.35 percent.

Inflation in the Chinese Semiautonoma region of Hong Kong accelerated in January, for the first time since August, due to transportation and food prices during the holidays of the Lunar New Year, was announced yesterday.
The Consumer Price Index (IPC) rose 2 percent in January, compared to the same period, said the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department (CSD). In December, inflation settled at 1.4 percent.
In a statement, the CSD justified the acceleration, the first in five months, with "the price increases in round trip transportation and background and basic food prices due to the effect of the Chinese New Year."
The Lunar New Year, the largest mass movement in the world, is the main traditional party of Chinese families and takes place in January or February, depending on the lunar calendar. This year, he celebrated between January 28 and February 4.
The CSD also stressed that a 10 percent increase in the income of most residents in public housing in Hong Kong, a neighboring city of Macau.
A territory government spokesman argued that underlying consumer price inflation was modest in January and added that, overall, food prices "continued to record mild annual increases."
In a statement, the spokesman predicted that inflation "should remain moderate in the short term," but admitted that "uncertainties arising from geopolitical tensions and commercial conflicts deserve attention."
Inflated future
In early February, the new US President Donald Trump announced an additional 10 percent rate on Hong Kong and mainland China imports.
Inflation in China also accelerated in January, for the first time since August, due to the strong increase in family spending, at the time of New Year's holidays, contrary to persistent deflationist pressures.
The Consumer Price Index (IPC) rose 0.5 percent in January, compared to the same period, the National Statistics Office (NBS) in the Asia reported on February 9. In December, inflation settled at 0.1 percent.
The temporary increase in consumption briefly checked the size of the deflait challenge that the world's second largest economy faces. The price of services increased by 0.9 percent, representing more than half of the total IPC increase, according to NBS.
The deflation in China factories extended for the 28th consecutive month, with a decline of 2.3 percent, remaining stable, compared to the contraction of the index in December. Domestic consumption is increasingly crucial and so the Chinese government has already advanced plans to increase public spending and reduce interest rates.
Beijing's fear is that a rooted price cycle of pricing can bark household expenses and push companies to salary and discharge cuts.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 01:21:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | Seoul will welcome North Korean soldiers who want to desert</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/20/ucrania-seul-acolhera-soldados-norte-coreanos-que-queiram-desertar/</link><description>South Korean authorities admitted yesterday to welcome the North Korean soldiers who are captured in Ukraine fight along with the Russian troops and want to desert from North Korea.
The South Korea Foreign Ministry has advanced in a statement that "North Korean soldiers are South Korean citizens according to the Constitution" so that "respecting the will of these people is to fulfill international law."
The South Korean government announcement was made following the latest reports that many North Korean soldiers were injured during the conflict after being sent to support Russia under the strategic defense agreement reached last year between the president Russian, Vladimir Putin, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
The Ukrainian authorities announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers who fought alongside the Russian troops in the Russian province of Kursk, where Kiev launched a military operation last summer.
The Ukrainian government proposed to return them to North Korea if Pyongyang agrees to facilitate an exchange with Ukrainian soldiers currently detained in Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky estimated that about 4,000 North Korean soldiers were killed or injured in Kursk, although the number was not verified.
The availability presented by the South Korean government arises after a soldier said in an interview with the Chosun Ilbo newspaper, which plans to ask for asylum in South Korea.

At the release event in Kuala Lumpur, the group reported that Huawei Mate XT consists of three screen, doubled twice and is the thinnest folding phone, with a 25.4mm screen, similar to an iPad da American Apple.
“At this time, Huawei is the only innovative in triple screen design models,” said Bryan Ma, analyst at the International Data Corporation Market Research Company.
Huawei has achieved this position although it does not have access to advanced semiconductors or Google services, by imposition of the US government. "All these things have been basically big obstacles to Huawei," Ma said, adding that the "resurgence we are seeing is a victory."
Huawei, China's first global technology brand, is at the center of a US Battle - China for the domain of commerce and technology. In 2019, Washington cut Huawei access to US components and technology, including Google and other mobile phones. It also prevented global suppliers from using US technology to produce components for the company.
US authorities have considered Huawei to pose a safety risk, which the company has denied. The Government of China has accused Washington of inappropriately using the concept of national security to contain a competitor on the rise of US technological companies.
Huawei announced Mate XT on September 20 last year, the same day Apple launched its iPhone 16 series in global markets. At the Kuala Lumpur event, Huawei also introduced its Matepad Pro tablet and Free Arc, its first open auriculars, and other portable devices.</description><pubDate>2025-02-20 02:23:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Real Estate | New houses prices remain falling</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/20/imobiliario-precos-das-casas-novas-continuam-em-queda/</link><description>The prices of new houses in China fell for the twentieth consecutive month in January, it was announced yesterday, despite the measures adopted by the government to stimulate the sector, which is dipped in a prolonged crisis.
Prices in the 70 main cities of the country fell 0.07 percent, compared to the previous month, according to calculations made from the figures released by the Chinese National Statistics Office (GNE). In December, the price of new houses registered a contraction of 0.08 percent.
The calculations made based on GNE data also reflect a 0.34 percent reduction in the price of secondhand houses in January, after decreasing 0.31 percent in the last month of 2024.
In recent months, Chinese authorities have announced measures to wrap the real estate market, an issue that worries Beijing, due to the implications for social stability, as housing is one of the main investment vehicles of Chinese families.
One of the main causes of the recent softening of the Chinese economy is precisely the crisis of the real estate sector, whose weight in national GDP - adding the indirect factors - was estimated at about 30 percent, according to some analysts.</description><pubDate>2025-02-20 02:14:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Vietname will build railway connection by the China border</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/20/vietname-vai-construir-ligacao-ferroviaria-junto-a-fronteira-com-a-china/</link><description>Vietnam approved yesterday the construction of a railway line connecting the Haiphong Port to Hanoi and the China border, with a cost of over eight billion dollars. The railway between the northern coast of Vietnam and the region bordering Yunnan's Chinese province aims to reinforce links between the two border countries and facilitate trade.
The new connection will serve Vietname's main factories, where Samsung, Foxconn, Pegatron and other world electronics giants are located, many of which depend on regular charges for components from China.
About 390 kilometers long, the connection will start from the port city of Haiphong to Lao Cai, in the Vietname North mountainous north, on the Yunnan border via Hanoi. It replaces the old line in operation, built over a century during the period of French Indochina.
China will finance part of the project through loans. During the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Hanoi, in December 2023, the two countries signed more than thirty agreements.
The new line will “boost economic, commercial, investment and tourist cooperation between the two countries,” said Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman Pham Thu Hang last week.
The new railway connection can help to mitigate the difficulties of international supply routes caused by the current dependence on slow and expensive trucks, which are “prone to strangulation on the border,” explained Dan Martin, a consulting firm expert Dezan Shira &amp; Associates.
"China provides a large part of Vietnam's industrial sector that feeds the industrial sector and it is essential to maintain this system stable," said the analyst, quoted by France-Presse. "A modern rail connection eliminates inefficiencies and ensures transport without problems of goods, whether sent to Vietnamese factories or world markets through Haiphong Port," he added.
Another line for China, which has not yet been approved by Parliament, will eventually connect Hanoi to the province of Lang Son, which borders the Chinese Guangxi region, through another vast area where foreign factories are found.
Vietname also provides for the construction of a high -speed railway line to connect Hanoi to the city of Ho Chi Minh, the economic capital of the southern, with an estimated cost of $ 67 billion, with the aim of reducing the travel time of 30 hours for about five hours.</description><pubDate>2025-02-20 02:13:32</pubDate></item><item><title>António Queirós, philosopher and academic: “the West there is great ignorance” about China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/antonio-queiros-filosofo-e-academico-a-ocidente-ha-uma-grande-ignorancia-sobre-a-china/</link><description>Doctorate in Philosophy of Sciences, Environmental and Environmental Ethics, António Queirós, linked to the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon, regrets that the West continues to face China in the wrong way, especially in environmental issues.

Will talk about the theme “The Environmental Crisis and the China Eco-Civilization Project”. What project is this?
This is China's great project for the New Age. It is a concept that began to be elaborated from 2013. This idea began to be realized with different projects. Since the “New Democracy” regime, which resulted from the Chinese resistance to the occupation of Japan and the geopolitical confrontation of the countries of the axis of different democracies. This is when the Popular Republic of China is proclaimed, such as the proclamation of the “new democracy” and comes awareness of the environmental crisis worldwide by China, with the regime to evolve into the so-called “ecological socialism” From 2003. It was necessary for the country to experience a model of industrialization common to the first experiences of socialism, and especially the capitalist countries. China's fundamental thesis is that all regimes can collaborate in building a new civilization, but this implies outdoor democratic reforms that are consigned in global civilization proposals, guaranteeing peace according to the principle of indivisibility of security. But I would like to point out the moment when the United Nations (UN), representing the whole world, became aware of the existence of an environmental crisis, from the Stockholm Conference, which took place in 1972. On the part of the organs of the socialist state, citizens and parties, it began in 2003. It is strange that issues like this never be debated to the West. The ideological confrontation that comes from the Cold War did not cease with Helsinquia's agreements, and therefore there are themes that are unknown to the West because of this harmful tradition of the Cold War, which has extended, and because the media have no openness. to discuss and present the proposals that China makes.
China is present and is an important actor in world meetings on environment and climate. Why do you understand that there is no discussion the West about the concept of eco-civilization?
It is not discussed why the West there is great ignorance about China and the reality of the country. The only advantage I have about most people who write and talk about China is that my relationship with the country is over 50 years old. I know how China was presented to the West 50 years ago. We lived [in Portugal], a fascist regime where information came to people with great difficulty. I have seen these years to all kinds of visions about China that lacked concrete information, because the country, until reform and openness, was a closed society. But this lack of information was general in the West. I also had visions that were not reality and I began to question myself if China's historical experience is unique, without parallel in the history of society, democracy and socialism, for its historical characteristics, hermeneutics, in the sense of method, analysis, analysis of concepts and starting points, which predominates the West, does not serve. But then let's go to the concrete issue, which is the responsibilities that China has in environmental matters.
Which, specifically, are…
One thing is the contribution that give China, India and other countries to global warming, because they are populations that represent most of humanity. There are technologies that are themselves polluting. But if we look at this angle we ended up falsifying reality, because greenhouse gases that exist in the atmosphere have been at least 150 years ago due to European and American industrialization. In terms of historical responsibility, the US is largely responsible [for global warming], and I cite official European Union data, for example. I speak of tons of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere in all these years.
Because they industrialized much earlier than China.
Yes, and presented an industry without this kind of environmental concerns. Therefore, this reality is hidden, which greenhouse gases have begun to pollute for 150 years and that it is not only today's contributions [which are the major causes of global warming].
Therefore, the idea that China is the main polluting country finds it wrong.
In current terms China and India can be the most polluting. But they are neither in “per capita” nor historically. What is really [in the Western discourse] is that they currently contribute [to global warming]. But then we have to see the trends where we are going to walk. But if we deepen this topic we have come to even less favorable conclusions to Western policies. China's environmental history can be summed up at four periods. The first period is in the years of reform and openness, from 1978, and the fourth period is when China launches the pilot projects of ecological civilization. The process is global. Still in relation to China's responsibilities, in the first phase the West and the industrialized east carried to China the most polluting industries, because China's appeal was to industrialize and create more employment. The UN resolution that adds an article beyond the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, finally recognizes as an inalienable right of the human being to a healthy environment. This statement, the West, completely truncated, reduced to no thing, has a preamble with 30 articles in which the environmental issue is not posed. Since this statement is no longer in line with current political and social reality, it has been moving, mutilated and reduced to formal freedoms. Also ignored by the set of citizens who do not know their origin either. China is co-founder of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a fact that is also concealed. But I also wanted to talk about the largest fallacy of the Western environmental policy.
What is it?
The idea that, from now on, one will protect nature. So what is done to what was destroyed? Especially in developing countries, because it was there that we sent these residues from the polluting industries and exploited all resources. No one wanted to know that, and what did China did? He assumed the leadership of the process and through his diplomacy to "act without acting," Tao's way, without violating nature, respecting the laws and dignity of things, approving the Kunming-Montreal agreement [on biodiversity]. We then have a commitment that the US probably will lie down to the rubbish crate to recover the biotypes that are destroyed, because much of the world is in environmental crisis and has so far been whistling to the side. China has a gradual view that risk factors in the environmental crisis tend to decrease with China's effort, both nationally and international. But the most remarkable issue in the idea of ​​building an ecological state in the country was the fact that, at the initiative of President XI Jinping, principles of environmental philosophy were included in the Statutes of the Chinese Communist Party, unprecedented in another Communist Party and even some ecologists.
Global reformulation
According to the study “Ecological Civilization in the People's Republic of China: Values, Action, and Future Needs”, by Arthur Hanson, published in 2019 by Asian Development Bank, the concept of ecological civilization “is being used by the Popular Republic of China ( RPC) to provide a coherent conceptual framework for adjustments to the development that responds to the challenges of the century XXI.
It differs from sustainable development in the emphasis placed in political and cultural factors, as well as in the definition of new relationships between people and nature that allow you to live well and within the eco-environmental boundaries of planet Earth. ”
In addition to reducing pollution and promoting circular economy, for example, they are also considered “domains of finance, law, institutional reinforcement and technological innovation”, having already been defined some ideas in five-year plans approved by Beijing, highlighting If “needs in the medium term, especially until 2035, when ecological civilization, in its basic form, is expected to be fully implemented for the modernization of the RPC”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 00:36:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Mark O'Neil launches biographical work on Liang Sicheng and contribution to Chinese architecture</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/20/mark-oneil-lanca-obra-biografica-sobre-liang-sicheng-e-contributo-para-a-arquitectura-chinesa/</link><description>Mark O'Neill, a journalist and author to reside in Hong Kong, published a biography of Liang Sicheng, responsible for documenting ancient Chinese architecture, which during the cultural revolution was the target of political persecution. The book written by the author of English origin, released by the publisher Joint, calls itself “Liang Sicheng: Guardian of the architectural history of China”
 
When did you contact Liang Sicheng's figure?
When I lived in Beijing I was interested in the old part of the city, for it was like no other in the world. Liang Sicheng said the following about this old part of Beijing: “The general layout shows the traditional system of the historic cities of China, being the result of geography, political and economic conditions of Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. It also expresses artistic management that led to a high level of success. It served the feudal era well and also serves life very well in the new age. It may be the capital of the New Age. This in no way prevents good development. All this creativity over a long time makes us proud. ” In the 1950s, Liang and a collaborator prepared a proposal of 25,000 characters for the construction of a new administrative center in the western part of the city, to house all the ministries and official buildings and leave the old city as it was. But the new government rejected this proposal and demolished most of the old city. Built its new capital in the center of the ancient city. This broke the heart of Liang and his wife Lin Huiyin. In Beijing, I met Liang's second wife, Lin Zhu. She explained all these dramatic events. It was a stimulus to write the book. Both she and her daughter, Liang Zaibing, wrote excellent books that describe all this. They were a fundamental research material for the book.
What do you consider most fascinating in Liang Sicheng's career?
I greatly admire Liang's aesthetic values ​​and his meticulous work in the documentation of China's old buildings, 2,738 in total. In 1944, in the midst of the worst horrors of the Japan war against China, which killed many of his friends and family, he wrote a letter to the US military representative in Chongqing. He made a list of historic places in Nara, Kyoto and Osaka, and proposed that they be spared to destroy the American bombers. What generosity and meaning of extraordinary humanity. In 2009, Nara raised a statue in her honor. He lived during the anti-Japanese war and the terrible campaigns of the beginning of the communist period. But it maintained its meaning of mission: preserving the treasures of Chinese architecture and forming a new generation of architects and the University of Tsinghua.
What are the main architectural currents, or specific buildings, which Liang helped preserve or draw attention?
He and his wife [Lin Huiyin] documented 2,738 old buildings with precious, Chinese and English measurements, and caught the national and international attention to them. Without it, many could have been destroyed or dropped into the degradation process. He defined the characteristics of traditional Chinese architecture and described the architects and artisans who built it.
It can be said that as intellectual, Liang Sicheng suffered persecution during the Cultural Revolution. In concrete terms, how was this period for Liang?
In chapter 10, we describe the Cultural Revolution as the Liang Calvary, as was for thousands of intellectuals and party officials [Chinese Communist Party]. Liang lived and worked at the University of Tsinghua campus. The government handed the campus control to frivolous red guards. Liang was an obvious target for them because he had studied in the United States, spoke English and had many foreign friends. The persecution he suffered was so severe that he eventually led him to death. In 1966, his health was already fragile; I was 65 years old. He was forced to write “self-confessions” and to attend mass critic sessions. The red guards looted their apartment. But he did not commit any crime, he was simply an architect and teacher. The criticism was absurd.
After the years of the Mao regime, two of his works were published. What do we tell us about the country's architecture?
After Mao's death and the end of the cultural revolution, he was rehabilitated and his works were published in Chinese and English. Its greatest legacy is the explanation of the history of Chinese architecture, the analysis of the old buildings and the techniques used to build them. One of the most famous is the Fo Guang Si Buddhist Temple, located in the Wutai mountains in Shanxi. Liang Sicheng caught the attention of the Chinese and foreign world to this legacy.
Liang Sicheng was one of the few architects of the time with foreign formation. What were the main influences revealed in the main architectural projects of the time?
Liang and his wife, as well as a small number of Chinese colleagues formed abroad, brought back to China the modern architecture. He taught her at the University of Northeast in Shenyang from 1928 to 1931, and at the University of Tsinghua, from 1945 to his death, and during the Cultural Revolution, these classes became impossible. This is another important legacy - the hundreds of architects who formed and the textbooks he wrote to them. In the global memory of ancient Chinese architecture, his work was fundamental. He launched the foundations for it. Since then, many have followed their example in the investigation, both Chinese and foreigners.
Liang Sicheng, an “extraordinary life” devotes to architecture
According to an official note about the work, released by the publisher Joint Publishing, Liang Sicheng had "an extraordinary life." Son of Liang Qi-Chao, one of China's most famous intellectuals, Liang Sicheng grew up in Japan. Educated at the University of Pennsylvania, Liang also studied at Harvard and was greatly influenced by American architects and architecture.
One of the few Chinese of his time with deep knowledge about modern architecture, Liang Sicheng returned to China in 1928 and spent more than 12 years to investigate the architecture of ancient China, continuing his work even during the years of World War II, when the years China was partially occupied by the Japanese.
He published his discoveries in Chinese and English newspapers, revealing to the world for the first time the history, knowledge and beauty of Chinese architecture. After World War II, he taught at Yale University and was the representative of China in the conception of the new United Nations (UN) headquarters in New York.
Post-1949 Life
After 1949, he remained in Beijing as head of the Architecture Department of the University of Tsinghua. He designed the main buildings of the new communist regime, but failed to persuade President Mao Zedong to preserve the ancient city of Beijing. In the 1950s, and in the years of the Cultural Revolution, it was severely criticized.
In January 1972 eventually died in the Chinese capital. With the end of the cultural revolution, his figure and reputation were rehabilitated and his own posthumously published. In 1984, his “pictorial history of Chinese architecture” was published in English by Wilma Fairbank, a friend of the architect and his wife, and married to the synologist John Fairbank.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Ricardo Clara Couto, author of the documentary about Francisco de Pina | The weight of the guilt that persists</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/ricardo-clara-couto-autor-do-documentario-sobre-francisco-de-pina-o-peso-da-culpa-que-persiste/</link><description>“Francisco de Pina - The Portuguese who wrote the future of Vietname” tells the story of Father Jesuit, born in Guarda in 1586, who made the romanization of the Vietnamese alphabet. The documentary, by Ricardo Clara Couto was funded by RTP2 and aired at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center
How did you come across this character in Portuguese history in the East?
My brother, named Filipe Pires, traveled for Vietnam for a while and when he arrived from the trip he told me that he had to know the incredible history of the Jesuit Francis of Pina who had made the romanization of the Vietnamese alphabet, providing freedom and cultural independence tremendous. I was a little skeptical at first, because I found it strange no one to know this in Portugal, but I started my research on the subject and discovered a university study of a Franco-Vietnamese teacher who teaches in Madeira. I then confirmed that the idea that my brother had brought from Vietname was correct. From there, I tried to discover the origin of this priest, the work he had done, and realize why there was so little knowledge about Francisco de Pina in Portugal.
In addition to being a Jesuit missionary, can you highlight some biographical points that help you understand your legacy?
In the documentary I did not have the time to be able to take a more exhaustive biographical approach. I focused on the part where he arrives at Vietname. We talk about a man with an incredible culture and a desire to acculturate and be acculturated. A man who was a musician and was easier, thus learning the Vietnamese, which is a six -tone language. Deep down, despite being a Jesuit priest, he had the first of course culture and not so much religion. This, for me, is a reason for huge admiration. For him the essential objective of evangelization was secondary, because, for him, if we could not understand the culture of Vietnam, we could not teach the Vietnamese people. It was more important to deepen local culture and language, making it possible to be able to explore the most religious part. It was also a man who had a hard time when he arrived at Vietname.
Why?
There were some internal wars before some local gentlemen of the regions who did not agree with the mission of the priests. This is not explored in the documentary, but in fact Francisco de Pina even made some steps [for the Jesuit mission], as the priests were not totally accepted everywhere. He eventually took refuge in a Japanese neighborhood and, from there, built his base.
Francisco de Pina, like what happened to many Jesuits at the time, was training in Macau, at the College of S. Paulo. How was it influenced by this period spent in the territory?
There is not much information about this time. It is known that it was indeed formed in this college, as was the case with many Jesuit priests at the time, but then went to Japan. Only then go to Vietname. So far, there was nothing of great relief in the life of Francisco de Pina, who followed the normal way. Japan was already expelling the Jesuit priests and it is in this context that goes to Vietname. The only most prominent thing about this period is that the 14 ships that left Portugal to arrive in Macau this year remained only three, and the ship where I was Pina Francisco was one of those who survived the storm.
Do you consider that your great legacy was the romanization of Vietnamese? What are the great contributions of this process in linguistic terms?
It is a giant contribution. If we think that even in the romanization of the language, Vietname was very dependent on the Chinese alphabet, and could not have cultural, linguistic and economic independence as well. After the romanization of the alphabet it was possible for Vietname to grow in these domains and have her own identity. The country has grown a lot to this day, because without writing a tongue passes only to the new generations of mouth in mouth, and the legacy of Francisco de Pina also remains today. The Vietnamese people are very grateful to this, and the proof is that two years ago a delegation of the Vietnammemesse Language Foundation Foundation came to Portugal and offered a monument to Guarda City Council (see Caixa) in honor of Francisco de Pina. However, I was surprised by the fact that the Vietnamese, and we talked about full -sided academics, know the story, the figure of Francisco de Pina, existing in the country several references. But in Portugal it is a little known figure.
How do you explain this?
I think this will have to do with the need Portugal has to make its catharsis about this period of history. Portugal was a completely different country from Africa to the East, and completely different from Africa to the Americas. But, however, there is this weight of guilt. Portugal cannot talk about this period of time, despite having a rich history between Africa and the East, but this time is not very approached because the country has not taken over what happened and, therefore, cannot talk about this period. Therefore, so much of the rich history of Portugal is unknown to the Portuguese.
How was the research process for the documentary?
I quickly arrived at the study of Professor Minh Ha Nguyen Lo Cicero of the University of Madeira, and with her we went to the roots of the Vietnamese language. When I discovered it was amazing, because it is part of the Vietnamese alphabet romanization triangle, as it is Franco-Vietnamese. Until recently, the official version that existed was that Alexandre de Rhodes, French Jesuit, had romanized the alphabet, later registering it in the Vatican and saying that it was a work in honor of his master, Francisco de Pina. However, the name of Francisco de Pina disappeared. From here we passed to the nationalist French official narrative that the romanization of the alphabet had been made by French because Vietname was a French colony. Then I also arrived at Professor António Morgado. The remaining contacts were made at Vietname, linguists, university professors and language specialists, especially in writing, who later joined the documentary.
How would you describe the Vietname of the time of Francisco de Pina?
It was very fragmented. They have a very their own culture that existed through a writing with Chinese hieroglyphics, but deals with Vietnamese, which led only 1 to 3 percent of the population to read and write. With the romanization this percentage increased exponentially, and with this the culture developed with the populations, united them more around common writing. I think this has made Vietname more modern and prepared to integrate into the rest of the world by having a more affordable language.
Do you feel it will help unravel this part of the history of Portugal, as well as the history of the Jesuit mission itself?
I hope so. Portugal seems to have a certain fear and shame to talk about this time, and proof of this is that this Vietnamese people came to Guard to offer a monument and practically did not come out of the subject. In addition, the representatives of the Vietname delegation were a little admired for not being received at an official level, except for the mayor of Guarda. I, who was invited by them to be present, felt a little shame of others, because Vietname came to Portugal to offer a monument and this is viewed as a secondary event, which is not. It would be important to make known this priest and this made to the country and the world, because Portugal and Vietnam have a very close and rich cultural history, as with Japan and China. But this is a little known aspect of the Portuguese people and [this documentary] can be a good opportunity for the country to make their catharsis.
Vietnamese artist sculpture resembles Francisco de Pina at Guarda
In November 2023, the Vietnamese Language Foundation offered the city of Guarda the sculpture “Nova Estela” by Vietnamese artist Nguyen Huy Anh. The work can be seen in the Garden of the Eduardo Lourenço Municipal Library. According to news from the agency Ecclesia, the event took place under the celebrations of the 824th anniversary of the attribution of Foral by King D. Sancho I to the city. “This is a posthumous tribute to Father Francisco de Pina, a Guarda-born Jesuit priest in 1586, whose religious path underwent a mission in Vietname, where he lived nine years of intense missionary activity, linguistics and of interculturality, ”said the Diocese of the Guard, in a statement.
According to the same note, the missionary Francisco de Pina was responsible for the introduction of the Latin alphabet and diacritical signs in the transcription of the sounds and tones of the Vietnamese language, which used, in writing, Chinese characters.
The priest embarked for over 400 years at the Nau de Nossa Senhora do Mount of Carmo, having completed the training at the São Paulo College in Macau and received the priestly ordination in Malaca. It was then called to the newly created Mission of the Jesuit Cchinchina, a zone that corresponds to the central part of the current Vietname. “He never came to the city where he was born and now returned in a bronze -carved boat by Vietnamese artists brought by the distant Vietname sea. From now on, Father Francisco de Pina will be in the historical memory of the guard and its inhabitants, materialized in this boat that brought him back to his city, leaving the name of the guard far, also written in Bronze letters ” , concluded the diocese.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 00:46:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Francisco Leandro, author and professor at the University of Macao: “Support from the country reinforces the role of Macao platform”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/16/francisco-leandro-autor-e-professor-na-universidade-de-macau-apoio-do-pais-reforca-o-papel-de-plataforma-de-macau/</link><description>Gang Wen interview with China Daily newspaper
Francisco Leandro, an associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Macao, states that the nation's support has allowed the MSA to serve as the Center for Commerce, Investment and Cultural Interactions between China and Portuguese Language Communities.
 
 
How do you see Macau's development since your return to the homeland? Among the city's achievements, which ones impressed him most? What about its sector, has there been an important progress in the last 25 years?
The 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the homeland and the creation of the Special Administrative Region of Macao is a significant milestone in the history of the region, reflecting a successful diplomatic process and demonstrating its current political and economic stability. Currently, RAE de Macao enjoys political stability and is deeply integrated into national development plans. The governance of the city under the beginning of “a country, two systems” allowed him to maintain a high degree of autonomy, while aligning himself with national policies. This integration facilitated Macao's economic growth, making it a vital part of the country's broader economic strategy.
Macao's socioeconomic development strategy is consecrated in the policy “a center, a platform, a base”. This picture aims to position MSA as a world center of tourism and leisure, reinforcing its attraction as a global tourist destination. In addition, MSAR acts as a platform for economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, promoting international trade and cultural exchange. Rae de Macao is also becoming a base of exchange and cultural cooperation, promoting cultural interactions and the conservation of heritage. This multifaceted approach supports Macao's integration into national development plans and reinforces its global presence. The unique position of MSA as a bridge between China, in particular the great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay, and Portuguese-speaking countries underline their strategic importance.
The concept of “a platform, three centers” enhances Macao's role in promoting economic and cultural exchange. This platform allowed the city to serve as a platform for trade, investment and cultural interactions, reinforcing the ties between China and the Lusophone world.
Macau's development as a tourism and leisure center, along with the promotion of four main industries - conventions and exhibitions, cultural and creative industries, traditional Chinese medicine and modern financial services - diversified its economy. These initiatives not only boosted economic activity, but also reinforced the global attraction of Macau as a tourist destination.
The central government adopted a series of policies for Macao. Is there any specific measure that has benefited your sector? As?
The interior of China and the Macao Economic Economic Partnership Agreement (Cepa) play a crucial role in the great bay and in the promotion of ties with Portuguese -speaking countries. By promoting commercial and economic cooperation, the strain reinforces the position of MSA as a bridge between China and Lusophone countries. This agreement facilitates access to the market, investment and cultural exchange, promoting Macao as an international business center. In addition, the strain supports the integration of Macau in the Great Bay area, contributing to regional development and economic diversification. This strategic role underlines the importance of Macau in the broader economic and diplomatic initiatives in the country.
The promotion of higher education in RAE de Macao also played a crucial role in its development. In investing in education and research, Macau contributed to the objectives of national development and was positioned as a center of academic excellence. This bet on education has allowed to create a skilled labor, essential to sustain economic growth and innovation. The University of Macao is highly considered in global academic rankings. It was classified in 180th place at the World University Rankings 2025 by Times Higher Education, and 245th at QS World University Rankings 2025. In addition, the University of Macao is ranked 262nd in the best global universities by US News &amp; World Report. These classifications reflect the university's commitment to excellence in teaching and research, particularly in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Engineering and Social Sciences. The university's strong international collaboration and innovative investigation contribute significantly to their estimated global position.
This year is the third anniversary of the creation of the Guangdong-Macau in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin. In your opinion, how should Macau continue to take advantage of the advantages of the zone to develop himself and the education sector?
Hengqin's cooperation zone is one of the main objectives of Macao's modernization efforts. This zone has been fundamental to boosting innovation and economic diversification, providing a space for new industries and promoting a narrower integration with the continent. The area exemplifies Macau's commitment to modernization and its strategic role in regional development.
Macao is a unique mix of Chinese and Portuguese cultures. In your opinion, how can this merger help the nation to reinforce communication with the international community and tell the good stories of China?
Macao is a fascinating mix of cultures, where the East meets the West in a unique and harmonious way. His linguistic landscape is a testimony of his multicultural heritage. The Chinese is the official language and the Portuguese language can be used for official purposes, reflecting the historical ties of Macao with Portugal and its Chinese roots. English is also widely spoken, especially in business and tourism, which makes Macau a truly multilingual society.
The legal system of MSAR is another domain in which this cultural mixture is evident. Based on the Portuguese Civil Law System, it was adapted to the local context under the “one country, two systems” principle. This double legal system allows a unique mix of Chinese and Western legal traditions, ensuring that Macau's legal environment is familiar to its residents and accessible to international companies.
Macao's approach to the extrajudicial resolution of commercial conflicts further enhances its multicultural policy. The city offers various arbitration and mediation services that serve both local and international parts, promoting the efficient and friendly resolution of disputes. Macao's open city policy and multicultural attitude are the key to its success as a global center. The city welcomes people from around the world, promoting a diverse and inclusive community. This opening is reflected in its festivals, its gastronomy and their daily lives, where different cultures coexist and enrich each other. Essentially, the mix of language, legal systems and multicultural attitudes of Macau makes it a unique and dynamic place that establishes bridges between cultures and promotes global bonds.
What achievements would you like to see by Macau in the next 25 years?
In short, Macao's future is brilliant, with greater integration with mainland China, its central role in international trade, diversified economic growth and a strong global presence. These elements will ensure Macao's continuous success and development at the world scene. The 25th anniversary of Macao's return to the Fatherland celebrates not only a successful diplomatic achievement, but also the continuous contributions of the region to national and world development. Macao's strategic initiatives and their integration in national plans underline their importance as a dynamic region and facing the future.</description><pubDate>2024-12-16 02:20:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion expropriated from any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies inquired live below the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death , systematically carried out to this day (still in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the county).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what cynically is called 'social exclusion', what term Orwellian, and there are under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>FHO RACING | Peter Hickman denies closing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/07/fho-racing-peter-hickman-nega-encerramento/</link><description>Peter Hickman, four times winner of the Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, denied the rumors that claimed that Macau Faye Ho businesswoman Fho Racing would have closed the doors and would be absent on the British Superbike Championship grid (BSB championship ) and the Macao Grand Prix in 2025
 
Peter Hickman goes to the fifth season in the British Championship with Fho Racing, however, before the season's start, some rumors came to circulate in Paddock about the team's future. In recent years, FHO Racing has become one of the top teams in the British Superbike Championship and road events, such as the MAN's island TT or the Macao Grand Prix.
Last November, the team announced that they featured Peter Hickman and Davey Todd, winner of the troubled last edition of the Macao Grand Motor Prize in the British Superbike Championship. Faye Ho said at the time that “for 2025 and also for this year's Macao Grand Prix, we have a very strong team, with Davey joining Pete and Michael aboard the BMW. We have two super talented drivers on the roads for next season, and with Davey jumping to the Superbike class, after winning the Superstock Championship for the second time, I think we'll have a strong season. I can't expect my team to return to Macau, I love to share my hometown with the team and show all points of interest, it's such a special place for me. ”
Although Hickman and Todd have been present at the BMW Motorrad Motorsport season in Berlin in mid -January, since November that Fho Racing has no news, which has generated some discomfort and doubts among fans. Hickman was testing his BMW M1000RR of his phr Performance in Spain, when he responded with a blunt "no" to a fan of a fan on Instagram social network about the rumor of the ceiling of activity of FHO Racing, a "no" that " It had wide repercussions in the specialized British press.
It's not the first time
After a difficult season of his team in 2024 in the British Superbike Championship, Faye Ho, Stanley Ho's granddaughter, had to face similar rumors last September. In Oulton Park, before the opening race of the 2024 showdown, Faye Ho confirmed to journalists that FHO Racing would continue to participate in the British Superbike Championship of 2025, “which is good news, but anything will be announced to your time. But I'm happy to be back here and to stay here, it's a big championship and I love to be in this racing environment. ”

On the eve of last Christmas, Sro Motorsport Group, the entity responsible for organizing numerous races and championships, including the GT World Challenge Asia and, as the official partner of the FIA, the co-coordination of the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau , announced the creation of a competition for GT4 vehicles, consisting of four events in China. At the time of the announcement, only the inaugural event in Shanghai and the end in Beijing had been confirmed as part of the calendar.
Almost 30 cars, representing an impressive total of ten automotive builders, participated in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race of 2024, a race that has become an important milestone over the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix in recent years. Indeed, no other GT4 event in Asia brings together such quantity and diversity of cars. The Balance of Performance (BOP), responsible for balancing the performance of the various participating cars, was, at the time, managed by SRO.
In a statement, Benjamin Frannasovici, managing director of Sro Motorsports Asia, said:
“We are enchanted, proud and privileged for adding the GT Cup - Great Bay Race to the inaugural calendar of Sro GT Cup, which begins and ends with the two largest motorized sports events in China. We already have a strong working relationship with the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, which has become the most significant race for GT4 cars in Asia. Its inclusion in the 2025 calendar of the SRO underlines the size of our ambition for this new national series. ”
High interest
The SRO GT Cup debut season starts in March at China's Formula 1 Grand Prix in Shanghai, before moving to the Zhuhai International Circuit - a place previously visited by SRO in BPR times and the FIA ​​GT Championship - where two 30 minutes races are planned. This is followed by Beijing's new city circuit, which will host the GT World Challenge Asia on the same weekend, before the big end of the Sro GT Cup season, scheduled for a month later at the Guide Circuit in Macao.
The enthusiasm surrounding this competition is evident. As Benjamin Franassovici said, “This is reflected in the number of consultations and registration for the full season we have received since the release of the championship, just before Christmas. The demand has exceeded our expectations. ”
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the season end event on the streets of Macau, with places to be assigned based on the classification after the second round of the championship, which is scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit. All pilots with “bronze” or “silver” classifications attributed by the FIA ​​are eligible to compete in this competition, as long as they use approved cars from the GT4 class.
To attract brands, the results of SRO GT Cup races will tell the SRO GT4 builders ranking, a title attributed to the brand with better performance in the GT4 category at the end of each season. SRO GT CUP joins its Asian equivalent, Japan Cup, in a list that also includes continental and national competitions in Europe, America and Australia.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 11:13:41</pubDate></item><item><title>GP TCR | Australia confirms presence in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/19/gp-tcr-australia-confirma-presenca-em-macau/</link><description>The 2025 season of TCR Australia will end largely when joining the TCR World Tour in the race of the 72nd Macao Grand Prix, which will take place from 13 to 16 November

The Macao driver has been in the active for the same time and will play the Macau Roadsport Challenge, the tourist car competition organized by the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), as well as the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix , in November
 
With the same enthusiasm recognized for decades, Rui Valente will again drive, in the 2025 season, a Subaru BRZ, the same car with which he competed in the Guide Circuit last November in the Macao Roadsport Challenge race. In the event held at the event of the territory, the Portuguese pilot finished sixth place, after losing some positions in the start, where he descended to tenth. The result was not even better because the rain -played race ended prematurely due to an opponent's accident.
