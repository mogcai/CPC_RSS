“A loss of incalculable dimensions for Portuguese literature, poetry, journalism, and feminism, to whom Maria Teresa Horta has proudly dedicated much of her life,” reads the editor to Lusa.
In the same text, Don Quixote regrets “the disappearance of one of the most notable and admirable personalities” of Portuguese literature, “recognized defender of women's rights and freedom, at a time when it was not always easy to assume it, author of a work that will be forever in the memory of several generations of readers. ”

“New Portuguese Letters”, written by Maria Isabel Barreno, Maria Teresa Horta and Maria Velho da Costa, from the love letters addressed to a French officer by Mariana Alcoforado, constituted a libel against the pre-pre-ideology in the pre-period April 25, which denounced the colonial war, the oppressions to which women were subject, a persecutory judicial system, emigration and fascist violence.

Until the end, the three refused to reveal and no one knows the authorship of each text individually, as Lusa Maria Teresa Horta, who contested a something widespread idea that most would be Maria Velho da Costa. “They were written by the three. No one will say [who wrote each text]. They are already dead and I neither killed nor live who wrote, because we made a vow, ”he said in 2022.

According to official information, in early January the average price of housing purchase and sale was 69,882 patacas per square meter, a reduction of 17 percent, compared to the price of the first half of January 2024. Average square meter reached 84,325 patacas.

The deputy suggests that the government requests social networks to remove publications to sell tickets
 
Deputy Chan Iek Lap advocates the need to implement security systems against fraud on selling concert tickets. The subject was approached through a written interpellation, in which the member of the Legislative Assembly is concerned about increasing the mockeys and sales of tickets in the black market.
According to the data presented by the deputy, only in the latest times, police authorities received complaints from various residents and citizens of the interior of China who were deceived when they tried to buy tickets for concerts in the territory. The values ​​of the latest slips exceeded 110,000 patacas.
In Macao, in the image of what happens in Hong Kong, tickets made available for sale to the public are reduced and rapidly run out, as they are reserved in advance, or due to the use of software by black market sellers that flood the sites from sale.
As a result, stakeholders end up buying tickets on the black market, where they pay higher prices or gaps, which happens when they pay for tickets they never receive.
“This situation has become a widespread concern of the population, especially the problem of the increasing black market,” writes Chan Iek Lap. “Given the increasing number of frauds in ticket sales, the government intends to review the ticket management system and reinforce the legal system of buying and selling concert tickets, in order to avoid the occurrence of similar fraud ? ”Asks the deputy.
Currently, according to the deputy, the illegal sale of tickets can be punished with a prison penalty up to three years or a fine of not less than 120 days.
Line for complaints
As part of the effort to combat the black market, the deputy also wants to know if the police will create contact points exclusively to receive complaints about the black market.
On the other hand, Chan Iek Lap asks if there is a possibility that the government intercede with companies owners of social networks to prevent the sale in the black market. “The government is intended to reinforce cooperation with social networking platforms and demand them to examine ticket information and delete illegal messages?” He asks.
The deputy also asks if the government is planning measures to avoid the use of the black market, where consumers are fragile, and organize awareness campaigns to alert the public.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 00:57:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Checks | Ron Lam asks for cuts for those who do not live in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/cheques-ron-lam-pede-cortes-para-quem-nao-vive-em-macau/</link><description>The nature, objectives and limits to the distribution of pecuniary checks returned to the agenda. Two weeks after Lo Choi in suggested the end of the attribution of the checks to those who are out of Macau, Ron Lam shares the same opinion and asks if the measure is a support or dividend department
 
Less than a month and a half after Sam Hou Fai's inauguration as the Chief Executive, the question of cutting in the distribution of pecuniary checks returned to the agenda. Ron Lam understands that the government should explain the original intent and definition of the reimbursement program, clarifying whether the measure is financial support or dividend distribution. Ron Lam's statements asking for conceptual clarifications, published yesterday in the newspaper or Mun, were provided with possible “later adjustments” to the measure.
The deputy argues that, as supported by the beneficiaries of the non -compulsory central social security regime, the distribution of pecuniary checks must be limited to those who remain in the territory at least 183 days in a year.
It is recalled that the “pecuniary reimbursement plan in economic development” has been presented by the government as a way to “share with the population the fruits of economic development”.
Regardless of the objective referred to every year by successive executive, since 2008, Ron Lam states that public policies need to have concrete objectives and directions to ensure efficient execution and adjustments with scientific accuracy. These are the priorities pointed out by the deputy, before deciding changes to the amount attributed and if the distribution is cut to residents living outside Macao. However, it underlines that the cancellation of the program is not realistic.
The age of why
If the pecuniary check concerns the sharing of the fruits of economic development, which explains its distribution during the pandemic when the territory plunged into an economic crisis and budget deficit? The deputy points out that during the three years of pandemic, the government did not make the usual capital injections in the individual accounts of the non -compulsory central social security regime. Despite saying that he did not agree with the suspension of capital injections, Ron Lam indicated that the government must clearly clarify the nature of its policies.
Ron Lam recalled that about 100,000 residents who do not live in Macao benefit from the pecuniary check.
According to data from the budgetary proposals for the economic year of 2025, cited by the deputy, the public was saved 79.32 million patacas with checks that were not deposited within three years. Ron Lam pointed out that the government should verify if recipients who have not changed the check are still alive.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 00:49:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Ricardo Clara Couto, author of the documentary about Francisco de Pina | The weight of the guilt that persists</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/ricardo-clara-couto-autor-do-documentario-sobre-francisco-de-pina-o-peso-da-culpa-que-persiste/</link><description>“Francisco de Pina - The Portuguese who wrote the future of Vietname” tells the story of Father Jesuit, born in Guarda in 1586, who made the romanization of the Vietnamese alphabet. The documentary, by Ricardo Clara Couto was funded by RTP2 and aired at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center
How did you come across this character in Portuguese history in the East?
My brother, named Filipe Pires, traveled for Vietnam for a while and when he arrived from the trip he told me that he had to know the incredible history of the Jesuit Francis of Pina who had made the romanization of the Vietnamese alphabet, providing freedom and cultural independence tremendous. I was a little skeptical at first, because I found it strange no one to know this in Portugal, but I started my research on the subject and discovered a university study of a Franco-Vietnamese teacher who teaches in Madeira. I then confirmed that the idea that my brother had brought from Vietname was correct. From there, I tried to discover the origin of this priest, the work he had done, and realize why there was so little knowledge about Francisco de Pina in Portugal.
In addition to being a Jesuit missionary, can you highlight some biographical points that help you understand your legacy?
In the documentary I did not have the time to be able to take a more exhaustive biographical approach. I focused on the part where he arrives at Vietname. We talk about a man with an incredible culture and a desire to acculturate and be acculturated. A man who was a musician and was easier, thus learning the Vietnamese, which is a six -tone language. Deep down, despite being a Jesuit priest, he had the first of course culture and not so much religion. This, for me, is a reason for huge admiration. For him the essential objective of evangelization was secondary, because, for him, if we could not understand the culture of Vietname, we could not teach the Vietnamese people. It was more important to deepen local culture and language, making it possible to be able to explore the most religious part. It was also a man who had a hard time when he arrived at Vietname.
Why?
There were some internal wars before some local gentlemen of the regions who did not agree with the mission of the priests. This is not explored in the documentary, but in fact Francisco de Pina even made some steps [for the Jesuit mission], as the priests were not totally accepted everywhere. He eventually took refuge in a Japanese neighborhood and, from there, built his base.
Francisco de Pina, like what happened to many Jesuits at the time, was training in Macau, at the College of S. Paulo. How was it influenced by this period spent in the territory?
There is not much information about this time. It is known that it was indeed formed in this college, as was the case with many Jesuit priests at the time, but then went to Japan. Only then go to Vietname. So far, there was nothing of great relief in the life of Francisco de Pina, who followed the normal way. Japan was already expelling the Jesuit priests and it is in this context that goes to Vietname. The only most prominent thing about this period is that the 14 ships that left Portugal to arrive in Macau this year remained only three, and the ship where I was Pina Francisco was one of those who survived the storm.
Do you consider that your great legacy was the romanization of Vietnamese? What are the great contributions of this process in linguistic terms?
It is a giant contribution. If we think that even in the romanization of the language, Vietname was very dependent on the Chinese alphabet, and could not have cultural, linguistic and economic independence as well. After the romanization of the alphabet it was possible for Vietname to grow in these domains and have her own identity. The country has grown a lot to this day, because without writing a tongue passes only to the new generations of mouth in mouth, and the legacy of Francisco de Pina also remains today. The Vietnamese people are very grateful to this, and the proof is that two years ago a delegation of the Vietnammemesse Language Foundation Foundation came to Portugal and offered a monument to Guarda City Council (see Caixa) in honor of Francisco de Pina. However, I was surprised by the fact that the Vietnamese, and we talked about full -sided academics, know the story, the figure of Francisco de Pina, existing in the country several references. But in Portugal it is a little known figure.
How do you explain this?
I think this will have to do with the need Portugal has to make its catharsis about this period of history. Portugal was a completely different country from Africa to the East, and completely different from Africa to the Americas. But, however, there is this weight of guilt. Portugal cannot talk about this period of time, despite having a rich history between Africa and the East, but this time is not very approached because the country has not taken over what happened and, therefore, cannot talk about this period. Therefore, so much of the rich history of Portugal is unknown to the Portuguese.
How was the research process for the documentary?
I quickly arrived at the study of Professor Minh Ha Nguyen Lo Cicero of the University of Madeira, and with her we went to the roots of the Vietnamese language. When I discovered it was amazing, because it is part of the Vietnamese alphabet romanization triangle, as it is Franco-Vietnamese. Until recently, the official version that existed was that Alexandre de Rhodes, French Jesuit, had romanized the alphabet, later registering it in the Vatican and saying that it was a work in honor of his master, Francisco de Pina. However, the name of Francisco de Pina disappeared. From here we passed to the nationalist French official narrative that the romanization of the alphabet had been made by French because Vietname was a French colony. Then I also arrived at Professor António Morgado. The remaining contacts were made at Vietname, linguists, university professors and language specialists, especially in writing, who later joined the documentary.
How would you describe the Vietname of the time of Francisco de Pina?
It was very fragmented. They have a very their own culture that existed through a writing with Chinese hieroglyphics, but deals with Vietnamese, which led only 1 to 3 percent of the population to read and write. With the romanization this percentage increased exponentially, and with this the culture developed with the populations, united them more around common writing. I think this has made Vietname more modern and prepared to integrate into the rest of the world by having a more affordable language.
Do you feel it will help unravel this part of the history of Portugal, as well as the history of the Jesuit mission itself?
I hope so. Portugal seems to have a certain fear and shame to talk about this time, and proof of this is that this Vietnamese people came to Guard to offer a monument and practically did not come out of the subject. In addition, the representatives of the Vietname delegation were a little admired for not being received at an official level, except for the mayor of Guarda. I, who was invited by them to be present, felt a little shame of others, because Vietname came to Portugal to offer a monument and this is viewed as a secondary event, which is not. It would be important to make known this priest and this made to the country and the world, because Portugal and Vietnam have a very close and rich cultural history, as with Japan and China. But this is a little known aspect of the Portuguese people and [this documentary] can be a good opportunity for the country to make their catharsis.
Vietnamese artist sculpture resembles Francisco de Pina at Guarda
In November 2023, the Vietnamese Language Foundation offered the city of Guarda the sculpture “Nova Estela” by Vietnamese artist Nguyen Huy Anh. The work can be seen in the Garden of the Eduardo Lourenço Municipal Library. According to news from the agency Ecclesia, the event took place under the celebrations of the 824th anniversary of the attribution of Foral by King D. Sancho I to the city. “This is a posthumous tribute to Father Francisco de Pina, a Guarda-born Jesuit priest in 1586, whose religious path underwent a mission in Vietname, where he lived nine years of intense missionary activity, linguistics and of interculturality, ”said the Diocese of the Guard, in a statement.
According to the same note, missionary Francisco de Pina was responsible for the introduction of the Latin alphabet and diacritical signs in the transcription of the sounds and tones of the Vietnamese language, which used in writing Chinese characters.
The priest embarked for over 400 years at the Nau de Nossa Senhora do Mount of Carmo, having completed the training at the São Paulo College in Macau and received the priestly ordination in Malaca. It was then called to the newly created Mission of the Jesuit Cchinchina, a zone that corresponds to the central part of the current Vietname. “He never came to the city where he was born and now returned in a bronze -carved boat by Vietnamese artists brought by the distant Vietname sea. From now on, Father Francisco de Pina will be in the historical memory of the guard and its inhabitants, materialized in this boat that brought him back to his city, leaving the name of the guard far, also written in Bronze letters ” , concluded the diocese.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 00:46:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Seoul | Openai and Kakao Messaging Service announce a new partnership</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/seul-openai-e-servico-de-mensagens-kakao-anunciam-nova-parceria/</link><description>The American technology company OpenAi and the leading messaging service in South Korea, Kakao, announced yesterday a new collaboration project to incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) on this South Korean platform.

“New Portuguese Letters”, written by Maria Isabel Barreno, Maria Teresa Horta and Maria Velho da Costa, from the love letters addressed to a French officer by Mariana Alcoforado, constituted a libel against the pre-pre-ideology in the pre-period April 25, which denounced the colonial war, the oppressions to which women were subject, a persecutory judicial system, emigration and fascist violence.
It began to be written in May 1971 and was published in April 1972, having been banned by the dictatorship and its authors taken to trial.
Until the end, the three refused to reveal and no one knows the authorship of each text individually, as Lusa Maria Teresa Horta, who contested a something widespread idea that most would be Maria Velho da Costa. “They were written by the three. No one will say [who wrote each text]. They are already dead and I neither killed nor live who wrote, because we made a vow, ”he said in 2022.
Active life
Born in Lisbon in 1937, Maria Teresa Horta attended the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon, was leader of ABC Cine-Clube, activated militant in the movements of female emancipation, journalist of the newspaper A Capital and leader of Women magazine.
As a writer, she made her debut in the field of poetry in 1960, but built a literary course also composed of novels and short stories. With books edited in Brazil, in France and Italy, Maria Teresa Horta was the first woman to perform driving functions in Cineclubism in Portugal and is considered one of the exponents of Lusophony feminism.
It has been widely awarded throughout its literary career, highlighting, in recent years, the Authors 2017 Award, in the Best Poetry Book category, for “Annunciations”, the Cultural Merit Medal with which the Ministry of Culture distinguished it in 2020, the Póvoa Casino Literary Prize, which won in 2021 for the work “Strangeness”, and the decoration in 2022, with the degree of great officer of the Order of Liberty by the President of the Republic.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 01:33:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Music | Gisela João edits album “Naked” in defense of Liberdade</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/musica-gisela-joao-edita-album-inquieta-em-defesa-da-liberdade/</link><description>Portuguese fadista Gisela João is back on albums with “restless”, a work that celebrates freedom and is a tribute to April 25. The discographic work, with many songs by Zeca Afonso, goes out to stores this Friday
 
Gisela João's new album, “Trees”, coming out on Friday, honors April, is for freedom and on the impact of freedom on daily life.
“I want to make it very clear that my intention with this album is greater than the date itself, it is greater than all this, it is to remember the people that our freedom,” the freedom of each of us, imposes “taking care of Freedom ”that“ is ours and our neighbor ”, that freedom“ has an impact directly on other people's life and freedom, ”the fadista said in an interview with Lusa agency.
The album reflects the series of shows that the singer performed for the country last year, at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of April 25. To Lusa, the fadista said she felt “need to record these songs, to sing freedom”, the uppermate freedom.
About the album alignment, mostly, consisting of songs from José Afonso's repertoire, Gisela João stated that “he was made to look at the world”, what is happening around him and, “feeling almost as a spirit of mission , to sing the freedom of defending it, to give these words again to the public, ”because" they are very necessary letters and we need to hear them. "
Gisela João recorded José Afonso's repertoire with new musical arrangements, songs such as “See Bem”, “Death came out on the street”, “What Love doesn't deceive me”, but also by Paulo de Carvalho, “and after the goodbye” - Song Which was one of the passwords for the Strike of April 25, 1974 -, by Sérgio Godinho, “What a strength is this friend”, by Fernando Lopes -Graça, “Wake up!”, which the composer debuted with the choir of the amateur gym academy of music, and José Mário Branco, “restlessness”.
Always fight
The singer defended the need for "a constant struggle" and "a very concrete defense of freedom that is a right by birth." "The right of anyone who is born to freedom, the freedom to be what one wants to be, and to be the one who is desired and who dreams," he argued.
Gisela João highlighted the current repertoire she recorded and her creators, which marked Portuguese music in recent decades. "These authors - José Afonso, Sérgio Godinho, Fausto - could have written these songs today," he said.
"If we hear the news and go out to the street and look with eyes to see what goes on, it is very easy to fit phrases from these authors or the whole songs and sing them, because they fit the time we live."
Gisela João warned of the need for a vigilance, for “freedom is not an acquired data” “freedom - to be all free - allows him to hear and see things that should not happen. And who defends this freedom? We must be us every day to defend our freedom and that of others, ”he said. "A complex situation," he said, "but a necessary and constant debate."
Zeca, the Genius
Recognizing the importance of José Afonso's civic and political intervention, author of most of the songs of "restless", Gisela João stressed the "genius" of her musical creativity, which referred to as "impressive".
“The quality of the melodies he has done, [all] has something that is the hardest to do; Doing things that seem so simple and are of immense depth. That's why I can guarantee that I don't know anyone who these melodies do not touch, do not talk to people. ”
"They are very simple melodies, but they are not really, they are very dense, and they touch people, that is what makes people feel something on the skin," he added, noting that "there is a very Portuguese signature in these songs."
“There are [in those songs] - neither, I can explain how - anything that makes me feel very Portuguese, as in fado,” said Gisela João, who confided that when he hears them, it seems that he is making a mantra with himself: “One one Cantilena in repetition that is calming my soul. ”
Asked about the responsibility she feels when interpreting these songs, the fadista said that when she begins to sing is as if she was not there. “What is there is the poem; And I wish I could take people to where I go when I'm singing. ”
“The truth is that the poems are much bigger than me, and together with the perfect melodies for them, for the words to sound like they need to sound. They are much bigger than me. I feel like I get in the background. I just feel like a vehicle to give to words what they need, and to make them reach people, ”he told Lusa.
The interpreter highlighted the musical arrangements, “most airy”. And among the ten songs that constitute the alignment, he referred to his difficulty in finding the way he sing “and after the goodbye” (José Niza/José Calvário), to distance himself from the interpretation of his creator, Paulo de Carvalho.
Gisela João argued that “each one is unique” and that when he sings, he has to “know how to speak”. What sings, make yours. "I have to feel that," he emphasized.
For the interpreter, “and after the goodbye”, in the interpretation of Paulo de Carvalho, “it's perfect, it's round, that's it,” which made her “very restless”, because “she didn't want to sing like him or to do to Paulo de Carvalho ”.
“Suddenly, to read the poem so much and, related to the phase of life in which I find myself, I needed to sing it to me, deconstructing the poem and not talking about one love relationship with each other; Looking in a different way and talking about the love relationship I have with myself, where I am, where I want to go, who I am, how many of me I left along the way, which of me I want to rescue, ”he said .
"Sorry for the boldness and immodesty, but this song, I recorded it to me, and I will be very happy to know if someone, when hearing it, wants to make a point of situation of himself." “The Brave”, “Fall Ballad” and “Pack of Pack of Packet” are also part of the alignment of “restless”, with arrangements by Luís' Twins' Pereira, Gisela João, Carles Reds Martinez, and executive production and recording of Luís' Twins' Pereira.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 01:28:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Nissan Motor | Court confirms a conviction of former director</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/nissan-motor-tribunal-confirma-condenacao-de-ex-director/</link><description>American Greg Kelly, former director of Nissan Motor, was yesterday again convicted in Japan for collaborating on the financial irregularities committed by former President Carlos Ghosn, run away from Japanese justice.
The Supreme Court of Tokyo upheld the decision made in March 2022 by another court in the capital, which was the subject of appeal by the defendant, after receiving a suspended sentence of six months in prison.
Kelly, once Ghosn's right arm, was considered guilty of conspiring with the former president of the company not to declare future compensation agreed between Nissan and the maximum leader of the automobile manufacturer.
The suspended imprisonment meant that Kelly had not to serve a prison sentence as long as she was not involved in any criminal activity over three years, and in practice allowed her to return to the United States.
Kelly alleged in the appeal the acquittal of all accusations that he was considered guilty. The prosecution requested up to two years in prison for the US executive, detained in Japan in November 2018, at the same time as Ghosn's detention.
The American jurist worked at Nissan as a representative director, one of the highest positions at the top of the company, and turned out to be the only Nissan executive to be tried after other Japanese officials have reached court agreements.
The sentence of 2022, confirmed yesterday, was the first in the 2018 process against Ghosn, which shook the automotive industry, because it is one of the most respected executives among the largest car manufacturers in the world.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 01:35:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Airport | Security Control Zone will be extended</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/03/aeroporto-zona-de-controlo-de-seguranca-sera-alargada/</link><description>The Macao International Airport Security Control Area will be expanded and the works must be completed in the third quarter of this year, according to information revealed by the airport department representative, Chan Chan Keong.

From him he received a baton that surprisingly allowed him to travel, as flying, incredible distances.
Fei tried to learn from the master his secrets, but failed to the third test. When Hugong sent him home, he told him to lie down on a nearby lake called Gebei. As he throw him, Fei Zhangfang noticed how he became a blue dragon. The legend that, in his multiple senses, alluded to the ability of the spirit of the Spirit making astonishing changes and unprecedented displacements in space, would be a recurring theme in figurative paintings at the end of the Ming Dynasty.
An Xuzhou painter (Jiangsu) called Wan Shouqi (1603-1652), who lived in the Ming-Qing Dynastic Transition, will have added yet another meaning to the figuration in 1650, a representation of amazed Fei on the sidelines of Lake witnessing The emergency of the Blue Dragon, on a fan (paint and color on paper, 20.9 x 46.6 cm, at the Minneapolis Art Institute).
The fan, Zhongli's prop, one of the Ba Xian (the eight immortals), who when he shaken him had, among others according to his will, the power to resurrect dead. Wan Shouqi's willingness to return to the old dynasty in one of the "brush names", Hao, which he chose: Mingzhi daoren, who can have several readings, such as "Daoist with a brilliant ideal »Or" the daoist who recalls the ming. " From his biography he emphasizes the fact that in 1628, when he had not yet obtained the Jini degree, he participated in a large feast offered by Emperor Chongzhen (R.1627-1644) to the most illustrious literate in the Empire.
Wan Shouqi joined in 1632 to the literary and politics 'Society of Renewal', Fushe, which opposed the power of the palace's eunuchs and proposed to eliminate the sterile literary styles of imperial examinations, reviving the lessons of ancients with more useful themes.
In the period of disorder that followed the fall of the Ming, Wan wandered in the territory until she settled on a farm near her hometown. Then, in 1651, in a painting roll in which it is clear his knowledge of the great masters (ink on paper, 20 x 289 cm, at the Guimet museum), painted his residence in response to a friend's request, as if he was a invitation. He wrote: «Here's my Caotang pee. Master Jin made me promise that he would dedicate a poem, but the poem does not appear; So I painted this roll to my own pleasure. The ancients said, "In all paintings there is a poem."

January 29, 2025
To know more deeply the nature of wooden serpent Yin (乙巳蛇 yǐ sì shé), it will be convenient to analyze the stories related to this reptile of the sixth terrestrial field in close association with the female principle.
It comes closely associated with the matriarchal divinity nϋwa (女娲 nǚwā) in the following myths “nϋwa creates humans” (女娲造人 nǚwā zào fench) and “nϋwa to the sky” (女娲补天 nǚwā bǔ tiān). In myths divinity arises alone, complete in itself, as a creative force, in the first myth, and as a regenerating and constructive force in the second, when mending the sky.
As a mother of humanity, he did not remember being the following one of a visit to Earth, having first created the animals, but as he still felt deep loneliness, he decided to generate human beings: he could do so for containing powerful energy Soul, manifested in his quality of being heavenly, whose physical appearance was distinguished, because although he had a human head, he had a serpent body. It spontaneously generated with the help of the clay, that is, the Earth, an element to which it is indissolibly linked, either in the underground world, in wells, or in its agile climbing by the mountains and trees in an instinctive search for heavenly ascension.
It is still this same figure with a serpent body that will replace order on Earth, when it plunges into chaos, following dignifying titanic forces, as in some versions it is affirmed that he has not wounded the sky after the god of northern Água do Norte, gonggong Founded his head against Buzhoushan (共工怒触不周山 Gònggōng Nù Chù Bùzhōushān), in an attack of fury against Northern Heavenly Emperor, Zhuanxu (颛顼 Zhuānxū), following the defeat inflicted by this.
The way it has not taken the sky, the care it has put in raising its pillars, establishing them with the aid of stones, whose colors (green, yellow, white, dark and red) indicate the presence of the five elements, essential to Life, as well as the foundation of them erected on the paws of a black turtle, in order to ensure their longevity but even eternity; The precious aid he granted to humanity in the fight against beasts that in the bastard of collapse pulled, the works of drainage he then made, transformed this deity with the body of serpent into one of the foundations of Chinese religious culture and civilization.
Note is the powerful ambivalence of this reptile, since it was not booming the body of serpent, Gonggong, the Folunum God of Water, is described with the same body of serpent, otherwise see how portrayed in “Gonggong throws the head against Buzhoushan: “Gonggong was a descendant of Yandi. It had a body of serpent, face and human limbs, as well as red hair, which indicated its fiery, energetic and adamant character ”(WANG, ALVES, 2009: 54).
Serpents have poison, which heals as much as it kills, and can become, by their immense mutation capacity, into excellent humans as in the case of Banga Serpent (白娘子 Bai Niángzi), even in small dragons (小龙 xiǎolóng), when developing The generous and meditative facet, when connecting and advocating superior values, such as love, in the famous legend that came to us, for example, through Zhao Qingge (赵清阁) in 《白蛇传》 (Bai shé zhuàn).
However, by their strength, capacity and intelligence can conflict as in the history of popular literature “discussion between serpent and the sun”, which might be able to find cultural equivalent in the Aesop's fable competition “wind and the sun”.  In “The Serpent argues with the sun” (蛇与太阳的争吵) There is an obvious rivalry between the sun, representative of the yang male element, beautiful, bright, hot and powerful and the equally portentous serpent, considers themselves as much power from the earth.
It challenges the sun, beginning a conflict between the power of the lunar mysterious and hidden forces, represented by the serpent, and the splendid irradiative brightness of solar energy. Finally the fable ends not with the victory of the sun, in the manner of Aesop, but with the need for recognition of complementarity, because without the alternation of night and day, sun and shadow, heat and cold the world, As the Chinese understand it (based on this tension harmony) would not be complete. Moral of History: If there was no sun, it would be the death of the earth, for it would plunge into an infinite night, if there were no snakes, it would be equally the end of the world, because there would be no agility, no ability to transform, plunging “everything that exists under heaven ”(天下 tiānxià) in immense rigidity and monotony.
The serpent, as a sixth terrestrial field of the Chinese zodiac (十二生肖蛇 shí´èr shēngxiào) also symbolizes the ingenious animal, which, due to its powerful intelligence, is able to architect and carry out a well -calculated plan. This is proved by his biography upon entering the heavenly race promoted by the Emperor of Jade (玉皇大帝 Yù Hung dàdì).
The serpent and the dragon used to be good companions and share the same aquatic spaces, when he learned of the emperor's intention to organize a competition so that twelve animals could command the stars and destinations of humans. Given the powerful intelligence of the reptile, he realized that he had no hypothesis or quickness to overcome the dragon, but as he knew how to make good calculations and better plans, he shared discreetly to the horse's back, without the one he was carrying a rival nearby From the goal it jumped to position herself in front of the equity, and so it was, both good friends to our day, since the always generous horse never charged her the ride.  For the Chinese, the serpent symbolizes “a powerful and victorious mill” (以巧胜力 yǐ qiǎo shènglì).
Another story draws attention to the importance of forgiveness in the ascetic process of the serpent towards transformation into a small dragon: “the serpent and the farmer” (蛇与农夫 shé yǔ knomfū). In a harsh winter, a certain farmer went with a stuffed snake. Studying her, he took him home, putting her in a warm place. When he recovered his strength instead of thanking him for being saved, he attacked the poor unprepared man with the aim of injuring him. This, avoiding in time being bitten and repressing the fury, called the reptile to reason with calmly, asking him if that was how he treated a friend who had saved his life. The serpent, played by the proven goodness of the farmer, never attacked him again. Moral of the story that the Chinese tell their children: goodness pays off and can save not only bodies as souls.
The serpent symbolizes the divinity “guardian of the treasures of the earth” in 蛇守护宝藏 (shé shŏuhù bǎozàng), finding himself at the entrance of caves to watch over the infinite riches. The guardians are gigantic, endowed with a prodigious force, but also with deep and mysterious wisdom.  Anyone who tries to penetrate these caves will not achieve it as much as they have. Only someone very special, of heroic spirit and armed with virtuous wisdom will pass the proof, providing access to the treasures of the earth, not for its own enjoyment, but for the benefit of the community and/or humanity.
I end with my translation of another popular story, entitled “White Serpent, Black Serpent” (白蛇与黑蛇 Bái shi yǔi shé), which presents and summarizes and the need for both principles, Yin and Yang, always operate In equilibrium, being the black serpent, representative yin of mysterious and lunar force and the white, symbolizing the radiant force Yang energy, its counterpoint.
很久以前 ， 在一座隐秘的山中 ， 有两条神蛇 有两条神蛇 有两条神蛇 白蛇与黑蛇。白蛇象征纯洁与善良 生活在阳光明媚的山顶 生活在阳光明媚的山顶 守护着清澈的溪流与花草；黑蛇则代表力量与神秘 ， ，栖息在幽暗的山谷 ， 掌控着风暴与黑夜。
一天 ， 一场大旱袭击了山谷 ， 水源枯竭。白蛇认为 ， 只有靠善行和祈愿才能带来水 ， 而黑蛇则主张用力量召唤风暴来解决问题。两蛇因此争执不休 ， 各自施展法力 ， ，山中风暴与烈阳交替 ， 导致自然失衡 ， 生灵涂炭。在看到生灵的痛苦后 ， 白蛇与黑蛇意识到 ， 单靠善良或力量都无法真正拯救山林。它们最终联手 ， 白蛇用其善念唤来生命的春雨 ， 黑蛇用其力量引导水流重回山谷 ， 山林恢复生机 ， 两蛇也化作山中的守护灵。 (https://www.lingoace.com/zh/blog/story-for-the- Year-of-Snake/)
Once a large drought on the valley was slaughtered, exhausting all the sources and water reserves that existed there. The white serpent believed the power of its good deed and prayers to return, while the black serpent argued that only by invoking the strength of storms would the question be resolved.  The two snakes argued nonstop, each displaying and exercising their abilities, sometimes with violent storms, sometimes with they are scorching. This situation led to the loss of balance in nature and the miserable suffering of living beings. When they both saw what they were suffering, they realized that if they just depended on the Benfazeja from the sun or that of the crashes, they would not have to save that mountainous region. Finally, they combined efforts. The white serpent invoked the vital energy of spring rain and the black serpent employed its strength to let the waters flow through the valleys and mountains to recover life. And this is how the two snakes became the Guardian Spirits of the Mountain.

The lunar year begins on January 29 and will end on February 16, 2026 and for Feng Shui starts at 10:10 pm on February 3, when the Principle of Spring (Lichun) is celebrated. Unlike the previous year, without any Lichun, they are two celebrated, the second due to the double sixth lunar month, counting the year with 384 days.
In the celestial stem (Tian gan, 天干) the Yi (乙) element, wood yin, and in the terrestrial branch (di zhi, 地支) si (巳, serpent) element yin, southern direction. ) Yin wood has the fire element (Si, 巳) underneath and how wood grows fire, the fire will be fed and very strong, and even more nourished by joining the Li water (离, fire) of the period 9 [twenty years started in 2024 and ending in 2043].
Beginning at Lichun of 2025 is entered a period of three years whose dominant element is fire. In 2026, Bingwu Year (丙午), both in the celestial stem and in the earth's field has the Yang Fire element and so called the Red Horse Year. Already in 2027, Dingwei (丁未) is fire yin and then called by Red Range.
Fire represents war, volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, and links to the metal element, [melted by fire], aviation and road accidents. For health, the fire causes heart attacks (as this is fire element) and lung problems (metal element), which are the main organs affected this year.
As fire melts metal, Europe (located in the west direction, metal element) will suffer more, but Portugal wrapped in water can balance and control the intensity of fire.
As for the terrestrial branch (di zhi, 地支) SI (巳), Yin Fire element and southern direction, recognized by the year of the serpent, symbolic animal whose common name is shé (tsz, 蛇), represents for this year, diverting if the normal path. It does not follow the rules. It is also very flexible and has the sensitivity to wait to act at the right time.
Yisi Year (乙巳), yin wood, fire yin, will be financially good because the waves caused to large businesses, especially those related to wood, pharmacist, cultural and agriculture products. People like to make investments as in a game and quickly earn or lose everything.
Rotation of the five planets
For 2025, the fire li (离) of period 9, which started last year for twenty years, means separation and with a strong connection to the planet Mu Xing (木星, Jupiter) will continue to act on Earth, activating seismos, volcanic eruptions, and storms.
It will be an abnormal year due to the change of meaning in the rotation of seven planets, which in a certain period rotate in the opposite direction, in an apparent retrograde movement, because from the “point of view of the earth they seem to stop briefly and reverse the meaning of movement in certain Moments, although in reality they orbet in the same direction around the sun, ”according to information on the Wikipedia explained in the article.
Thus huo Xing (火星, Mars, the Star of Fire, Southern Direction) has already begun to run in the opposite direction (in an apparent retrograde movement) on January 7, 2025 and will continue until April 18. It will be a period of huge problems with fires and other natural calamities, linked to the fire element. This inverted rotation also occurs to Jin Xing (金星, Venus, the West Metal Star) from March 28 to April 30.
Planet Venus is linked to finance and when from March 28 to April 18, Huo Xing and Jin Xing, both overlap with reversed rotation, there will be large waves in the world economy and financial markets [Stock Exchange and the Currency exchange] will suffer with great turbulence, in a foreshadowing of financial crisis.
All remaining five planets that follow change the direction of running in the second half of the year: Tu Xing (土星, Saturn The Earth Star, Center Directorate), linked to Geology and Agriculture, from September 1, 2025 to mid -February 2026 will affect the land and create new morphologies caused by tsunamis. Lots of land will be flooded and in other parts will suffer severe dried.
In meteorology, when it is necessary cold, it is hot, when rain is needed, the intense sun shines, affecting agriculture, leading to lack of food. Already the other planets that of a progressive movement come to circulate in the other direction, in an apparent retrograde movement, opposite to the hitherto, are Shui Xing (水星, Mercury, Water Star, North Directorate); Tian Wang Xing (Uranus); Hai Wang Xing (海王星, nepturnus); Ming Wang Xing (冥王, Pluto). These changes put people to make decisions with the hot head without thinking about the problems they can create. October will be a black month due to what may happen, hopefully not the beginning of a new war.
Alert for Devir
For this year you can be a spectator, do not be actor. The wood element represents culture, being the only theme for relaxing the heart.
With climate change to raise the powers of the elements, everything comes with great intensity leading to large disasters. After the weather, World War expects only a snap of fingers to appear, come true and explode. Pandemics peek and are ready to attack. Everything is about great pressure and extreme, the economy will help a few and many will be left out due to the inflated or undervalued price of work.
Only now is it the awareness of being in the third millennium. The year 2025 will be afraid of people and with this tension the follies of the soul of fire will emerge, an element that will be perpetuated in the next two years. In the overview for 2025 this will be a difficult year, but it is just a warning of what will come in 2026.
In Yi Jing corresponds to hexagram 49, GE (HUA) in the past the skin of animals already without hair and the current means and appears to build a new system possibly through a revolution (the removal of what has become old -fashioned). Water and fire extinguish each other.
Tai sui
The God of the Year (Tai Sui) of 2025 is General Wu Sui. Born in Anhui province he was a magistrate of the Song dynasty and became known for his intelligence, compassion and ability to resolve with the sharpness of his analyzes very complex cases. This led to the governor of Xuning in Anhui in 1240. Due to an extreme drought in the region, he spent three days and nights at the Seng Vong Temple (Cheng Huang) to pray for rain, and his orders are fulfilled.
The rain appeared, but only in its region because around the drought was devastating having a lot of hunger and huge fires, bringing chaos to these areas and only the territory where I ruled had peace and stability. It was an island and having the general organized everything, the region did not fall into chaos with harmony in the population unlike other places where the lootered and only the Huaihe area were dominated to fled 400,000 people there.
With General Wu Sui as Tai Sui 2025, this year brings changes related to conflict sources enhanced by natural disasters and violent discussions, hostilities and tensions intensified by Flying Star 3 Jade (San BI) to end in court.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>José Simões Morais</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/jose-sm/</link><description>China, with an existence for seventy -eight cycles, each 60 years, in 2025 has the number 42 to correspond to Yisi (乙巳), green serpent.

In 2026, Bingwu Year (丙午), both in the celestial stem and in the earth's field has the Yang Fire element and so called the Red Horse Year. Already in 2027, Dingwei (丁未) is fire yin and then called by Red Range.
Fire represents war, volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, and links to the metal element, [melted by fire], aviation and road accidents. For health, the fire causes heart attacks (as this is fire element) and lung problems (metal element), which are the main organs affected this year.
As fire melts metal, Europe (located in the west direction, metal element) will suffer more, but Portugal wrapped in water can balance and control the intensity of fire.
As for the terrestrial branch (di zhi, 地支) SI (巳), Yin Fire element and southern direction, recognized by the year of the serpent, symbolic animal whose common name is shé (tsz, 蛇), represents for this year, diverting if the normal path. It does not follow the rules. It is also very flexible and has the sensitivity to wait to act at the right time.
Yisi Year (乙巳), yin wood, fire yin, will be financially good because the waves caused to large businesses, especially those related to wood, pharmacist, cultural and agriculture products. People like to make investments as in a game and quickly earn or lose everything.
Rotation of the five planets
For 2025, the fire li (离) of period 9, which started last year for twenty years, means separation and with a strong connection to the planet Mu Xing (木星, Jupiter) will continue to act on Earth, activating seismos, volcanic eruptions, and storms.
It will be an abnormal year due to the change of meaning in the rotation of seven planets, which in a certain period rotate in the opposite direction, in an apparent retrograde movement, because from the “point of view of the earth they seem to stop briefly and reverse the meaning of movement in certain Moments, although in reality they orbet in the same direction around the sun, ”according to information on the Wikipedia explained in the article.
Thus huo Xing (火星, Mars, the Star of Fire, Southern Direction) has already begun to run in the opposite direction (in an apparent retrograde movement) on January 7, 2025 and will continue until April 18. It will be a period of huge problems with fires and other natural calamities, linked to the fire element. This inverted rotation also occurs to Jin Xing (金星, Venus, the West Metal Star) from March 28 to April 30.
Planet Venus is linked to finance and when from March 28 to April 18, Huo Xing and Jin Xing, both overlap with reversed rotation, there will be large waves in the world economy and financial markets [Stock Exchange and the Currency exchange] will suffer with great turbulence, in a foreshadowing of financial crisis.
All remaining five planets that follow change the direction of running in the second half of the year: Tu Xing (土星, Saturn The Earth Star, Center Directorate), linked to Geology and Agriculture, from September 1, 2025 to mid -February 2026 will affect the land and create new morphologies caused by tsunamis. Lots of land will be flooded and in other parts will suffer severe dried.
In meteorology, when it is necessary cold, it is hot, when rain is needed, the intense sun shines, affecting agriculture, leading to lack of food. Already the other planets that of a progressive movement come to circulate in the other direction, in an apparent retrograde movement, opposite to the hitherto, are Shui Xing (水星, Mercury, Water Star, North Directorate); Tian Wang Xing (Uranus); Hai Wang Xing (海王星, nepturnus); Ming Wang Xing (冥王, Pluto). These changes put people to make decisions with the hot head without thinking about the problems they can create. October will be a black month due to what may happen, hopefully not the beginning of a new war.
Alert for Devir
For this year you can be a spectator, do not be actor. The wood element represents culture, being the only theme for relaxing the heart.
With climate change to raise the powers of the elements, everything comes with great intensity leading to large disasters. After the weather, World War expects only a snap of fingers to appear, come true and explode. Pandemics peek and are ready to attack. Everything is about great pressure and extreme, the economy will help a few and many will be left out due to the inflated or undervalued price of work.
Only now is it the awareness of being in the third millennium. The year 2025 will be afraid of people and with this tension the follies of the soul of fire will emerge, an element that will be perpetuated in the next two years. In the overview for 2025 this will be a difficult year, but it is just a warning of what will come in 2026.
In Yi Jing corresponds to hexagram 49, GE (HUA) in the past the skin of animals already without hair and the current means and appears to build a new system possibly through a revolution (the removal of what has become old -fashioned). Water and fire extinguish each other.
Tai sui
The God of the Year (Tai Sui) of 2025 is General Wu Sui. Born in Anhui province he was a magistrate of the Song dynasty and became known for his intelligence, compassion and ability to resolve with the sharpness of his analyzes very complex cases. This led to the governor of Xuning in Anhui in 1240. Due to an extreme drought in the region, he spent three days and nights at the Seng Vong Temple (Cheng Huang) to pray for rain, and his orders are fulfilled.
The rain appeared, but only in its region because around the drought was devastating having a lot of hunger and huge fires, bringing chaos to these areas and only the territory where I ruled had peace and stability. It was an island and having the general organized everything, the region did not fall into chaos with harmony in the population unlike other places where the lootered and only the Huaihe area were dominated to fled 400,000 people there.
With General Wu Sui as Tai Sui 2025, this year brings changes related to conflict sources enhanced by natural disasters and violent discussions, hostilities and tensions intensified by Flying Star 3 Jade (San BI) to end in court.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>António Graça de Abreu</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/antonio-graca-abreu/</link><description>(continuation of the previous number)
Goethe, who has always been passionate about Chinese civilization, glossed the old principle of Socrates, Greek, “The more I know, the more I know nothing” and wrote “man only knows when he knows little knows. With knowledge the doubt grows. ” And Confucius 孔夫子, who also knew much of the things of life and his people, said, six centuries before Christ: “If you know yourself, it acts as a man he knows. If you do not know, you recognize that you do not know; This is knowing! ”
The old Chinese, a wisdom based on five thousand years of history and stories are wise. The old Chinese, an intelligence acquired over many and many centuries hard and intensely lived, are intelligent.
Lao Zi, 老子 (600 a.
Under the sky, [1] we all see that the beautiful is beautiful
Because the ugly exists.
We all know that the good is good
because the bad exists.
Coexist being and non-being,
complete the difficult and the easy
the top and bass approach,
the voice and sound are harmonized,
the front and the back followed.
Therefore, the sage advances and does nothing, [2]
teaches without saying anything
And the ten thousand beings develop without ceasing.
He works and has nothing,
He creates and appropriates nothing.
Everything done, everything forgets,
Thus, forever, the work remains. [3]
The amazing Lie Zi 列子 (450 BC-376 A. C.) who, according to Taoist tradition was able to ride winds and clouds, says in his book, chap. II, 11:
“Two boys lived by the sea and loved the seagulls. Every morning they played in the middle of the birds and many other seagulls, to the hundreds, poisted with them. One day the father told them:
‘I know they play with the seagulls. They get some and bring them. I also want to have fun. '
The next day, the boys arrived on the edge of the sea, the seagulls hovered in the air and not left on the beach.
In conclusion, the best of all discourses is the one that does not use words, the perfect action is to act without acting, the wisdom of the wisest of the wise is always unknown ”
Another story of the book of Lie Zi, in Chapter VII, 32:
“A peasant didn't know where his ax was. He then suspected that his neighbor's son had stolen and began to watch the boy carefully. He had exactly the ways of a thief of axes, the words he pronounced sounded the thief with axes, all his behavior and attitudes were those of someone who had stolen an ax.
But suddenly, digging the earth, the peasant found his ax.
The next day the man looked again at the neighbor's son. He then noticed that the modes, words, behavior, and attitudes of the boy were by no means of those of a thief with axes. ”
Chinese wisdom has almost always escaped Western intelligence. West and East hardly interpenetrate, they look at the Sobrency, sometimes with distrust, and above all ignore.
I will mention a curious recent example:
In 1970, in his “final will,” Russian Nikita Kruchtchev wrote, about Mao Zedong: “I was never sure to understand what he meant. He thought at that time that this was related to certain aspects of the Chinese mindset and the way of thinking of the Chinese. Some statements of Mao shocked me for its simplicity, others for its complexity. I never knew safely what Mao's position. It is impossible, with the Chinese, to know in which law. ”
It is true that Russian thinking and Chinese thinking are not understood, always. The Sino-Soviet conflict, which began in the late fifty years, was, beyond political differences, a confrontation of cultures and, strange to appear in two communist countries, a conflict between various, different conceptions of the world.
A few years ago, in Beijing, my friend Li Shunbao, a fellow in Beijing's editions in foreign languages, told me a small dialogue that was locked in 1961, between Kruchtchev and Zhou Enlai, then first- Minister of China. Relations between the two countries were already quite bad and, after a sour discussion of political issues, Kruchtchev decided to be "nice" to Zhou Enlai and said to him:
“Despite the divergences, we have a lot in common. We both believe in Marxism, you are a prime minister, me too, and you and I are responsible for the government of two of the largest nations in the world. But there is a big difference between us, I am a child of peasants and you are a child of mandarins. ”
Zhou Enlai, who, in fact, was not a son but grandson of a mandarin, smiled and replied, “Sorry, this is not a difference, it is another resemblance. It means that we are both traitors. ” “TRAINORS?!… How?…” Asked Kruchtchev. "Well, both traitors because the Lord betrayed the peasants and I betrayed the mandarins."
By the way of politics and politicians, philosopher Han Fezi 韓非子 wrote 240 years before the birth of Christ:
“You can generally expect about ten honest men in each kingdom, which is an excellent average. But the state must count a hundred positions. Hence there is more official than good men to occupy them, which gives ten honest men and ninety rascals to fill all these places. It can therefore be betting that the result will be widespread disorder, more than an organized government. This is why the sensible sovereign believes in a system and not in individual abilities, has faith in a method and suspects personal probity. ”
Han Fezi was the greatest theorist of the Fa Jia 法 家 法 家, known in the West as the legislation. He would die poisoned in a prison, perhaps because he forgot one of the exemplary quotes of Confucius "The honest man tells the truth, the fool tells the whole truth." In any case, its principles would have great influence on modern China and Mao Zedong itself.
Zhuang Zi 庄 子 子 (369-286 A. C.), the greatest of the Taoist thinkers, one of the great poets of freedom, tells us this story:
“It was Zhuang Zi fishing on the river bank when two mandarins arrived by the Prince of Zhou.
-Our prince wants to see you and appoint you Prime Minister of Kingdom of Zhou.
Zhuang Zi continued to fish and, without going back to his head, replied:
"I heard that in the kingdom of Zhou there is a sacred turtle that was killed many, many years ago." The prince retains this closed turtle in the temple of the ancestors and worships his carapace. Would the turtle be like to be dead and have its remains venerated, or would you rather be alive, shaking the tail in the mud of the swamps?
“I would rather be alive, shaking the tail in the mud of the swamps, answered the mandarins.
"You can leave," said Zhuang Zi. I also prefer to shake the tail in the mud of the swamps. ”
In China, more than any other country in the world, we see how it manifests, century after century, the continuity of ideas, traditions, uses and customs.
Mao Zedong, who knew well the cultural foundation of his homeland, sometimes cited the old philosophers and the stories of popular tradition, for the benefit of the ideology he defended. This is how, in 1945, Mao speaks of one of these stories:
“In ancient China there was a fable titled 'How Yukong removed the mountains'. This fable says that in times that go there, he lived in northern China an old man named Yukong. On the south side, in front of his house, were two large mountains, Taihang and Wangwu, which prevented his passage. Driving his children, Yukong decided to rock the mountains to pick -up blows. Seeing them in such a work, another old man named Chezzou, untied to laugh and said to them, ‘What a foolishness! Alone, you will never be able to rock these two mountains. ' Yukong replied:
‘When I die will be my children; When, in turn, they die, my grandchildren will be, and thus succeeding the generations uninterrupted. As for these two mountains, however high, they can no longer grow and, with each pick of pick, they become smaller. Why can't we drag them? 'And Yukong continued, unshakable, to cut the stone, day after day, which moved the God of heaven who sent two angels to the earth who carried and took the two mountains. Today there are also two mountains that weigh on the Chinese people: imperialism and feudalism. The Communist Party of China has long decided to draft them. We must be persevering and work without rest, for we can also move the God from heaven. For us, the God of heaven is nothing but the mass of the Chinese people. ”
One of the characteristics of Chinese thinking is the unity of opposites, the complementarity and permanent transformation of opposites, movement and dialectic, the nullity of contradictions and the immediate appearance of renewed contradictions always insoluble because, when solved, they give rise to other new contradictions.
In the twenty years of the twentieth century, the philosopher Chen Lifu 陳立夫 wrote things like these:
“As men do not look like, their analogies are characterized by seven periods. In the first, the strong tolerates the weak; In the second, the strong despises the weak; In the third, the strong enslaves the weak; In the room, the strong has piety of the weak; In the fifth, the fort becomes weak; In the sixth, the weak protects the fort; In the seventh, the weak and the strong are confused. ”
Returning to Zhuang Zi and his building of Taoist wisdom, old twenty -three centuries, we read:
“The universe with this is not an expression of the absolute. Everything changes, over time, during the course of evolution, according to what begins and what ends. Science teaches that things change its appearance and that the absolute becomes relative. Therefore, the distance between large and small, between what comes before and what comes later in a chain that has no end. ”
And later, in his book by Zhuang Zi, the master says:
“Those who claim to exist the right and the righteous without their correlative, the incorrect and the unfair, or the good government without their correlative, the bad government, do not understand the great principles of the universe or the essence of all creation. How can we speak of the existence of heaven without referring to the existence of the earth, or the negative principle without referring to the positive principle?
However, there are still people who continue these endless discussions. These people are either crazy or they are naive. ”
The apparent statism of oriental civilizations has much to do with the cyclical character of their thinking. Also with his wisdom, quite different from our Western, so linked to the old Greek logic and the apparent Judeo-Christian dynamism.
Here's another antique history of Chinese Taoism, now taken from Huainanzi 淮南子, a classic of Chinese philosophy dating from the second century BC:
“An old man poor had a horse and the animal fled. At night the neighbors came to manifest their grief, telling him that he had very little luck. The peasant simply answered: 'Maybe'. The next day, the horse returned accompanied by six wild mares. At night, the neighbors came to congratulate the peasant, telling him that after all he had been very lucky. The man simply answered: 'Maybe'. The next day, the peasant son set up one of the wild mares, but fell and broke a leg. At night, the neighbors came to mourn the low luck of the peasant that simply answered: 'Maybe'. The next day, the government officials responsible for the recruitment of young people to the Army arrived at the village, finding the Empire in war time. The peasant son did not go to the battlefields because he had a leg. At night the neighbors came to congratulate him once again for his good luck and the old man simply answered: 'Maybe.'
Now an old apologist, by Pe Yu King, that no one knows who it is but has been written for fourteen centuries:
“Once a monk, a bandit, a painter, a miser, and a wise man traveled together. He fell at night and housed in a cave.
"There would be no better place for an hermitage," the monk exclaimed.
"What a great refuge for robbers," said the bad guy said.
- The light of the dock, these shadow games, which extraordinary motives for the brush!, The painter murmured in turn.
"But what a great place to hide a treasure!"
The sage heard in silence and finally said:
- What a wonderful cave! ”
In China never is nothing exactly what it seems. It may be, it may not be, it all depends on subtles or cancellations of each person, perspective, look. In the sixteenth century, in the middle of Ming Dynasty, the literate Yuan Jing 袁 晶 told the interesting story of a cat. Like this:
A mandarin of the court, named Ji, had a magnificent cat. He was so proud of the feline that he decided to call him tiger. One day, they will not be in their home with several friends, everyone started talking about the cat. One of them said:
"It is true that the tiger is a powerful animal, but the dragon has even more power." Why not call Dragon to the cat?
Another intervened:
"IDmit the dragon is more powerful than the tiger, but he has to rise in the air to reach the clouds." It seems to me therefore evident that the clouds are stronger than the dragon. Why not call cloud to the cat?
A third said then:
"The clouds can cover the whole earth, but they can't resist the wind that disperses them quickly." Why not call the cat wind?
A bedroom coexistence added:
- What can the wind before a stone wall. Why not call a wall to the cat?
A fifth friend argued later:
- A wall can resist the wind, but rats know how to bump a wall. Why not call a rat to the cat?
An old man from Dongli's village heard the whole conversation in silence. Finally, he asked:
- What is the animal that hunts rats called?
Our João de Barros (1496-1570), excellent 16th century chronicler, in its Asia, third decade, where more than one hundred pages that dedicated to China and the Chinese world, wrote around 1550:
"The Chins say they have two eyes of understanding the casters of all the things, we, the ones in Europe, after communicating us, have an eye, and all the other nations are blind."

“They are really enjoying us, we have a $ 300 billion deficit. They do not take our cars or our agricultural products, practically nothing, and we all bought millions of cars, huge levels of agricultural products, ”he said on Sunday to the press.
The European Union lamented on the same day the increase in customs rates by the United States of America about products from Canada, Mexico and China, and said it will retaliate strongly if it is targeted by unfair tariffs.
"The EU firmly believes that low customs rights promote economic growth and stability," the European Commission in a statement said through which he considered the imposition of more US tariffs as "harmful to all parties."
If the European bloc is also the target of these measures, the community executive will “retaliate strongly”. Donald Trump signed on Saturday the executive order to apply customs rates to products from Canada, Mexico and China.
The signature, which officializes the decision that had already been announced, determines the imposition of 10 percent rates to China, 25 percent to Mexico and 25 percent to Canada, except in Canadian oil, which will have a tariff of 10 by one hundred.
Trump had threatened the imposition of tariffs to ensure greater cooperation from countries to prevent illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals such as Fentanil, an opioid that is causing important additions in the United States. The three countries promise to take action.

In the case of the European Union, a decision has not yet been made, but the concern is general and France defended on Sunday a "scathing response" of Europe in the face of threats of new customs tariffs by the US President.

However, during the pandemic there was a “great variability in global satisfaction”
 
What is necessary to have a full life with happiness? The question, which can have various connotations and spiritual trends, sought to be answered and quantified by the authors of the study “Life Satisfaction Around the World: Measurement Invariation of the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) Across 65 Nations, 40 Languages, Gender Identities, and Age groups ”[Life satisfaction around the world: Invariance on Life Sounding Scale (SWLS) in 65 countries, 40 languages, gender identities and age groups].
The study, recently edited by the academic magazine “Plos One”, started from analyzes made by dozens of academics and contributors in 65 countries and regions, including China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, which makes 57,000 people analyzed.
In general terms, the authors conclude that "in all countries a greater satisfaction with life was significantly associated with financial security and the existence of a relationship of commitment or marriage." Thus, the results indicate that “greater satisfaction with life is significantly associated with greater financial security and higher educational qualifications (which may be an indicator of socioeconomic status, although the dimension of this specific relationship was insignificant)) ”.
In general terms, “these results are consistent with the evidence that indicates that the satisfaction of basic human needs and material well-being is a strong-possibly the strongest-predictor of psychological well-being and life satisfaction and life specifically".
Admittedly, the authors draw attention to the fact that the idea of ​​well-being can vary from country to country depending on the culture of populations, but the results “suggest that, when considered at the individual level, the association between satisfaction with Life and indicators of material welfare seems to be relatively robust between nations. ”
Regarding relationships, the answers hung more to the importance of not being alone. “We found that marital status was significantly associated with life satisfaction. More specifically, we found that respondents in commitment relationships were more likely to report more life satisfaction than non -married. This result is consistent with the widest literature that shows that marital status is a robust correlate of psychological well-being. ”
However, a satisfactory life is not directly linked exclusively to love relationships, and can also occur when the person has an active social life. "It has been suggested that the formation and maintenance of social relations is fundamental to the promotion of life satisfaction, particularly in cultures or communities that emphasize family values, because they satisfy a basic human need for belonging and are a source of positive affirmation." . In addition, it "reinforces healthy behaviors and protects against the impact of negative events."
Thus, the study considers it to be "likely that people living in commitment relationships can report greater emotional support and social integration, which, in turn, contributes independently to life satisfaction."
COVID-19 TIMES
If socialization is regarded as very important to a satisfactory life, as it was in times of COVID-19, which forced long periods of confinement and isolation? The study resorted to specific and statistics to evaluate the issue, concluding that there was “great variability in global satisfaction with life in the context of Covid-19 pandemic. The respondents in Canada (Francophone) and Israel had the highest SWLs and respondents in Japan and Ukraine to have the lowest averages. ”
Given the large dimension of the sample, the results allow you to conclude “that life satisfaction varied substantially among national groups at the height of the covid-19 pandemic, although the authors highlight,“ care is necessary to be careful when interpreting them Latent averages ”referred to at work so as not to advance with definitive conclusions. Still, academics understand that these data may be important to when "professionals and political decision makers try to understand differences in life satisfaction between nations," as well as being a "way to better support subjective well-being in the era Postpandmic ”.
Also noteworthy is the least life satisfaction by the minority population groups. “We found that identification as part of a racialized minority was associated with less life satisfaction. Although this is consistent with some previous works and probably reflects the deleterious effect of the experiences of racism on life satisfaction, it should be noted that the dimension of the effect of this relationship was insignificant. ”
In addition, the authors point out that “urbanity was associated with life satisfaction in a little significant way”, having been evaluated if living in a city or other urban context changed the level of satisfaction with life.
Means and purposes
To reach data from the SWLS scale described above, the “Body Image In Nature Inquiry” (Bins, English) was made by 253 scientists or academics of the 65 countries involved, who collected data between November 2020 and February 2022.
In total, 56,968 people were interviewed, 58.9 percent were women, 40.5 percent men and 0.6 percent were of another gender identity. In terms of race and ethnicity, the majority, 74.2 percent, "identified as part of a racialized majority," while 11.3 percent "identified as part of a racialized or minority ethnic group."
Regarding the site where participants live, 27 percent said living in a capital, 13.7 percent in the suburb of a capital, 25.1 percent in a province city, that is, with more than 100,000 inhabitants; While 18.7 percent said residing in a province town with more than 10,000 inhabitants. Only 15.5 percent of respondents lived in a rural area.
As for literary qualifications, 33.5 percent ended higher education, 42 percent were single and 19.5 percent were in a “commitment relationship, but were not married”. In turn, 33.5 percent were married.
Regarding financial security, 24.9 percent of participants reported feeling less safe than others of their age in their country of residence, while 49.6 percent said they felt “equally safe” and 25.5 percent They considered to be "safer".
Inquiry data allowed the study authors to “examine associations between life satisfaction and the main sociodemographic variables at the level of the individual”. Factors such as “Life Satisfaction”, “Financial Security” and “Urbanity” were evaluated, in which participants filled SWLs using a 7 -point response scale, where 1 point represented “totally disagree” and 7 points "I totally agree." Demographic data such as age, education, marital status or race were also evaluated.
With regard to China, the country is divided between “China - Cantonese”, “China - English” and “China - Mandarin”. In the case of “China - Cantonese”, regarding Hong Kong, 409 people responded, with 58 percent of women and only two percent of respondents belonging to a racial minority. All participants live in urban context, while 96 percent ended secondary or higher education. Of respondents, only two percent says it is in a relationship, whether or not marriage.
In the case of “China - Mandarin” 1,231 people participated, 69 percent of which women, in which 95 percent resides in urban areas. 86 percent of respondents have a commitment or relationship.</description><pubDate>2025-02-04 00:20:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Study | Academics highlight Christmas “egocentric” side as opposed to the lunar year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/03/estudo-academicos-destacam-lado-egocentrico-do-natal-em-oposicao-ao-ano-lunar/</link><description>A study of three Chinese academics states that while the Chinese New Year has a smaller smaller caress and "is clearly representative of contemporary Chinese society," "Christmas in the West is egocentric, exalts individuality and shows more interactivity." However, the work, published in a magazine of the State University of Bahia, points to the greater convergence of cultural characteristics
 
Chinese New Year and New Year: How are, what do they represent for the West and the East, and what are the points of convergence? It is to these questions that the study “Comparisons of cultures between Chinese New Year and Western Christmas” by Zhen Zhao, Yin Xuelu and Qiao Jianzhen intends to answer. Academic work was recently published in the magazine “Points of Interrogation - Journal of Cultural Criticism”, from the State University of Bahia, Brazil.
The authors highlight, in general terms, that "Christmas in the West is egocentric, exalts individuality and shows greater interactivity", namely with the "participation of the crowd" and demonstration of "passionate carnival emotions of people".
On the other hand, the Chinese New Year “is a national festival, clearly representative of contemporary Chinese society”. In general terms, this kind of celebrations emerges described as “a special sociocultural meaning that intersperses the daily routines”, “a concentrated exhibition of people's colorful life” as well as “a summary and extension of politics, economics, culture and religion from various regions, ethnic groups and countries. ”
They also describe the authors that the Chinese New Year, who can also be called the Lunar New Year or Spring Festival, has roots “in a small peasant economy and is often based on Confucianism, with a mix of Buddhist and Taoist culture”, being linked to "feudal religious rituals."
In turn, Christmas is presented as a larger religious component, being "rooted in Western Christian culture and embodies the values ​​of freedom and equality, original sin and individualism everywhere."
Inevitable interconnections
However, the study describes as inevitable the future exchange of cultural demonstrations at these times of the year: in the case of Christmas, in December; In the case of the Chinese New Year, during the months of January and February of each year, depending on the calendar.
"The future exchange of Chinese and Western cultures, including the festival's culture, is an inevitable part of social and historical development," is described, as well as "an evolutionary process of complementarity between Chinese and Western cultures."
Thus, the authors say, the contact points should be discovered by both cultures “from the differences between the Chinese New Year and Christmas, so that they can be promoted” and so that there is a greater preservation of “their national cultures. ”.
The authors say they note "the acceleration of cultural exchange between the East and West" in this field, as "Chinese celebrate Western festivals and foreigners celebrate Chinese festivals."
"In the age of globalization, and due to the development and deepening of economy and culture, traditional Chinese and Western parties have been gradually accepted by both peoples in mutual tolerance," reads.
Differentiating points
The three authors of the study recall that in China, the most traditional festivals have a connection with agriculture, with traditional customs based on food and drink. "The main reason for this is the pursuit of the Chinese people in going to be oriented to a long and healthy life." Meanwhile, "Western traditional festivals have mainly origin in religion and related events," therefore "strong religious connotations."
It is added that, in the West, “traditional vacation customs are based mainly on the subject of fun”, the main reason for “the pursuit of western ones in life to have the objective of health and happiness”.
In comparative terms, "both Chinese New Year and Christmas is a family reunion time and a wonderful time for people to look back and also to the future," although "with different connotations in Chinese and Western cultures."
One of the differences pointed out in the study is the way the days before these dates are celebrated. “The year's passage [in the Chinese New Year] is the time when people try to go home to their loved ones, no matter where they are. New Year's dinner is the highlight, also known as the reunion dinner, being the most important meal of the year. ”
One of the rituals goes through the sunset, “families start to light the rockets”, starting to prepare meals with this environment. “Although New Year's dinner dishes range from place to place, each dish has a certain symbolic meaning. Chinese like to use harmonics to attract good luck, and for example, chicken harmonics mean 'auspicious', while "yu" yu harmonics mean "year after year".
“New Year's Eve is a custom of the Chinese people Han. After eating the New Year's meal, people gather in family to wait for the coming of the new year at midnight, ”the authors point out, also describing that“ in many parts of China on New Year's night, People prepare sumptuous offerings, light incense and candles, pour wine and burn paper money, paying tribute to family ancestors to express nostalgia for them ”, as well as waiting for blessings“ for the sons and grandchildren of the sky, inspiring the descendants to work harder and live up to the desires of their ancestors. ”
In the case of Christmas, celebrated on December 25, the day before is marked by a family dinner that also has traditional dishes and sweets, such as the king cake, cod or roast turkey. “Unlike New Year's Chinese vigil, Westerners celebrate Christmas as a unique fantasy party on Christmas Eve who extends throughout the night. At the party there is no rigorous clothing code, just being natural and informal, climbing to say 'Hello' and sending sincere wishes [of good holidays], ”is mentioned.
Another differentiating point pointed out is the offers. If the Chinese New Year is usual the offer of money in the “Lai Si” envelopes, the western Christmas are present between family and friends.
The distribution of money in the Chinese New Year has several connotations, and there is a kind of money to the elders, serving “to wish them a long life”; While there is later the money given from the elders to the youngest, representing a care transmission from the most seniors.
In turn, “the first legends about Christmas gifts refer to the birth of Jesus,” with the offerings of the wise men. “It is currently customary to give gifts between family and friends at Christmas,” is referred to, and there is also the idea that it is Santa to distribute the gifts. “Sometimes people pretend to be Santa Claus to give gifts to children in order to add the festive spirit,” he says.
Another big difference pointed out by the study is that in the West, Christmas does not have the same connotation as ancestors. “In the West people do not worship their ancestors, and people go to church to celebrate the birth of Jesus. People are not limited to being in family meetings, but inviting [others] in a warm way to their homes, and is not considered rude partying together. During the holidays many people participate in community activities to help the poor and give gifts, reflecting the idea of ​​seeking equality. ”
Similarity
According to the study, the two celebrations have as its common point to serve to "maintain social stability." “In ancient China agricultural production was strongly influenced by the climate. Poor workers who belonged to the lower classes often had to work all year round, which inevitably led to dissatisfaction with the reality of the situation. ” In this sense, the arrival of the Chinese New Year is “a good time to release emotions”, decorating the house and lighting rockets in the creation “hope that the next year will be good, with good harvests and better days”.
With regard to Christmas, it is described that people “go to church worship [the saints], sing Christmas songs and pray to God, hoping that they will help them get out of difficulties when they are in trouble or when they are sick and face death . They expect God to forgive them for the sins so that they can ascend to heaven after death, ”there is a parallel with the“ liberation of emotions ”above.
In addition, both celebrations constitute forms of culture transmission, according to the authors of the study. “New Year's culture is an accumulation of traditional Chinese culture, being the crystallization of the work and wisdom of the Chinese people, expressing the aspirations of the hardworking people who long for good things.” In addition, these celebrations “carry and convey traditional culture in a subtle manner”, namely with paintings and other decorations of the houses, or events such as Dragon and Lion dances or handwriting sessions.
“Through these activities the extremely valuable cultural heritage is transmitted to younger generations,” is referred to. In turn, at Christmas there are the decorations of the time, with the tree, the lights or cribs, in green, red colors and other bright tones.
“People who have been busy working year returns to revive the family heat. People go to the church to celebrate the birth of Jesus, which is a regular event and an inheritance of religious culture. It has become customary to send a Christmas card to friends and family, and all these customs carry profound cultural connotations that are transmitted. ”</description><pubDate>2025-02-03 01:40:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Denmark | PM Refusal Sell Grolândia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/04/dinamarca-pm-recusa-vender-gronelandia/</link><description>Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was yesterday available to dialogue with the United States over Granelândia, stressing that the autonomous territory “is not for sale”.

In Hong Kong, only six percent of respondents are committed to their jobs
 
Realizing how workers from around the world feel, and regarding their employment, it is the objective of the Gallup International Association report, entitled “State of the Global Workplace 2024”. If in the worldwide and regional scene, East Asia does well in some indicators, the scenario is not favorable with regard to the commitment or commitment that workers have for the company they are linked to or the functions they perform.
Inside East Asia includes countries and regions such as China, Hong Kong, Japan, Mongolia, South Korea and Taiwan. This area of ​​the globe has “the lowest percentage, at regional level, of employees who feel daily sadness”, but has “the third highest, regional percentage of employees who say they are looking, and actively, of a new job. ” In addition, East Asia has “the third lower percentage at regional level of committed employees” with the work they have (18 percent, which still represents a rise of 1 percent compared to the corresponding period between 2022 and 2023) .

As for negative emotions lived daily, and more often, the stress factor leads, with 46 percent response, six percent from the period between 2022 and 2023. percent answers, which did not generate any answers in the last investigation. “Sadness” was a feeling revealed by 12 percent of respondents, 1 more percent compared to the previous inquiry, and “loneliness”, which also has direct entry into this list of less good feelings lived at work, 18 percent.
If dissatisfaction with work is demonstrated in the preceding paragraphs, certainties climb from tone in the category “work environment - good height to find a job”, with 51 percent to respond affirmatively, 11 percent of answers to the previous inquiry . In addition, the category “intention to leave - looking actively for a new work” was chosen for 54 percent of respondents, two percent less from 2022 to 2023.
In the “Life Assessment” category, those who claim to have a prosperous life are 32 percent, seven percent, in contrast to the 62 percent of respondents who claim to be suffering some kind of difficulties, another seven percent in relation to to the last inquiry. The “suffering” category related to the job was chosen for six percent of participants in the inquiry, a direct entry in this study.
Sadness below
For the study of Gallup, 40,428 people were interviewed in 41 countries, and the sample per country contains about 1,000 men and women. The margin of error of the survey “is between +3-5 percent with a confidence level of 95 percent”, is referred to.
The study also compares the data recorded by eastern Asia workers with the other countries. And once again is the lack of commitment and the feeling of “dressing the nightgown” that persists in many companies. In worldwide terms, 62 percent of the answers point to the absence of commitment, when in East Asia this percentage over 67 percent.
Regarding the “life evaluation”, if at the world level 58 percent of respondents says it is having difficulties, the percentage of East Asia is 62 percent. However, suffering meaning is only six percent of the answers, while in the world the bar is eight percent.

In the “life assessment”, 36 percent of China workers say they are facing difficulties, plus 1 percent, while in Taiwan 41 percent says they face less good times, representing a direct entry into the classification, with no previous score to compare. In the case of Hong Kong, 17 percent of respondents assume to cross difficulties, plus 1 percent compared to the previous inquiry.

About 20 percent of workers around the world “experience daily loneliness”, and this feeling “is greater among total teleworking workers”.
“In this year's report, 41 percent of workers claim to feel 'very stress'. However, stress varies significantly as a function of how organizations are managed. Those who work in companies with bad management practices (actively unmotivated) have almost 60 percent more likely to be stressed than people who work in environments with good management practices (committed). In fact, the experience of 'very stress' is referred to about 30 percent more often by employees who work under mismanagement than by the unemployed, ”said Gallup CEO.
For the official, "leaders know that stress at the workplace is a problem-they saw the data, heard colleagues and felt themselves themselves." “A quarter of the leaders are frequently exhausted or always, and two thirds feel it at least a few times. Many are trying to solve the problem, but often ineffective, ”he concludes.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:41:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Death | Died Rocha Vieira at 85</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/obito-morreu-rocha-vieira-aos-85-anos/</link><description>Vasco Rocha Vieira, the last Portuguese governor of Macau, died yesterday at the age of 85. The general had been sick for a long time. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa recalled him as “one of the most illustrious officers” of the army, but to Macau, Rocha Vieira stays for history as the great worker of the measures decided in the joint statement of 1987
 
It has long been sick, even failing some recent events in Lisbon about Macau and the transition. Vasco Rocha Vieira, General, former Chief of Staff of the Army, and last Portuguese governor of Macao, died in the early hours of 85 years old.
Born on August 16, 1939, he held the position of Governor of Macao between 1991 and 1999, when the transfer of the territory to China was processed. However, Rocha Vieira already had a connection to Macau, as he was in the territory after April 25. In addition, he was also Minister of the Republic of the Azores between 1986 and 1991.
One of the first personalities to react to his death in Portugal was the President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who expressed, in a official note, the “deep regret” for the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, recalling him as “one of the more distinguished army officials and praising its “marked patriotism”.
In a note published on the official website of the Presidency of the Republic on the Internet, the head of state recalls Rocha Vieira as "one of the most illustrious officers of the Portuguese army in the transition to democracy and in the first decades of his statement." “Always closely linked to commands, it has also performed political functions such as Minister of the Republic for the Autonomous Region of the Azores,” is remembered in the note.
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa also points out that Rocha Vieira was “very close to President António Ramalho Eanes”, having been “designated chancellor of the old military orders”.
“The symbolism of the moment of transferring the Portuguese administration to the Chinese will remain in the memory of many Portuguese as an example of meaning, meaning of the public cause and marked patriotism,” reads the note of regret.
The President of the Republic, who claims to have followed “closely the last months” of Rocha Vieira's life, “presents to his family, and, much in particular, to his widow and children, the testimony of gratitude of Portugal, with very longing friendship".
In his biography, entitled “To all the ports I arrived”, the moment Mário Soares, then President of the Republic, said to Rocha Vieira: “I need yourself. Go to Macao and see if it puts that in order ”, in reference to the case of Macau fax, related to the construction of Macao International Airport, which so many headaches gave its predecessor, Carlos Watermelon, also deceased.
The general will then replied that nothing demanded to go to Macau. “I didn't ask you anything, nor did I put it in conditions. I went to Macau with the same spirit with which I went to the Azores. It was not a political position inherent in a career. It was, in fact, a mission, ”he describes.
Then it was Rocha Vieira and his team to achieve all objectives and ideal for the future of Macao present in the joint statement that had been signed between Portugal and China in 1987. The government led by Rocha Vieira saw the airport was born, built The entire bilingual legislative framework that is still in place today and raised the Macao Cultural Center, inaugurated by Jorge Sampaio on March 19, 1999, among many other initiatives, including in the area of ​​urbanism.
A "GREAT FRIEND"
Rocha Vieira came, by the way, to make the place available to the Macau Executive when Jorge Sampaio was elected President of the Republic, at the turn from 1995 to 1996. “When I went to Macau I didn't know how things were going to run and how long I was going There stayed there, ”he recalled in his biography. However, and despite Sampaio's initial hesitation in change, the truth is that Rocha Vieira turned out to be, because “her replacement would affect the regular sequence of the process” at a time when “the passage was already in sight was already in sight From territory administration to China, ”it is described in“ all the ports I arrived ”.
Speaking to RTP, Chito Rodrigues, general who was governor of Macao in office, left words of regret for the death of the one who was a friend.
“I remember him as a great friend and honorary partner of the Combatants League. He has always related to us and is our reference. We knew it was bad and we were not, in a way, surprised [with the news of death], but it is always an unpleasant surprise. ”
Chito Rodrigues recalls him in the exercise of his duties in Macau as someone who contributed "to Macau to be a quiet place for decolonization to be done in a" exemplary "way." “I was with him at the opening of the airport and had close relations with him as governor. It was someone who replaced his predecessors successfully and humble, replacing the tradition of military governors in Macao, ”he added.
In Fernando Lima and Eduardo Cintra Torres's book “Macao Between Two Worlds”, the former Hong Kong governor, Chris Patten, recalled Rocha Vieira as “a brave and judicious man, with enormous integrity and an excellent server of his country”. "I think Portugal was very lucky to have such a good man as the last governor, such a difficult place," he said.
The controversy
The name of Rocha Vieira was, however, wrapped in some controversies, namely with the creation of the Jorge Álvares Foundation and the Oriente Foundation, especially regarding the funds allocated to these two entities. "The bulk of public opinion of the territory and the authorities of Beijing contested the legitimacy of a contract under which an entity based in Lisbon was fueled with resources generated in Macao," reads the biography of Rocha Vieira. This only intended the Foundation to “play a useful role for Macao, and the controversy has been diluted over time.
On social networks, the journalist and former director of Macau today, João Severino said “mourn a lot” the disappearance of Rocha Vieira. “General Vasco Rocha Vieira left us after several weeks hospitalized at the hospital. Macao's last governor was a good man for many people and discriminatory for many. In any case his military career was exemplary and left marks in the administration of Macao. I kept with the illustrious governor some controversial moments, always within the greatest cordiality and consideration by the maximum representative of my country in Macau. I present to your wife Dr. Leonor and his children my condolences and rest in peace, ”he wrote.
An entity that reacted to the disappearance of Rocha Vieira was the Luso-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCILC), which on social networks issued a note of regret about the death of the 138th Portuguese Governor of Macao and presided at the CCILC Strategic Council.
“General Rocha Vieira played a striking and exemplary role throughout his life, standing out for his commitment to service to the nation, dedication to relations between Portugal and China, and the historical role in closing the administration cycle Portuguese in Macau. ”
The same note also states that "in the leadership of the CCILC Strategic Council, his strategic vision, wisdom and human values ​​have always been a source of inspiration for the entire direction and executive team."
Also the Lisbon City Council officially reacted to its disappearance. “Rocha Vieira dedicated her life to the defense of the national interest, notably serving Portugal as the army's head of the army and as the last governor of Macao. Vision statesman assured a peaceful transfer from Macao sovereignty to China. Man of courage, contributed to the consolidation of the democratic process, being a fundamental piece of November 25, 1975. It was an honor to count on his testimony in the first evocation ceremony of November 25 in the Paços do County in 2023. ”
Goodbye to Macau
The images of Rocha Vieira to hold the Portuguese flag to her chest are celebrated on December 19, 1999, with a visibly thrilled face, as well as goodbye to the “mission” he agreed to perform in Macao.
After his role as governor, Rocha Vieira was maintaining narrow ties with the territory, and the last time he was in Macau was in 2023, to receive the distinction of Honoris Causal Doctorate from the University of Science and Technology of Macao.
Then he stressed that the "good historical relationships" with China are "a trump card for Portugal" and that today the country is "a superpower in affirmation". The general said that “another great asset” for Portugal is interest in China in the Portuguese language, underlining the growing number of Chinese universities that teach Portuguese. At the end of 2020, the coordinator of the Portuguese Language Pedagogical and Scientific Center of the Macao Polytechnic University, Gaspar Zhang Yunfeng, said there were about 50 higher education institutions with Portuguese courses in mainland China.
“China is interested in that Portuguese develops (…) also to be able to have, through Portugal, a narrower relationship with Portuguese -speaking countries,” said Rocha Vieira.
In a last interview with Lusa agency in 2019, Rocha Vieira recalled the times in Macau and her vicissitudes, especially regarding the transition process.
“I had more problems with the Portuguese part than with the Chinese part (…) often, for lack of perception. Normally, people are far away in Lisbon - this is a historical thing, which is not just now - and think they know the solutions better than those in Macao, ”he said.
Rocha Vieira assured that when it was necessary to define “the course, the fundamental objectives of Macao policies, were discussed by the Macao government in Lisbon, with whom they should be discussed, with the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister”, there is “always” about this “a great understanding on the part of the Portuguese sovereignty organs and a great proof of confidence in those in the territory”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:26:24</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Trump says tariffs are "the only form" in the country being "treated as it should"</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/eua-trump-diz-que-tarifas-sao-a-unica-forma-do-pais-ser-tratado-como-deve/</link><description>European countries will be subject to customs tariffs, "the only form" of the United States "being treated as they should be," US President Donald Trump said Tuesday.

In statements cited by the newspaper or Mun, the appointed deputy justified the good performance of the sector with the increase in the number of excursions to visit the territory and the occupancy rate of the hotel rooms above 90 percent.
The deputy's statements arise in a context in which the average visitors along the holidays of the Lunar New Year is being below the expectations of the Tourism Services Directorate. In late January, Helena de Senna Fernandes had predicted a daily average of 185,000 tourists during the days of the Lunar New Year. By the end of the seventh day of the festivities had entered Macau 1,172,355 people, which represented a daily average of 167.5 thousand tourists.
As part of the positive balance of tourism performance, the deputy and entrepreneur indicated that prices were only slightly more expensive than last year, but he told that one cannot speak of excessive prices, taking into account the offer of hotels. At the same time, he pointed out that there were no problems or complaints about the services provided.
Cheung Kin Chung also stated, according to the newspaper or Mun, that the "quality" of tourists has increased because they visit more cultural, historical places and experience different types of food.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 01:02:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Sport | Au Kam San Critica Estoril Pool Closing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/desporto-au-kam-san-critica-encerramento-da-piscina-estoril/</link><description>Former deputy Au Kam San criticized the closing of the Estoril pool, due to the construction works of the new central library. The criticism was published in an online comment.
With a closing time that can range from three to five years, depending on the completion of the project, Au considered that the administration must have opted for a different solution that kept the facilities open. The former deputy also argued that it was incomprehensible that the only pool in the most central area of ​​the territory was closed over such a long period.
On the other hand, it also left the possibility that the closing decision was avoided if the facilities were explored by a private individual, rather than being managed by the Sports Institute. “Let's imagine that it was a trader who explored the pool and that next to it a building was built. Had this government ever suggested to this merchant the suspension of the operation of the pool? How would the merchant answer? ”He asked.
Au Kam San opined that closing was not the only solution available and that the pool could be working as long as safety measures were taken.
The former deputy also stated that the decision results from the development of a bureaucratic culture in the administration to make the slightest effort to avoid taking responsibility if errors occur. “The most important thing is not to take responsibility, no matter what people have to stop swimming or the facilities are abandoned. Closing should only have been weighted as a last resort solution, ”reads the publication.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 00:59:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Concerts | Chan Iek Lap wants more security in selling tickets</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/concertos-chan-iek-lap-quer-mais-seguranca-na-venda-de-bilhetes/</link><description>Chan Iek Lap is concerned about the black market and asks for the reinforcement of supervision and the fight against the phenomenon. The deputy suggests that the government requests social networks to remove publications to sell tickets
 
Deputy Chan Iek Lap advocates the need to implement security systems against fraud on selling concert tickets. The subject was approached through a written interpellation, in which the member of the Legislative Assembly is concerned about increasing the mockeys and sales of tickets in the black market.
According to the data presented by the deputy, only in the latest times, police authorities received complaints from various residents and citizens of the interior of China who were deceived when they tried to buy tickets for concerts in the territory. The values ​​of the latest slips exceeded 110,000 patacas.
In Macao, in the image of what happens in Hong Kong, tickets made available for sale to the public are reduced and rapidly run out, as they are reserved in advance, or due to the use of software by black market sellers that flood the sites from sale.
As a result, stakeholders end up buying tickets on the black market, where they pay higher prices or gaps, which happens when they pay for tickets they never receive.
“This situation has become a widespread concern of the population, especially the problem of the increasing black market,” writes Chan Iek Lap. “Given the increasing number of frauds in ticket sales, the government intends to review the ticket management system and reinforce the legal system of buying and selling concert tickets, in order to avoid the occurrence of similar fraud ? ”Asks the deputy.
Currently, according to the deputy, the illegal sale of tickets can be punished with a prison penalty up to three years or a fine of not less than 120 days.
Line for complaints
As part of the effort to combat the black market, the deputy also wants to know if the police will create contact points exclusively to receive complaints about the black market.
On the other hand, Chan Iek Lap asks if there is a possibility that the government intercede with companies owners of social networks to prevent the sale in the black market. “The government is intended to reinforce cooperation with social networking platforms and demand them to examine ticket information and delete illegal messages?” He asks.
The deputy also asks if the government is planning measures to avoid the use of the black market, where consumers are fragile, and organize awareness campaigns to alert the public.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 00:57:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Neighborhoods | More support requests for traders</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/bairros-pedidos-mais-apoios-para-comerciantes/</link><description>Choi Hong Law, vice president of the Macao North Industrial and Commercial Association, defended more support for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in community neighborhoods, pointing out that they did not benefit enough during the Chinese New Year period.

Two weeks after Lo Choi in suggested the end of the attribution of the checks to those who are out of Macau, Ron Lam shares the same opinion and asks if the measure is a support or dividend department
 
Less than a month and a half after Sam Hou Fai's inauguration as the Chief Executive, the question of cutting in the distribution of pecuniary checks returned to the agenda. Ron Lam understands that the government should explain the original intent and definition of the reimbursement program, clarifying whether the measure is financial support or dividend distribution. Ron Lam's statements asking for conceptual clarifications, published yesterday in the newspaper or Mun, were provided with possible “later adjustments” to the measure.
The deputy argues that, as supported by the beneficiaries of the non -compulsory central social security regime, the distribution of pecuniary checks must be limited to those who remain in the territory at least 183 days in a year.
It is recalled that the “pecuniary reimbursement plan in economic development” has been presented by the government as a way to “share with the population the fruits of economic development”.
Regardless of the objective referred to every year by successive executive, since 2008, Ron Lam states that public policies need to have concrete objectives and directions to ensure efficient execution and adjustments with scientific accuracy. These are the priorities pointed out by the deputy, before deciding changes to the amount attributed and if the distribution is cut to residents living outside Macao. However, it underlines that the cancellation of the program is not realistic.
The age of why
If the pecuniary check concerns the sharing of the fruits of economic development, which explains its distribution during the pandemic when the territory plunged into an economic crisis and budget deficit? The deputy points out that during the three years of pandemic, the government did not make the usual capital injections in the individual accounts of the non -compulsory central social security regime. Despite saying that he did not agree with the suspension of capital injections, Ron Lam indicated that the government must clearly clarify the nature of its policies.
Ron Lam recalled that about 100,000 residents who do not live in Macao benefit from the pecuniary check.
According to data from the budgetary proposals for the economic year of 2025, cited by the deputy, the public was saved 79.32 million patacas with checks that were not deposited within three years. Ron Lam pointed out that the government should verify if recipients who have not changed the check are still alive.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 00:49:09</pubDate></item><item><title>DSPA | Requests improvements in the reuse of old clothes</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/04/dspa-pedidas-melhorias-na-reutilizacao-de-roupas-antigas/</link><description>Deputy Si Ka Lon expects the government to improve the current mechanism for reuse of old clothes, to prevent people without needs from taking the donated clothing.
The subject was approached through a written interpellation, in which the deputy linked to the Fujian community argues that the government should do a study, to realize how residents buy clothes, use and undo them, as well as the rate of reuse.
In addition, Si argues that DSPA should distribute prizes to those who give more reuse clothes. Si Ka Lon also pointed out that the government should stimulate clothing sales stores to participate in the reuse of old clothes.</description><pubDate>2025-02-04 00:43:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Refreshing vulvar and shame</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/refrescantes-vulvares-e-a-vergonha/</link><description>Recently, a celebrity in Portugal has launched a product that has given to talk, generated numerous posts and even made some paint. It is an intimate bruma, suggestively called Pipy, available by 29.90 euros. The goal? Refresh and somehow empower women to feel good with their bodies.
I always suspect the media of certain products. This was undoubtedly created "to ask them." The usual criticism followed: feminists with the customs of the custom-many of which I subscribe to soul and heart-supported by health professionals. These are recurring discourses, because reality persists: there is a whole industry that thrives at the expense of female insecurity. Society insists on generating a feeling of dedequation in relation to normal body processes. If you want to refresh your vulva, wash it with water-the effect will probably be the same.
In addition, products like this, created from an artificial need, can bring more problems than solutions. The vagina has a sophisticated cleaning system and doesn't need new formulas to “clean yourself better”. Interfering with this balance can cause pH imbalances, making the intimate zone more susceptible to infections such as candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis. And then, yes, smell and discomfort become a clinical problem.
 What bothers me is the discursive dance around these themes. On the one hand, there are those who see the existence of a product as an act of empowerment; On the other, there are those who, tirelessly, try to educate for a healthier relationship with the body. Now one thinks that there is a product is to empower the vulves, while others try to educate for happy vulvas. And we stayed like this. The latter preach for the deaf, and the first preach stupidity.
What is the discursive opportunity of these vaginal refreshing, what pedagogical opportunities are we waste? A sincere conversation about people's badness. Why do people feel the need to buy products to hide the natural smell of their private parts? Although manufactured, insecurity and discomfort are still real, touching a sensitive point of existence: the shame.
Shame is a complex emotional system, based on beliefs that have been blaming the vulves because they are as they are. Also based on millennial discursive traditions. In ancient Greece they explained that men had a less poignant smell than women, and so they needed more delicate perfumes, and women perfumes that best covered their natural aroma.
Dealing with shame is not easy - it requires delicacy. Explain that this is a manufactured shame does not make it disappear by magic. Continuous experiences of understanding are needed so that shame dissolves and becomes a true state of empowerment. Pipy is pseudo-popping because it works like a fast, temporary relief for deeper insecurity. The discussions that we have watched also perpetuate ideological chapels, easy to predict, without great emotional and empathic depth.
This will be only one of many articles written about Pipy, but perhaps the only one with the modest purpose of claiming that shame is being seen and understood. We were taught to be ashamed of the vulva. To unlearn, to achieve real empowerment, we have to look at this shame with affection and understanding. This recognition would be a first step to collective liberation. Only then will we leave the vulves finally at peace.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Australia interdicts social networks to children under 16 (i)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/04/australia-interdita-redes-sociais-a-menores-de-16-anos-i/</link><description>The Australian Senate approved on November 28, 2024 the change to the “Internet Security Law (minimum age for access to social networks), banning children under 16 to use most social networks. The new law does not provide for exceptions for users under 16. Therefore, as soon as changes enter into force, under 16 years should immediately stop using social networks, otherwise they will be infringing the law. This prohibition extends to young people who are allowed by parents to use networks.
The new law also requires social networking companies to take measures to prevent children under 16 from accessing their platforms, and prohibits them to oblige children to present identification documents for age verification. The maximum fine for companies that violate the new law is $ 50 million Australian (approximately RMB $ 250 million or HK $ 235 million). It is expected that the new law be tested by 2025 and fully implemented by 2026.
Although the new law does not specify which companies will be regulated, the Australian press advances that companies like Facebook, Instagram and X will be very affected.
The purpose of the new law is clear. Children can have access to all kinds of scientific and technological knowledge through social networks, allowing them to open horizons and make friends everywhere. However, there are also many disadvantages, such as being easily exposed to misinformation, contacting strangers and endangering. If young people are annoyed and eager for spending too much time on the internet, or even avoiding social life, the consequences will be even more serious. Since children are still developing mentally and physically, any negative effects of the use of the internet should be avoided.
The content of the new law is simple, but from the point of view of its effective functioning, there are many issues that deserve to be discussed.
First, Australia is not the first country to enact legislation in this matter. In Europe, many countries have already restricted children's access to social networks. For example, in France, children under 15 need parents to create social networks, children under 11 are prohibited from using mobile phones and children under 13 cannot use mobile phones with access to Internet. Norway has established 15 years as the minimum age for young people to use social networks. Below the age of 15, parental consent is necessary.
In Germany and Belgium children's access to social networks is only allowed after 13 years, and in Italy after 14. Germany and Italy also established parental consent, but Belgium not.
In Asia, on January 20, 2025, Indonesia announced that it would follow Australia and would prepare legislation to restrict the use of social networks to children from 13 to 17, while parents of children aged 13 to 15 can control the social networking accounts of children. As mobile phones become more popular, the issue of children's access to the internet and social networks has attracted more and more attention. Probably more countries and regions will legislate in this area.
Secondly, the new law sets the minimum age of 16 to access the internet, which is not the strictest standard. In Florida, the age limit established by the legislation is 14 years. It is not surprising for different countries to establish different ages to allow access to social networks. However, Florida's law restricts the use of social networks to children under 13, having been accused of limiting freedom of expression, which triggered a judicial process. After the new law is implemented in Australia, will there be similar processes to those of Florida ?? This is the risk that the Australian government may have to run after the introduction of the new law.
Next week, we will continue this analysis.

Not complying with this desiderate becomes just another person who does not comply with what he swore in a possession ceremony. It becomes an disregarded and fragile citizen before the Portuguese to continue to perform his role as Minister, Secretary of State, Deputy or President.
Last week, after several “cases and houses”, identical to what the PSD accused the government of António Costa, such as what happened in INEM and in certain cases of AD mayors who now resigned, this government of Luís Montenegro was confronted with the first resignation of one of its members in just one year in office.
The Secretary of State for Local Administration and Planning of Territory, Hernani Dias, filed the resignation. Allegedly being suspected of old and recent fraud. It has happened that this gentleman has long been investigated by the European Attorney's Office for alleged irregularities committed during his term as Mayor of Bragança, including suspicions of receipt of improper counterparts. Not complying with the severity of the situation agreed to be ruler with the pelro that recently defined the new soil law.
Hernani Dias, Chico-Esperto, has rushed to create two real estate and real estate construction companies. So, the ruler becoming aware of which rustic land through the interior of the country was to found two companies that could compete for land that were turned into real estate? Great vision of “statesman”… Hernâni Dias asked for the resignation and the Prime Minister immediately accepted. The people say that there is no smoke without fire and in fact the installed controversy is reason to be because the incompatibility in question is blatant.
Hernani Dias has denied any illegality, ensuring that he has always acted “with total transparency” and is willing to collaborate with ongoing investigations. "In political life it is necessary to have the manner of making decisions," he said, stressing that his continuity in office could harm the government's work. These statements give us only want to laugh. Transparency? Much, if we meet the investigation of the European Prosecutor's Office and the creation of two companies as a ruler related to properties possible to be built in places that Hernani Dias himself became aware of the new soil law.
Irony is still greater when it claims that it is necessary to have “manage to make decisions”. Decisions? That we knew their decisions were to have received counterparts as a mayor and create real estate companies after knowing the content of the new soil law. Its decision to resign only arises following news that indicates for a possible conflict of interest due to the alleged creation of companies that could benefit from the legislative changes promoted by its ministry. Clear, like water. The Secretary of State has resigned because he knows he is under suspicion and to be investigated. The rest are bullshit.
The country cannot be governed by greedy. By individuals who put their interests above the interests of the people and who only serve the state positions for cambalachos who illegally enrich them. For decades we have seen such cases and do not end the options for the irregular function of state server.
The sad lark becomes more substantial when Hernâni Dias justified Lusa that his departure was a "act of responsibility" to ensure the stability of the government and preserve the image of the prime minister… Act of responsibility? We will call the act a obligation to go out the back door full of shame. As an aggravating factor, the former secretary of state still had the disappointment of throwing himself against the media claiming that a campaign of “misinformation” has been underway… misinformation? So what happens in the European Attorney's Office is misinformation? Are real estate companies created by themselves, as ruler, are misinformation? Indeed, journalists are a roguish who publicize each truth…
And we are right that this dismissal was only the first in a government where health and internal administration ministers have long had to resign the positions, by indecent and bad figure. In a government where a lawyer linked to the real estate business is that he was hired as a legal consultant in the elaboration of the new soil law…
In addition, credible sources said that because it was RTP to disclose the case of the companies created by the ruler, that RTP will be the target of privatization faster than planned. If so, we are facing another case of revenge served coldly, because with a privatized RTP we cannot think that freedom of information will continue…
The same RTP also advanced that one of the real estate societies was constituted in conjunction with the ruler's wife and children in question, while the second company has as a minor a minor… all “transparent”, as the former governor said. And this is how this Portugal of ours continues to be governed, always with the cover of possible suspicions, accusations, trials and appeals behind judicial appeals. Ai, Portugal, Portugal…</description><pubDate>2025-02-03 02:59:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Order violation (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/30/violacao-por-encomenda-ii/</link><description>Last week, we analyzed the case of the French citizen who drugs his woman to unconscious since 2011, later causing it to be violated by more than 70 men. Because these events took place for a long time, the police were only able to identify, beyond their husband, 50 of the violators. The main suspect was eventually sentenced to 20 years in prison. Although the other 50 defendants had claimed that they thought they were participating in a consensual sexual game organized by the couple, the argument was not accepted by the court and were sentenced to penalties 3 and 15 years in prison.
The woman began by requesting the divorce and then attended in court, asking them to exhibit before the hearing the videos that proved that she had been violated over and over again.
This case also led the French government to review the legislation on the crime of violation by adding to the original definition the expression “principle of sexual consent”. Sexual relations should only happen when the parties involved give their consent. This review has two consequences. First, if, at any time, the woman expresses the willingness to stop the relationship, the partner must respect that will. Otherwise, you will be violating the principle of sexual consent and practicing a violation. Second, the magazine law stipulates that women should consent to sexual intercourse, otherwise it cannot occur. In this way, the husband has no right to give consent in the name of the wife. In this case, the argument of the accomplices - that the husband had consented to the violations - is no longer valid. Therefore, French legislation in this regard is clearer and fairer and legal protection given to women increases. Of course, it is the responsibility of the law to treat people fairly and equitably.
A group of women entitled “The Warriors of Avignon” applauded his wife whenever she came out of court and publicly supported her cause. Blandine Deferencies, the group's founder, said: “This woman showed great dignity and courage. He chose to speak before everyone, including the violators, which was a gift for French women. ” At the same time, the BBC considered that it was part of the list of the “top 100 of the world's most inspiring and influencing women” in 2024. These honors show the respect that it has made its history public and to fight for women's rights.
But this was not the most serious case of violation. Another height occurred at the same time that took place in Singapore. In the case of Singapore, the crimes occurred between 2010 and 2018. The suspect, which we will designate here for “J”, was part of a forum for the exchange of couples and the sharing of sexual faithfulness. Subsequently, he drugged the woman to fall asleep, sold her and contacted other members of the forum to go to her home to violate her. After that, the attackers began to use the same method and also drug women and contacted each other to violate them thus satisfying their wicked sexual appetites. They also installed hidden chambers so that group members who were not present could see the violations. The poor women were in a coma, without any notion of what was going on. It was only New Year's Eve of the 2020s that the wife of “J” accidentally discovered records of conversations and indecent photos on her husband's mobile phone and later exposed the case publicly.
All defendants were eventually convicted. "J" was sentenced to 29 years in prison and 24 whip. The other defendants received penalties that ranged from 3 to 22 years of jail and 3 of them were also vergastined. The whipping are a physical punishment applied to criminals in Singapore. Information available on the internet shows that after being whipped 24 times, the criminal's buttocks were covered with whip brands. The injuries were very deep and not only bleed, but also exposed several layers of skin and muscle. The defendant did not deal with the wound and only covered the buttocks with a towel. You will not be able to sit down, you will always have to stand. Who witnessed this punishment almost passed out.
In the French case, the husband did not violate the women of the accomplices. His behavior was intended to satisfy his inappropriate psychological needs. But in the case of Singapore, the main suspect and his accomplices violated each other's women. It is absolutely appropriate to consider this case "extremely serious".
After the trial, which took place last December 19, the woman stated: “I hope that from the beginning of this judgment that occurred on September 2, society can realize what is going on. I never regretted my decision. Now I have absolute confidence in the effectiveness of our joint efforts. I believe that united we can create a future so that all - women and men - can live in harmony, respect and mutual understanding. ”
Violation is a criminal act that goes against the victim's will. If all victims are willing to witness against the perpetrator, the number of violations will decrease a lot. The harmonious, respectful, and understanding society that Singapore's woman aims can be within our reach.
Next week, we'll cover another topic.

“A loss of incalculable dimensions for Portuguese literature, poetry, journalism, and feminism, to whom Maria Teresa Horta has proudly dedicated much of her life,” reads the editor to Lusa.
In the same text, Don Quixote regrets “the disappearance of one of the most notable and admirable personalities” of Portuguese literature, “recognized defender of women's rights and freedom, at a time when it was not always easy to assume it, author of a work that will be forever in the memory of several generations of readers. ”
In December, Maria Teresa Horta was included in a list prepared by the British BBC public station of 100 most influential and inspiring women from around the world, which included artists, activists, lawyers or scientists.
In 2022, in the 50th anniversary of the work “New Portuguese Letters”, written with Maria Isabel Barreno and Maria Velho da Costa, Maria Teresa Horta stated, in an interview with Lusa, that the book was always disregarded in Portugal and was confessed “perplexa” with the interest raised five decades after publication.
“New Portuguese Letters”, written by Maria Isabel Barreno, Maria Teresa Horta and Maria Velho da Costa, from the love letters addressed to a French officer by Mariana Alcoforado, constituted a libel against the pre-pre-ideology in the pre-period April 25, which denounced the colonial war, the oppressions to which women were subject, a persecutory judicial system, emigration and fascist violence.
It began to be written in May 1971 and was published in April 1972, having been banned by the dictatorship and its authors taken to trial.
Until the end, the three refused to reveal and no one knows the authorship of each text individually, as Lusa Maria Teresa Horta, who contested a something widespread idea that most would be Maria Velho da Costa. “They were written by the three. No one will say [who wrote each text]. They are already dead and I neither killed nor live who wrote, because we made a vow, ”he said in 2022.
Active life
Born in Lisbon in 1937, Maria Teresa Horta attended the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon, was leader of ABC Cine-Clube, activated militant in the movements of female emancipation, journalist of the newspaper A Capital and leader of Women magazine.
As a writer, she made her debut in the field of poetry in 1960, but built a literary course also composed of novels and short stories. With books edited in Brazil, in France and Italy, Maria Teresa Horta was the first woman to perform driving functions in Cineclubism in Portugal and is considered one of the exponents of Lusophony feminism.
It has been widely awarded throughout its literary career, highlighting, in recent years, the Authors 2017 Award, in the Best Poetry Book category, for “Annunciations”, the Cultural Merit Medal with which the Ministry of Culture distinguished it in 2020, the Póvoa Casino Literary Prize, which won in 2021 for the work “Strangeness”, and the decoration in 2022, with the degree of great officer of the Order of Liberty by the President of the Republic.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 01:33:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Music | Gisela João edits album “Naked” in defense of Liberdade</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/musica-gisela-joao-edita-album-inquieta-em-defesa-da-liberdade/</link><description>Portuguese fadista Gisela João is back on albums with “restless”, a work that celebrates freedom and is a tribute to April 25. The discographic work, with many songs by Zeca Afonso, goes out to stores this Friday
 
Gisela João's new album, “Trees”, coming out on Friday, honors April, is for freedom and on the impact of freedom on daily life.
“I want to make it very clear that my intention with this album is greater than the date itself, it is greater than all this, it is to remember the people that our freedom,” the freedom of each of us, imposes “taking care of Freedom ”that“ is ours and our neighbor ”, that freedom“ has an impact directly on other people's life and freedom, ”the fadista said in an interview with Lusa agency.
The album reflects the series of shows that the singer performed for the country last year, at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of April 25. To Lusa, the fadista said she felt “need to record these songs, to sing freedom”, the uppermate freedom.
About the album alignment, mostly, consisting of songs from José Afonso's repertoire, Gisela João stated that “he was made to look at the world”, what is happening around him and, “feeling almost as a spirit of mission , to sing the freedom of defending it, to give these words again to the public, ”because" they are very necessary letters and we need to hear them. "
Gisela João recorded José Afonso's repertoire with new musical arrangements, songs such as “See Bem”, “Death came out on the street”, “What Love doesn't deceive me”, but also by Paulo de Carvalho, “and after the goodbye” - Song Which was one of the passwords for the Strike of April 25, 1974 -, by Sérgio Godinho, “What a strength is this friend”, by Fernando Lopes -Graça, “Wake up!”, which the composer debuted with the choir of the amateur gym academy of music, and José Mário Branco, “restlessness”.
Always fight
The singer defended the need for "a constant struggle" and "a very concrete defense of freedom that is a right by birth." "The right of anyone who is born to freedom, the freedom to be what one wants to be, and to be the one who is desired and who dreams," he argued.
Gisela João highlighted the current repertoire she recorded and her creators, which marked Portuguese music in recent decades. "These authors - José Afonso, Sérgio Godinho, Fausto - could have written these songs today," he said.
"If we hear the news and go out to the street and look with eyes to see what goes on, it is very easy to fit phrases from these authors or the whole songs and sing them, because they fit the time we live."
Gisela João warned of the need for a vigilance, for “freedom is not an acquired data” “freedom - to be all free - allows him to hear and see things that should not happen. And who defends this freedom? We must be us every day to defend our freedom and that of others, ”he said. "A complex situation," he said, "but a necessary and constant debate."
Zeca, the Genius
Recognizing the importance of José Afonso's civic and political intervention, author of most of the songs of "restless", Gisela João stressed the "genius" of her musical creativity, which referred to as "impressive".
“The quality of the melodies he has done, [all] has something that is the hardest to do; Doing things that seem so simple and are of immense depth. That's why I can guarantee that I don't know anyone who these melodies do not touch, do not talk to people. ”
"They are very simple melodies, but they are not really, they are very dense, and they touch people, that is what makes people feel something on the skin," he added, noting that "there is a very Portuguese signature in these songs."
“There are [in those songs] - neither, I can explain how - anything that makes me feel very Portuguese, as in fado,” said Gisela João, who confided that when he hears them, it seems that he is making a mantra with himself: “One one Cantilena in repetition that is calming my soul. ”
Asked about the responsibility she feels when interpreting these songs, the fadista said that when she begins to sing is as if she was not there. “What is there is the poem; And I wish I could take people to where I go when I'm singing. ”
“The truth is that the poems are much bigger than me, and together with the perfect melodies for them, for the words to sound like they need to sound. They are much bigger than me. I feel like I get in the background. I just feel like a vehicle to give to words what they need, and to make them reach people, ”he told Lusa.
The interpreter highlighted the musical arrangements, “most airy”. And among the ten songs that constitute the alignment, he referred to his difficulty in finding the way he sing “and after the goodbye” (José Niza/José Calvário), to distance himself from the interpretation of his creator, Paulo de Carvalho.
Gisela João argued that “each one is unique” and that when he sings, he has to “know how to speak”. What sings, make yours. "I have to feel that," he emphasized.
For the interpreter, “and after the goodbye”, in the interpretation of Paulo de Carvalho, “it's perfect, it's round, that's it,” which made her “very restless”, because “she didn't want to sing like him or to do to Paulo de Carvalho ”.
“Suddenly, to read the poem so much and, related to the phase of life in which I find myself, I needed to sing it to me, deconstructing the poem and not talking about one love relationship with each other; Looking in a different way and talking about the love relationship I have with myself, where I am, where I want to go, who I am, how many of me I left along the way, which of me I want to rescue, ”he said .
"Sorry for the boldness and immodesty, but this song, I recorded it to me, and I will be very happy to know if someone, when hearing it, wants to make a point of situation of himself." “The Brave”, “Fall Ballad” and “Pack of Pack of Packet” are also part of the alignment of “restless”, with arrangements by Luís' Twins' Pereira, Gisela João, Carles Reds Martinez, and executive production and recording of Luís' Twins' Pereira.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 01:28:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Beyoncé wins Grammy of album of the year with "Cowboy Carter"</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/04/beyonce-conquista-grammy-de-album-do-ano-com-cowboy-carter/</link><description>Beyoncé won the Grammy to the album of the year for the first time in his career by "Cowboy Carter," the Academy Recording announced during the 67th edition of the awards, held at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.

According to data from the Macao Light Metro Society, the average passenger increased 9.5 percent compared to December, and rose 80.7 percent compared to the January 2024 registration.

Kuok Cheong U said the birth rate “continues to fall” has also expected to expect the birth rate to fall
 
According to Radio Macau's Chinese channel, the Kuok Cheong U Health Services Sub-director reported the record of 284 newborns in both hospitals in the territory until Monday, 17 less than in the same period as 2024.
After visiting the first baby born in the lunar year of the serpent, which began on Wednesday, the leader said he hoped the birth rate "continues to fall" and added that "it will be good" if the number of births reaches 3,500. If Kuok's forecast is accurate, this will be the least fertile year since 2004, when the city recorded 3,308 births.
According to official data, 3,712 births were recorded in Macau, 43.5 percent than 10 years ago (6,571) and far from a maximum of 7,913 set in 1988, which was a Lunar year of the dragon.
Considered a symbol of royalty, fortune and power and the only mythical figure among the 12 signs of the Chinese Zodiac millennial, the dragon sign brings together a set of characteristics that traditionally leads couples to plan to have children during this period.
By the way, the father of the first newborn at Kiang Wu Hospital, nicknamed Yip, told local press that his son was born later than expected and that the couple was telling that it was still "a Dragon Baby."
Economic concerns
Although 2024 was considered an auspicious year, Tao Xuemei and Wong Chio Fan, a young couple, told Lusa that the personal and Chinese coffers do not allow this step.
“We are concerned to have children because of national debt, due to economic recession. The option for motherhood really depends on the country's economic capacity and the debt payment capacity, ”says Tao, 28, to work as a school advisor. “We don't want to have children just to pass them [our] debts,” adds Wong, a 35 -year -old contractor.
China's economic growth reached in 2024 the 5 percent goal set by Beijing, but some economists claim that the economy is expanding at a slower pace than indicated in official estimates.
Nicholas Chen, Creditsights analyst, told Lusa that the company of the Financial Notation Agency Fitch group expects a slowdown to 4.7 percent this year, in part due to weak private consumption.
During the election campaign, the new head of the Executive of MSAR admitted that one of the biggest long -term challenges is low birth, which in 2023 reached a historical minimum of 0.59 births per woman. Sam Hou Fai pointed to the need to “create conditions in terms of education and employment” to climb birth and promised to study the extension of the maternity leave, currently fixed in 70 days, and the creation of a compulsory central action fund.</description><pubDate>2025-02-03 02:13:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us around the house, pies us his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on violations in Ukraine in this “special operation”), an act that he forced us to watch, and then we tell him: High There we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You haven't said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - Madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unambiguous moral implication in the phrase “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is managed to seek a reason for Things abroad to us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicidou -If and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ that had not entered the story. »
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when you announced the Nobel Prize in this year's literature, I couldn't help but remember this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, compared to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large newspaper Daily National Wrote wrote Five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize of Literature was awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete unknown. But unknown to whom? How did not happen to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners - I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example - but that only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone is He knows and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from him.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I also preferred that in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have been awarded. Les années ”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday an article came out in Maputo's morning “News”, to realize that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho Award Coast.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but to be highlighted simply that we "we do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”).

O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the mountain of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most undevailed ambitions, if they are fortunately fortunate to glimpse a fuxi, it is true that the fields will be triggered soon and the fields will be triggered by it Cultivated, it will be beheaded the meek animals, by it will be sacrificed the best young men of two generations and destroyed the pride of countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the midst of Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneousness and frankness were coarcet in relationships in relations Human, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a "essence", therefore declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, "one and absolute". Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as António Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter My Dear Friend: You are a pure, excellent and very noble poet, but one Also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I malfit.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people, who always seems the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters At eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Evidently, they are the two 'Bigger Than Life', but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my rank of hatter at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and Treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

The purpose of the partnership is to incorporate the chatgpt language model in Kakao, they announced the two companies after a Seoul meeting between Kakao executive director Chung Shin-A, and OpenAi official Sam Altman. "I am pleased to share our partnership with OpenAi as part of our ambition to reach new innovation and a leap in front through AI in 2025," Chung Shin-A told press.
According to explained, the two companies will work together to apply the technology of the US company to Kakao services and also develop AI joint products, while the South Korean company plans to launch the new AI Integrated brand, Kanana, until end of 2025.
"ChatgPT technologies will be integrated into our services, including Kanana, and the partnership includes technology sharing and the joint development of AI products for Kakao's 50 million users," Chung added.
Kakao is South Korea's main information technology company and operates the largest application of mobile conversation, Kakaotalk, with over 50 million users, a number that almost equals the country's population.
The announcement of OpenAi and Kakao comes weeks after the launch of DeepSeek, the latest Chinese AI development alternative, which is at the top of the free transfers tables from the App Store mobile application store, both in China and the US, surpassing the chatgpt itself.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 01:37:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Nissan Motor | Court confirms a conviction of former director</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/nissan-motor-tribunal-confirma-condenacao-de-ex-director/</link><description>American Greg Kelly, former director of Nissan Motor, was yesterday again convicted in Japan for collaborating on the financial irregularities committed by former President Carlos Ghosn, run away from Japanese justice.
The Supreme Court of Tokyo upheld the decision made in March 2022 by another court in the capital, which was the subject of appeal by the defendant, after receiving a suspended sentence of six months in prison.
Kelly, once Ghosn's right arm, was considered guilty of conspiring with the former president of the company not to declare future compensation agreed between Nissan and the maximum leader of the automobile manufacturer.
The suspended imprisonment meant that Kelly had not to serve a prison sentence as long as she was not involved in any criminal activity over three years, and in practice allowed her to return to the United States.
Kelly alleged in the appeal the acquittal of all accusations that he was considered guilty. The prosecution requested up to two years in prison for the US executive, detained in Japan in November 2018, at the same time as Ghosn's detention.
The American jurist worked at Nissan as a representative director, one of the highest positions at the top of the company, and turned out to be the only Nissan executive to be tried after other Japanese officials have reached court agreements.
The sentence of 2022, confirmed yesterday, was the first in the 2018 process against Ghosn, which shook the automotive industry, because it is one of the most respected executives among the largest car manufacturers in the world.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 01:35:08</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Trump creates sovereign background that can buy Tiktok</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/eua-trump-cria-fundo-soberano-que-pode-vir-a-comprar-a-tiktok/</link><description>Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday that determines that the Treasury and Commerce departments create a “sovereign background,” stating that it may acquire the Tiktok social network.
“I believe Scott and I will create an amazing sovereign background. Other much smaller countries already have them and are not the US. We have incredible potential in this country, ”he said, alluding to his nominee to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in statements made at the White House.
Speaking about this background, Trump advanced Tiktok's example, opening the door to his acquisition. “Let's do something. Maybe with Tiktok or maybe not. We can put it in the sovereign background, ”he said, adding that there are“ a lot of things ”that can be included in the background.
This platform continues to work in the US, thanks to the 75 -day extension signed by Trump on 21 January a day after being sworn in president. Trump's decree ordered the Attorney General and the Justice Department that they did not apply sanctions or a law of the previous president, Joe Biden, in the next 75 days.
Biden's law forced this video platform to separate from its Chinese 'holding', Bytedance, and finding a buyer of a country that was not considered "an adversary" before 19 January.

“I think it's a unfortunate decision, because, first of all, (…) it's an economic initiative. The aim is to build a platform for countries, especially from the global south, to have economic cooperation with each other. It is not related to any political agenda, ”said China's ambassador with the United Nations (UN), Fu Cong, at a press conference in New York.
According to the diplomat, the economic cooperation in question "is mutually beneficial," admitting to expect Panama to "see it rightly." "Any defamation campaign that is launched by the United States and some other Western countries" about the silk route initiative "is totally unfounded," he said.
At the same time, US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, considered on Monday that Panama took "a big step" by not renewing the commercial cooperation agreement with China about the Silk Route initiative.
“The announcement made yesterday [Sunday] by President José Raúl Mulino that Panama will let his participation in the initiative of the waist and the Route of the CCP [Communist Party of China] is a big step forward to relations between the US and Panama and for a free Panama channel, ”Rubio said on social network X.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 01:23:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing opens investigation against Google and imposes tariffs on US products</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/pequim-abre-investigacao-contra-google-e-impoe-tarifas-a-produtos-dos-eua/</link><description>China yesterday announced the opening of an investigation on Google and imposed new rates on a number of US products hours after President Donald Trump has applied a 10 percent rate to Chinese products.
China will investigate the US technological giant for alleged violation of Chinese antitrust laws, according to a state administration statement to regulating the country's market.
Beijing also announced the application of 15 percent rates on coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) and 10 percent over oil and agricultural equipment from the United States.
"The unilateral imposition of customs rights by the United States severely violates the rules of the World Trade Organization," the Chinese Ministry of Finance said in a statement announced the imposition of retaliatory tariffs.
"Not only is it useless to solve their own problems, but also undermines normal economic and commercial economic cooperation between China and the United States," the Chinese government added.
China's measurements were taken almost immediately after the application of US tariffs.
Washington's decision regarding China contrasts with the situations of Mexico and Canada, in which both nations obtained a postponement of 25 percent rates for a month after reaching separated agreements with Donald Trump.
Coins suffer
Last Saturday, Trump appealed through an executive order to the Communist Party of China to prevent criminal organizations from facilitating the flow of illicit drugs into the United States.
The reopening of the trade war between the United States and China reverberated in the performance of the Chinese currency in the offshore markets, where Yuan fell 0.3 percent to $ 7,3340 following the announcement of retaliation. Yuan negotiations in the 'ONShore' market are closed due to the Lunar New Year holiday.
If the US dollar has recovered from the Chinese currency, while the Australian and New Zealand coins, which have strong commercial calls with China, fell almost 1 percent. Other Asian currencies, such as Thai Baht and Indonesia Rupia, reduced gains.
Google search and internet services for consumers have been unavailable in China since 2010, although the company has maintained operations in the country, especially around its advertising business. The United States provided about 6 percent of China's LNG imports last year, according to ships location data.
Over the weekend, the US Administration leader ordered the application of a general rate on Chinese imports, which came into force from midnight yesterday in the United States, due to what Trump justified as Beijing's failure. in preventing the flow of illegal drugs.
The executive orders of the new White House tenant included retaliation clauses that would increase customs rights if countries responded in the same way.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 01:20:16</pubDate></item><item><title>UN | China chairs in February to the Security Council</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/onu-china-preside-em-fevereiro-ao-conselho-de-seguranca/</link><description>The Chinese presidency has already given indications that it intends to promote multilateralism and improve global governance by appealing to the constructive participation of all parties
 
China, which presides over the United Nations Security Council this month, will organize a ministerial level meeting aimed at “reforming and improving global cooperation”, a meeting that will be attended by Chinese (foreign business minister).
China's permanent representative with the United Nations (UN), Fu Cong, presented his schedule to February on Monday, and indicated that the MNE of China, Wang Yi, will preside over 18 February an open debate Under the theme "practice multilateralism, reform and improve global governance."
The invitation to participate in the debate was made to foreign ministers or high employees from other countries, including states that do not integrate the UN Security Council, Wang Yi said.
According to the Chinese diplomat, this will be a "good opportunity" for US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to meet the Chinese counterpart if he accepts the invitation to move to New York to attend the meeting of the Council Security.
“By noting this year the 80th anniversary of the UN foundation and as the world enters a very turbulent period, this open debate aims to encourage countries to revisit UN's original aspirations, reaffirm their commitment to multilateralism and Importance of the role of the United Nations, including the Security Council, and explore ways to reform and improve global governance, ”explained Beijing's representative.
"The aim is to build a fairer and more equitable global governance system that addresses the global governance deficit and ensures that its benefits are shared by all," he added.
According to Fu Cong, solidarity and cooperation are being replaced by the division and confrontation, admitting that "the council often managed to do anything in the face of great security crises."
Separate differences
Asked whether the deterioration of relations between Beijing and Washington may affect the work of the Security Council -the organ of which the United States and China are permanent members -the Chinese diplomat said he expects to be able to cooperate with his US homologous, Elise Stefanik, despite the “wrong prejudices and ideas” that has expressed publicly about Beijing.
“Overall, I believe China and the US (…) have a lot in common and we can cooperate. For example, within the UN structure there are global issues that require joint efforts from the entire international community and, in particular, from countries such as China and the United States, such as the fight against terrorism, drugs, or non-village. And also, in my opinion, the issue of climate change must be an issue where the two countries can cooperate with each other, ”he said.
"I hope that, despite all the rhetoric we hear from American politicians, we can adopt a constructive and underlined approach, professional in our work here on the UN," he said. During the Chinese presidency of the Security Council, the situation in the Middle East will continue to focus, being already scheduled 'briefings' about the Palestinian issue, but also on Syria and Yemen.
“Regarding Gaza, there is now a ceasefire, but the situation remains fragile. The board needs to closely monitor the events and take action, if necessary, to ensure that the ceasefire agreement is fully and effectively implemented, and that humanitarian access remains open and unimpeded, ”explained Fu Cong.
“It is evident that the situation in West Bank also deserves our attention. Just yesterday [Sunday], we heard reports of military attacks from Israel's defense forces against residential blocks in the fields of Jenin and Tulkarem, ”he said.
In this sense, the Chinese ambassador met on Monday morning with UN Palestinian Mission representative Riyad Mansour, who in turn asked the Security Council to adopt quick measures to end the situation and call a meeting to address these attacks.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 01:17:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Russia | UN denounces increased prisoners' executions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/04/russia-onu-denuncia-aumento-de-execucoes-de-prisioneiros/</link><description>The UN has denounced and condemned yesterday the increase in the number of Ukrainian soldiers' executions held in captivity by the Russian forces in recent months, echoing Kiev's accusations.

“Many Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered or were in the physical custody of the Russian Armed Forces were shot dead in the scene. Witnesses also described the murder of unarmed and injured Ukrainian soldiers, ”said the UN.
The UN Human Rights Observation Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said it had “registered 79 such executions in 24 separate incidents” since late August.

The documentary, by Ricardo Clara Couto was funded by RTP2 and aired at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center
How did you come across this character in Portuguese history in the East?
My brother, named Filipe Pires, traveled for Vietnam for a while and when he arrived from the trip he told me that he had to know the incredible history of the Jesuit Francis of Pina who had made the romanization of the Vietnamese alphabet, providing freedom and cultural independence tremendous. I was a little skeptical at first, because I found it strange no one to know this in Portugal, but I started my research on the subject and discovered a university study of a Franco-Vietnamese teacher who teaches in Madeira. I then confirmed that the idea that my brother had brought from Vietname was correct. From there, I tried to discover the origin of this priest, the work he had done, and realize why there was so little knowledge about Francisco de Pina in Portugal.
In addition to being a Jesuit missionary, can you highlight some biographical points that help you understand your legacy?
In the documentary I did not have the time to be able to take a more exhaustive biographical approach. I focused on the part where he arrives at Vietname. We talk about a man with an incredible culture and a desire to acculturate and be acculturated. A man who was a musician and was easier, thus learning the Vietnamese, which is a six -tone language. Deep down, despite being a Jesuit priest, he had the first of course culture and not so much religion. This, for me, is a reason for huge admiration. For him the essential objective of evangelization was secondary, because, for him, if we could not understand the culture of Vietname, we could not teach the Vietnamese people. It was more important to deepen local culture and language, making it possible to be able to explore the most religious part. It was also a man who had a hard time when he arrived at Vietname.
Why?
There were some internal wars before some local gentlemen of the regions who did not agree with the mission of the priests. This is not explored in the documentary, but in fact Francisco de Pina even made some steps [for the Jesuit mission], as the priests were not totally accepted everywhere. He eventually took refuge in a Japanese neighborhood and, from there, built his base.
Francisco de Pina, like what happened to many Jesuits at the time, was training in Macau, at the College of S. Paulo. How was it influenced by this period spent in the territory?
There is not much information about this time. It is known that it was indeed formed in this college, as was the case with many Jesuit priests at the time, but then went to Japan. Only then go to Vietname. So far, there was nothing of great relief in the life of Francisco de Pina, who followed the normal way. Japan was already expelling the Jesuit priests and it is in this context that goes to Vietname. The only most prominent thing about this period is that the 14 ships that left Portugal to arrive in Macau this year remained only three, and the ship where I was Pina Francisco was one of those who survived the storm.
Do you consider that your great legacy was the romanization of Vietnamese? What are the great contributions of this process in linguistic terms?
It is a giant contribution. If we think that even in the romanization of the language, Vietname was very dependent on the Chinese alphabet, and could not have cultural, linguistic and economic independence as well. After the romanization of the alphabet it was possible for Vietname to grow in these domains and have her own identity. The country has grown a lot to this day, because without writing a tongue passes only to the new generations of mouth in mouth, and the legacy of Francisco de Pina also remains today. The Vietnamese people are very grateful to this, and the proof is that two years ago a delegation of the Vietnammemesse Language Foundation Foundation came to Portugal and offered a monument to Guarda City Council (see Caixa) in honor of Francisco de Pina. However, I was surprised by the fact that the Vietnamese, and we talked about full -sided academics, know the story, the figure of Francisco de Pina, existing in the country several references. But in Portugal it is a little known figure.
How do you explain this?
I think this will have to do with the need Portugal has to make its catharsis about this period of history. Portugal was a completely different country from Africa to the East, and completely different from Africa to the Americas. But, however, there is this weight of guilt. Portugal cannot talk about this period of time, despite having a rich history between Africa and the East, but this time is not very approached because the country has not taken over what happened and, therefore, cannot talk about this period. Therefore, so much of the rich history of Portugal is unknown to the Portuguese.
How was the research process for the documentary?
I quickly arrived at the study of Professor Minh Ha Nguyen Lo Cicero of the University of Madeira, and with her we went to the roots of the Vietnamese language. When I discovered it was amazing, because it is part of the Vietnamese alphabet romanization triangle, as it is Franco-Vietnamese. Until recently, the official version that existed was that Alexandre de Rhodes, French Jesuit, had romanized the alphabet, later registering it in the Vatican and saying that it was a work in honor of his master, Francisco de Pina. However, the name of Francisco de Pina disappeared. From here we passed to the nationalist French official narrative that the romanization of the alphabet had been made by French because Vietname was a French colony. Then I also arrived at Professor António Morgado. The remaining contacts were made at Vietname, linguists, university professors and language specialists, especially in writing, who later joined the documentary.
How would you describe the Vietname of the time of Francisco de Pina?
It was very fragmented. They have a very their own culture that existed through a writing with Chinese hieroglyphics, but deals with Vietnamese, which led only 1 to 3 percent of the population to read and write. With the romanization this percentage increased exponentially, and with this the culture developed with the populations, united them more around common writing. I think this has made Vietname more modern and prepared to integrate into the rest of the world by having a more affordable language.
Do you feel it will help unravel this part of the history of Portugal, as well as the history of the Jesuit mission itself?
I hope so. Portugal seems to have a certain fear and shame to talk about this time, and proof of this is that this Vietnamese people came to Guard to offer a monument and practically did not come out of the subject. In addition, the representatives of the Vietname delegation were a little admired for not being received at an official level, except for the mayor of Guarda. I, who was invited by them to be present, felt a little shame of others, because Vietname came to Portugal to offer a monument and this is viewed as a secondary event, which is not. It would be important to make known this priest and this made to the country and the world, because Portugal and Vietnam have a very close and rich cultural history, as with Japan and China. But this is a little known aspect of the Portuguese people and [this documentary] can be a good opportunity for the country to make their catharsis.
Vietnamese artist sculpture resembles Francisco de Pina at Guarda
In November 2023, the Vietnamese Language Foundation offered the city of Guarda the sculpture “Nova Estela” by Vietnamese artist Nguyen Huy Anh. The work can be seen in the Garden of the Eduardo Lourenço Municipal Library. According to news from the agency Ecclesia, the event took place under the celebrations of the 824th anniversary of the attribution of Foral by King D. Sancho I to the city. “This is a posthumous tribute to Father Francisco de Pina, a Guarda-born Jesuit priest in 1586, whose religious path underwent a mission in Vietname, where he lived nine years of intense missionary activity, linguistics and of interculturality, ”said the Diocese of the Guard, in a statement.
According to the same note, the missionary Francisco de Pina was responsible for the introduction of the Latin alphabet and diacritical signs in the transcription of the sounds and tones of the Vietnamese language, which used, in writing, Chinese characters.
The priest embarked for over 400 years at the Nau de Nossa Senhora do Mount of Carmo, having completed the training at the São Paulo College in Macau and received the priestly ordination in Malaca. It was then called to the newly created Mission of the Jesuit Cchinchina, a zone that corresponds to the central part of the current Vietname. “He never came to the city where he was born and now returned in a bronze -carved boat by Vietnamese artists brought by the distant Vietname sea. From now on, Father Francisco de Pina will be in the historical memory of the guard and its inhabitants, materialized in this boat that brought him back to his city, leaving the name of the guard far, also written in Bronze letters ” , concluded the diocese.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 00:46:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Francisco Leandro, author and professor at the University of Macao: “Support from the country reinforces the role of Macao platform”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/16/francisco-leandro-autor-e-professor-na-universidade-de-macau-apoio-do-pais-reforca-o-papel-de-plataforma-de-macau/</link><description>Gang Wen interview with China Daily newspaper
Francisco Leandro, an associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Macao, states that the nation's support has allowed the MSA to serve as the Center for Commerce, Investment and Cultural Interactions between China and Portuguese Language Communities.
 
 
How do you see Macau's development since your return to the homeland? Among the city's achievements, which ones impressed him most? What about its sector, has there been an important progress in the last 25 years?
The 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the homeland and the creation of the Special Administrative Region of Macao is a significant milestone in the history of the region, reflecting a successful diplomatic process and demonstrating its current political and economic stability. Currently, RAE de Macao enjoys political stability and is deeply integrated into national development plans. The governance of the city under the beginning of “a country, two systems” allowed him to maintain a high degree of autonomy, while aligning himself with national policies. This integration facilitated Macao's economic growth, making it a vital part of the country's broader economic strategy.
Macao's socioeconomic development strategy is consecrated in the policy “a center, a platform, a base”. This picture aims to position MSA as a world center of tourism and leisure, reinforcing its attraction as a global tourist destination. In addition, MSAR acts as a platform for economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, promoting international trade and cultural exchange. Rae de Macao is also becoming a base of exchange and cultural cooperation, promoting cultural interactions and the conservation of heritage. This multifaceted approach supports Macao's integration into national development plans and reinforces its global presence. The unique position of MSA as a bridge between China, in particular the great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay, and Portuguese-speaking countries underline their strategic importance.
The concept of “a platform, three centers” enhances Macao's role in promoting economic and cultural exchange. This platform allowed the city to serve as a platform for trade, investment and cultural interactions, reinforcing the ties between China and the Lusophone world.
Macau's development as a tourism and leisure center, along with the promotion of four main industries - conventions and exhibitions, cultural and creative industries, traditional Chinese medicine and modern financial services - diversified its economy. These initiatives not only boosted economic activity, but also reinforced the global attraction of Macau as a tourist destination.
The central government adopted a series of policies for Macao. Is there any specific measure that has benefited your sector? As?
The interior of China and the Macao Economic Economic Partnership Agreement (Cepa) play a crucial role in the great bay and in the promotion of ties with Portuguese -speaking countries. By promoting commercial and economic cooperation, the strain reinforces the position of MSA as a bridge between China and Lusophone countries. This agreement facilitates access to the market, investment and cultural exchange, promoting Macao as an international business center. In addition, the strain supports the integration of Macau in the Great Bay area, contributing to regional development and economic diversification. This strategic role underlines the importance of Macau in the broader economic and diplomatic initiatives in the country.
The promotion of higher education in RAE de Macao also played a crucial role in its development. In investing in education and research, Macau contributed to the objectives of national development and was positioned as a center of academic excellence. This bet on education has allowed to create a skilled labor, essential to sustain economic growth and innovation. The University of Macao is highly considered in global academic rankings. It was classified in 180th place at the World University Rankings 2025 by Times Higher Education, and 245th at QS World University Rankings 2025. In addition, the University of Macao is ranked 262nd in the best global universities by US News &amp; World Report. These classifications reflect the university's commitment to excellence in teaching and research, particularly in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Engineering and Social Sciences. The university's strong international collaboration and innovative investigation contribute significantly to their estimated global position.
This year is the third anniversary of the creation of the Guangdong-Macau in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin. In your opinion, how should Macau continue to take advantage of the advantages of the zone to develop himself and the education sector?
Hengqin's cooperation zone is one of the main objectives of Macao's modernization efforts. This zone has been fundamental to boosting innovation and economic diversification, providing a space for new industries and promoting a narrower integration with the continent. The area exemplifies Macau's commitment to modernization and its strategic role in regional development.
Macao is a unique mix of Chinese and Portuguese cultures. In your opinion, how can this merger help the nation to reinforce communication with the international community and tell the good stories of China?
Macao is a fascinating mix of cultures, where the East meets the West in a unique and harmonious way. His linguistic landscape is a testimony of his multicultural heritage. The Chinese is the official language and the Portuguese language can be used for official purposes, reflecting the historical ties of Macao with Portugal and its Chinese roots. English is also widely spoken, especially in business and tourism, which makes Macau a truly multilingual society.
The legal system of MSAR is another domain in which this cultural mixture is evident. Based on the Portuguese Civil Law System, it was adapted to the local context under the “one country, two systems” principle. This double legal system allows a unique mix of Chinese and Western legal traditions, ensuring that Macau's legal environment is familiar to its residents and accessible to international companies.
Macao's approach to the extrajudicial resolution of commercial conflicts further enhances its multicultural policy. The city offers various arbitration and mediation services that serve both local and international parts, promoting the efficient and friendly resolution of disputes. Macao's open city policy and multicultural attitude are the key to its success as a global center. The city welcomes people from around the world, promoting a diverse and inclusive community. This opening is reflected in its festivals, its gastronomy and their daily lives, where different cultures coexist and enrich each other. Essentially, the mix of language, legal systems and multicultural attitudes of Macau makes it a unique and dynamic place that establishes bridges between cultures and promotes global bonds.
What achievements would you like to see by Macau in the next 25 years?
In short, Macao's future is brilliant, with greater integration with mainland China, its central role in international trade, diversified economic growth and a strong global presence. These elements will ensure Macao's continuous success and development at the world scene. The 25th anniversary of Macao's return to the Fatherland celebrates not only a successful diplomatic achievement, but also the continuous contributions of the region to national and world development. Macao's strategic initiatives and their integration in national plans underline their importance as a dynamic region and facing the future.</description><pubDate>2024-12-16 02:20:12</pubDate></item><item><title>António Antunes, cartoonist: “Sometimes I consider myself an artist”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/12/antonio-antunes-cartoonista-as-vezes-considero-me-um-artista/</link><description>It's called Antonio Antunes, but signs her cartoons simply as Antonio. For 50 years it has characterized today using drawing and humor, most of them in the Express. In an interview, the cartoonist, who designed the days of the April 25, regrets that today young cartoonists do not have so many opportunities to sing in their career
This 50 -year adventure is already long dedicated to Cartoon. Have you ever thought you were going to do this for so many years?
No. Things were happening, and the result is this. There were not even perspectives to have a plan. Portugal has not been a country that greatly favors this type of activities.
He did training at António Arroio school during the Estado Novo period. What was it like to learn arts at a time when the country [Portugal] was so gray, with limits to creativity?
We mainly learned techniques, work or composition. Now creativity is something else. Not only was she very limited, but it's not something to sell either. There are no courses to take artists, there are courses that give us notions about painting composition or techniques, or colors. But that alone is not enough. Then there needs to be anything beyond what is academic. In the arts there is always anything that escapes even if you learn everything. Creativity is a strange thing because there is no rule.
Is Antonio considered an artist?
(Hesitates) Sometimes I consider.
He has had many controversial cartoons, namely Pope John Paul II with the condom in his nose. What were the cartoons that forced you to make the biggest waist play or deal with more pressures?
Maybe it's my happiness, but my problems are never a priori, but to posteriori. So far I have not been very limited in what I can do in the newspaper [Expresso]. Now, when things go out, sometimes have consequences. In Portugal it was the issue of condom in the Pope, internationally other things. This cartoon continues to move.
What was it like to deal with all this controversy?
This cartoon [Pope John Paul II] was controversial because they wanted to be so. That went very well and did not generate any ranks. Then there was a conservative movement within the church that wanted to make it a controversy, three weeks began to excite that, to make a petition. The man who led the Catholic forces said he expected a million signatures, but fortunately he got only 29,000, and the difference made the mountain not a mouse Parisse. It was even discussed at the Assembly [of the Republic]. It is a controversy a lot of little, even more, 30 years later, when the church itself is changing its point of view on this matter, namely with this Pope [Francis], fortunately. In the face of what led me to do this cartoon, I did it again. The Pope's statements at the time were public, they were not even hidden, inside walls, and spoke to the whole world, so also to me. I felt injured, that it made no sense. I think the Pope's attitude at that moment was criminal at the Pico da Aida and in Africa. It was of huge insensitivity and foolishness.
Is Cartoon a throwing weapon, a form of expression?
Throw of throwing is a hard expression of too much, but the cartoon is, in fact, the way I express myself. There are my colleagues who make articles, but I make drawings.
What other cartoons highlights, for what they brought you?
The first one that sensitized me was the one who made me win the world's largest salon in the world [major prize of the XX Salon International of Cartoon, Montreal, 1983], from this corner that is Portugal. A hall that had over a thousand participants, and gaining it was very good. I was safer, confident, because from then on they could continue to do things. This first cartoon also gave controversy, the “Warsaw Ghetto in Shatila”, in which I use the known photograph of the ghetto, a Jewish kid raised, harassed by Nazi soldiers, and in the cartoon the kid is Palestinian and Israeli soldiers. [The controversy was] with all the voices of the Jews, who are experts in this, making a lot of noise, with a certain tone of victimization, even if they are attacking. A hall director said he tried to change the vote, such is the weight of Jewish lobby, but failed.
This cartoon could be drawn today again.
I already published it again. Unfortunately it is not out of date.
But do you feel that much of what you designed about today is repeated, in a sign that the story is cyclical?
There is a resistance to change. One of the merits of the cartoonist is to be able to see ahead of time, or over time if you want. I have the invasion of Crimea made in 2014, and I assume that vision. It was above, and others did it later. There are other examples.
It begins to do cartoon after April 25, 1974, there a little there in the aftermath of the revolution. Do you feel that, in a way, has inaugurated the discipline of the Political Cartoon in Portugal?
Perhaps. But I'm not very clear about it, because before me there was a great designer, João Abel Manta, a fantastic chart, which had a huge difference from us, because we were kids and he already had a culture that allowed him that. But there is a less good side, because he did political propaganda. He was a man of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), and made this advertisement to where the revolution allowed it. Then when things stabilized, he went out and went to do other things. This does not remove the quality, but it is not my notion of Cartoon. I respond to the various stimuli of events otherwise. Cartoon allows me to express opinions, but be able to do so in different meanings of life, perspectives, without being a prisoner, as he became a prisoner of the PCP, was something that helped me a lot.
Did you ever feel any pressure from the newspapers where you collaborated?
(Hesitates). Some things, but they are not important. One thing I got, without much effort, was to make people think I have a bad shape, and it was better not to get me. It helped because they thought twice before talking to me. Once in Expresso, a type of sport commissioned me a cover, and began to give tips on how I should make the design. Until I asked you if I ever told you how to write news. This must have been in memory for many years, and must have reverberated this conversation in other people. I did not go to the Express, I was always in my corner and did not wear out with everyday life, with friendships and enmities.
Do you usually draw here, in the studio?
Here. But this [the image of bad shape] really helped me. And there is also the story of me having another profession. I often say that I really had two professions, because I was a cartoonist and graphic designer, and then I had my customers who were also of the Express, namely the tobacha. He was a friend of the commercial director, a comfortable type, who was staring to negotiate contracts with the newspaper in the name of A Tabaqueira. Therefore, I conveyed an effective image of power that actually did not have. If you add a type that has bad shape to a type that apparently has power, it is a boring (laughs).
When I ask you about the pressures, I think in the period right after April 25, 1974-1975, where everything was politicized. Were there bigger?
I managed to deal with it. During this period of the Prec (ongoing revolutionary process) it even had a cartoon over the need that lasted two years. It was a kind of escape forward. There was a great confusion, and I think it was interested in my newspaper [express], although that was never said. It gave an idea of ​​freshness of the newspaper about a complex period, but they never told me that. I have the idea of ​​this use of Cartoon, it was the way of consolidating the newspaper's independence regarding events, even when sometimes there was no such independence.
Are we today in a politically correct era, where everything seems to offend?
I don't feel, because I don't want to feel. I came to a phase of my life where if they didn't want to put up with me, they don't work. It's easy. Everything that was a struggle to impose a name and a point of view, a career, has already been made. It can be improved and consolidated, but if not, it is not. If I become very inconvenient for the newspaper where I work, and I want to believe this does not happen…
But in general terms, to the news, comments on social networks, do you feel that there is the politically correct?
Of course there is. My situation is of exception. The younger ones in the world of Cartoon have no opportunities at all. They have less than when I started. For various chances of life I have a position that has solidified, but this is not exemplary to what goes on. The new cartonists are full of trouble, there is no room for them, there is no means of payment. They are pushed to get out of the newspapers, not to enter.
Doesn't Cartoon have no place on social networks?
(Hesitates) It may appear, but it doesn't seem to me… Journalism is said to die and we cartoonists are going first. I think this is the trend. Journalism has been losing power in the face of social networks, with an anonymous opinion, which cannot be scrutinated, is very bad and mediocre. And that will grow.
What about Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Can replace the cartoonist.
This one I don't even speak because I do not know the limits, but I am intended to be terrible. It can indeed replace the cartoonist, but there is a subverting creativity.
Is there any public figure who particularly likes to portray in Cartoon?
The other day he said that, in relation to Trump, he had two antagonistic feelings: as a citizen, I find man detestable; But as a cartoonist is my raw material. Putin is also good. All men with many narratives and much power are likely to give good things from the point of view of analyzing a cartoonist. They are politicians with a very clear speech about what they want and what they want, and this can be good for Cartoon.
How do you feel to go to Macau again?
The exhibition [at the Military Club] will be different from the others, with 160 works. It's still a lot. It is a trip for these years, for Portuguese and international politics as well. I'm full of curiosity, promoting the show, seeing what they ask me, but this is part of the game.
The press of Macao does not have a great presence of Cartoon, except for Rodrigo [Rodrigo de Matos].
I know him, I get along with him. But I must say that the phenomenon is similar to Portugal. What do we have here? I, in the Express; Cristina Sampaio in the public; André Carrilho left the Diário de Notícias; António Maia in Correio da Manhã and little more. This is a general trend. Sometimes, and I think this happened to me, there are times when a cartoonist can represent a more value for the newspaper, but it's just a few moments when it can happen. In my most complicated period in Expresso, in the late 1970s, a reference newspaper that, at the time, was in a country in convulsion, with some “irresponsibility” I could go ahead, and I have the perception that I helped the newspaper to detangle of these limitations. But this happens in very specific periods. In this phase [after April 25], I even made drawings at night that were already out of date.
Do you really have a bad shape or is it just to disguise?
I am shy, but I've been treating myself. (laughs) It was never something that had blocked me, I speak well in public. I'm a type I don't like to take stupid risks. I have been in this building for several years and I know only the gate because it has to be, and I do not want to have the risk of having an antipatic person to whom I confident. I do this with the greatest naturalness.
Military Club Exhibition
After the lecture at the Rui Cunha Foundation, this Wednesday, António will be today at the University of São José to talk to students at the “Cartoon Drawing: Ideas” workshop. This Friday follows the inauguration of the exhibition at the Military Club, which will be evident until January 2.</description><pubDate>2024-12-12 00:58:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Ben Lee, a game analyst, about the new concessions: “We need something grand”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/03/ben-lee-analista-de-jogo-sobre-as-novas-concessoes-precisamos-de-algo-grandioso/</link><description>The game analyst and consultant Ben Lee believes that it is necessary to do much more to diversify the economy of Macau beyond the game, especially given the type of events organized under the new concessions. The analyst thinks that Macau could look at two resorts in Vietnam as examples to follow international tourists
 
What balance do you do the two years of new game concessions?
There is still a lot of work to do. From what we could see so far, dealers have focused on lighter projects, such as local art galleries, cultural events, concerts and small rehabilitation of cultural neighborhoods. Large projects, such as the high -tech amusement park, the conservatory or new hotels have not yet been seen. Since two of the ten years have passed [concession], and given that the construction of some of these projects should take several years, it seems that it will be necessary to add them. The non-game segment revenues, in a percentage of gross revenue obtained by the dealers, seem to be higher than 2019, but have diminished in the last two years. It is possible to return to the next two years to be between the 10.5 and 11 percent verified in 2019.
Recently, Ho Iat SENG thanked the concessionaires to comply with contracts and collaboration in the development of the non-game segment, reiterating that they were able to make some profits during the pandemic. Do you think it was fair in your words?
Casinos are making efforts to develop the non-game segment, but once again most of these efforts are focused on lower, lower-level events. We don't see great ideas like the $ 2.3 billion investment sphere we see in Las Vegas, for example. If that happened, it would easily fit the $ 15 billion commitments promised by the concessionaires [when signing the new contracts]. We could also talk about the idea of ​​making a Formula 1 competition on the street, as seen in Singapore and recently in Las Vegas.
How do you analyze the recovery of operators in terms of game revenue in recent months?
The recovery of the game in Macao has been extremely good, and the sector is expected to recover to about 78 or 79 percent of the levels recorded in 2019.
The Macao Games Society (SJM), for example, was one of the game operators with the greatest difficulty in terms of cash flow during the pandemic. Do you consider that your recovery, compared to the other five, was positive?
The SJM had difficulties at first, but it seems to be finally making some progress. But there will still be some challenges to reposition your hardware [facilities and other enterprises] in the future.
What can we expect from the new government of Sam Hou Fai for the game area?
The chief executive elected seems to be trying to ensure that operators honor their commitments. Your two terms will probably cover the next eight years of the new concessions. I think that, ultimately, everything will be known to know if he can motivate the various government appliances to perform his vision and mission.
In the context of new contracts, how do you see the global evolution of the game sector?
In 2019, the percentage of non-game segment revenues compared to the game's recipes reached 10.5 percent. This percentage rose to 22 percent during COVID-19, and has since gradually fallen to 13.5 percent, according to the third quarter of this year. This percentage will continue to decrease as game recipes continue to grow. In recent times we have seen residents of Macau and Hong Kong go to the north [China] to save money. The question that arises is why the inhabitants of the continent would go down and do the reverse? The solution, as provided by the authorities, is that Macau needs to diversify the market [of tourists and players] that comes from the continent. This makes perfect sense in terms of logic, but the reality is that our efforts seem to be regressing. Visitors from outside the Greater China represented 7.8 percent of the total visitors from Macao, but decreased to 6.5 percent by the end of September this year. This refers to the lightweight events that have been organized that, by far and largely, are really oriented to the Chinese who, after all, constitute most of our source of recipes.
How can you get around this scenario?
Returning to the beginning, I think we really need something large, iconic, similar to the sphere in Las Vegas or even something like the “Golden Bridge” project in Da Nang, worthy of appearing on Instagram, or “Bridge From the kiss ”, in Phu Quoc, both in Vietname. The fact that these projects were built by a local group linked to the hotel sector, without any connection to profits from the game, demonstrates long -term creativity and perspective in terms of planning.
Class struggle
Ben Lee warns of the mass market danger of “running away” from Macau
The conversation with Ben Lee comes in the context of a lecture that recently starred in the two years of new game concessions. Promoted by the France-Macau Chamber of Commerce, the session was named “Macau New Gaming Landscape: Two Years Into Concessions, What Now?”, Having Igamix Management &amp; Consulting, according to Asian Gaming Brief, according to the portal Gaming Brief (AgBrief), that the VIP game did not end completely, thus being the target of a new classification.
According to Agbrief, citing words by Ben Lee, "the mass game incorporated the same [players] level that was so openly criticized by the government," but that operators "are changing their focus to accommodating it."
The analyst highlighted the "recent focus on the transformation of older and older hotel rooms into luxury options, with all operators understanding the need to get quality rather than quantity."
However, he argued that “the focus on the luxury segment continues to create an impasse” because “Macau has long focused on increasing the number of visitors to increase revenues”, but the business model “goes against the need to increase expenses per person ”.
Ben Lee also warned that many tourists could, in fact, start choosing other more affordable destinations. The analyst argued that mass players "cannot be ignored" as they remain "the main engine" of the sector. "Exorbitant prices from hotel rooms can constitute a" dam "for the increase of visitors," as, as suggested, "gamblers can go to other vacation places, such as Thailand, if the price is not good." This Asian country “is growing and is expected to exceed Singapore in terms of gross revenues” at a time when Thai work in the new legislation on the game.
“They hope to pass your game law in May next year. Starting from the principle this happens three to five years to build an integrated resort or enterprise. They may be working considerably before the opening of Japan, ”said Ben Lee.
Still in relation to the game market in Asia, the analyst pointed out that Asian gamblers will focus on the future game markets of Thailand and Japan "while enjoying the current offers in Macau, Singapore and Philippines," wrote Agbrief.</description><pubDate>2024-12-03 00:08:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion expropriated from any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death , systematically carried out to this day (still in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the county).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Tennis | Nuno Borges will play in front of Alcaraz in the Australia Open</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/16/tenis-nuno-borges-vai-jogar-frente-a-alcaraz-no-open-da-australia/</link><description>Nuno Borges surpassed the nervousness to defeat Australian Jordan Thompson in three sets in the second round of Australia Open, and will now face 'Carlitos' Alcaraz without pressure, admitted the Portuguese tennis player to Lusa agency.
“I feel it was a good game on my part. Undoubtedly it was better than the first round, the sensations were there, ”he began by analyzing national number, in statements to Lusa, after moving to the third round of the first Grand Slam of the season.
The 27-year-old Maiato contradicted Wednesday the favoritism of the 'local' Jordan Thompson, 27th standard head, imposed on 6-3, 6-2 and 6-4 partials, in one hour and 47 minutes, in a John Cain Arena - the third most important court by Melbourne Park - crowded.
"It was very nervous, it was a big stadium, not every day [that happens], so I think within that I could make a very good game and I really am very happy for the result," he said.
Follow to Alcaraz
Semifinalist in Auckland at the start of the year, Borges has now extended his good moment, setting a meeting in the third round with Spanish Carlos Alcaraz, the third world player.
“Now, against 'Carlitos', there is not much to say. Everyone knows what he is capable of and everything he has done, [is] quite famous around the world, there is not much to highlight, ”he said about his opponent who, in Australia, seeks to become the younger Tennis player (21 years old) to complete the Grand Slam career.
In front of Spanish, the 33rd ATP ranking will try to do its best and "make it the most uncomfortable possible." "I will play without pressure, try not to put high expectations in my head to see if I can bring my best tennis," he concluded.

“I am very happy. It was a very positive meeting. I think, in general, I served very well, at least I managed to put the ball on the places where I wanted and have a good percentage (69%). I felt that I kept quite constant except in the tie-break of the first set, which I didn't play very well. I always kept looking for and very consistent during a meeting and this turned out to be the key to the result, ”he said in statements to Lusa.
The world's national and 33rd number one needed two hours and 55 minutes to get the best of the Gaul opponent, recently champion of the Hong Kong ATP 250, in four sets, by the 6-7 (2-7) partials (2-7) , 6-3, 6-2 and 7-5, but believes it has deserved the triumph, in the return to Melbourne, where a year ago became in the first Portuguese tennis player to reach the round of 16.
“I feel like I deserved to win in four sets, I was slightly higher from the first set and I'm very happy. The first rounds are never easy in terms of sensations. Tennis does not flow the same way, is trying to gain pace, but fortunately meetings at the best of five sets give more time to find this pace. I feel that I ended up the meeting quite well, although exhausting too, ”he explained.
After the inaugural round victory, Nuno Borges will “take the opportunity to rest and recover tomorrow to play possibly Wednesday” with a home player, Jordan Thompson (27th ATP), who today surpassed at Margaret Court Arena O 'Qualifier' German Dominik Koepfer also in four partials, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, 4-6 and 6-3.
“I hope it's a good opportunity to play at a stadium possibly, I'm looking forward to it. We have played a long time ago [Estoril Open of 2021]. In 2024, he made a great season, quite impressive and I know that he, here in Australia, competes very well, always available to play five sets. I know I'll have to play my best tennis and I'm waiting for another big challenge, maybe even more challenging than today, ”said Borges, winner of the only duel with Thompson.</description><pubDate>2025-01-14 16:15:44</pubDate></item><item><title>GT Cup | Great Bay Race gains impulse from the interior</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/taca-gt-corrida-da-grande-baia-ganha-impulso-do-interior/</link><description>The GT Cup-Great Bay Race will join this year, the newly created Sro GT Cup, the latest GT competition launched in the interior of China, inspired by the GT4 class vehicles of the Macau Grand Prix
 
On the eve of last Christmas, Sro Motorsport Group, the entity responsible for organizing numerous races and championships, including the GT World Challenge Asia and, as the official partner of the FIA, the co-coordination of the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau , announced the creation of a competition for GT4 vehicles, consisting of four events in China. At the time of the announcement, only the inaugural event in Shanghai and the end in Beijing had been confirmed as part of the calendar.
Almost 30 cars, representing an impressive total of ten automotive builders, participated in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race of 2024, a race that has become an important milestone over the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix in recent years. Indeed, no other GT4 event in Asia brings together such quantity and diversity of cars. The Balance of Performance (BOP), responsible for balancing the performance of the various participating cars, was, at the time, managed by SRO.
In a statement, Benjamin Franassovici, managing director of Sro Motorsports Asia, said:
“We are enchanted, proud and privileged for adding the GT Cup - Great Bay Race to the inaugural calendar of Sro GT Cup, which begins and ends with the two largest motorized sports events in China. We already have a strong working relationship with the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, which has become the most significant race for GT4 cars in Asia. Its inclusion in the 2025 calendar of the SRO underlines the size of our ambition for this new national series. ”
High interest
The SRO GT Cup debut season starts in March at China's Formula 1 Grand Prix in Shanghai, before moving to the Zhuhai International Circuit - a place previously visited by SRO in BPR times and the FIA ​​GT Championship - where two 30 minutes races are planned. This is followed by the new Citadine Circuit of Beijing, which will host the GT World Challenge Asia on the same weekend, before the big end of the Sro GT Cup season, scheduled for a month later at the Guide Circuit in Macao.
The enthusiasm surrounding this competition is evident. As Benjamin Franassovici said, “This is reflected in the number of consultations and registration for the full season we have received since the release of the championship, just before Christmas. The demand has exceeded our expectations. ”
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the season end event on the streets of Macau, with places to be assigned based on the classification after the second round of the championship, which is scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit. All pilots with “bronze” or “silver” classifications attributed by the FIA ​​are eligible to compete in this competition, as long as they use approved cars from the GT4 class.
To attract brands, the results of SRO GT Cup races will tell the SRO GT4 builders ranking, a title attributed to the brand with better performance in the GT4 category at the end of each season. SRO GT CUP joins its Asian equivalent, Japan Cup, in a list that also includes continental and national competitions in Europe, America and Australia.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 11:13:41</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Rui Valente is not due</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/automobilismo-rui-valente-nao-se-da-por-vencido/</link><description>Rui Valente will return this year for another season in motorsport in the region. The Macao driver has been in the active for the same time and will play the Macau Roadsport Challenge, the tourist car competition organized by the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), as well as the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix , in November
 
With the same enthusiasm recognized for decades, Rui Valente will again drive, in the 2025 season, a Subaru BRZ, the same car with which he competed in the Guide Circuit last November in the Macao Roadsport Challenge race. In the event held at the event of the territory, the Portuguese pilot finished sixth place, after losing some positions in the start, where he descended to tenth. The result was not even better because the rain -played race ended prematurely due to an opponent's accident.
In the competition for local pilots, which currently combines starting grids with more than half a hundred cars, all of them Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8), Rui Valente admitted to HM that “not being overcome”, also revealing who is “missing the podium, both in China and Macau…”.
Premium Racing Team driver had, in the last Macao Grand Prix, one of the fastest in terms of tip speed in the platoon of his race. Therefore, the bet for this year will be in other technical aspects of the car that go beyond the engine.
"At this time, I just wanted to increase the diameter of the front wheels and widen the gauge to improve the car's behavior," he confided to HM, also reporting that he intends to "optimize weight transmission during the curve and its. exit". These improvements, along with lock system updates, should increase the competitiveness of the Japanese machine in a fierce grid, consisting of Macau, Hong Kong pilots and China interior, with constantly evolving cars.
Undefined calendar
The AAMC -organized car competition calendar has not yet been revealed. In 2024, Macao Roadsport Challenge debuted at the Zhuzhou International Circuit in East of Hunan Province, but Rui Valente would rather the competition returned to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC) in Zhaoqing.
“I was very fond of returning to Gic, because I have everything there,” says the Portuguese pilot, defender of the track located in the neighboring province. “When you go to a qualification test, for those who make four races and then Macau, if you are on a track you already know, such as GIC, where you are seven or more years, each time you get on the track and try to do better than which last means you are improving and improving your driving. So you know you soon that you are stronger that year to Macau. ”
On the other hand, for the experienced pilot of the territory, “if you go to a new track, like the Zhuzhou circuit, besides floors there to learn the new layout and improve your time, you will never know if you are really stronger For Macao, as you know when you run in the gic. ”
Like what happened in past seasons, the Macau Roadsport Challenge calendar is expected to be composed of two weekends, with two races each, which also serve as an investigation for the Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:47:48</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Luca Engstler still recovers from the accident</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/12/gp-macau-luca-engstler-ainda-recupera-do-acidente/</link><description>Although every year the Macau Grand Prix Organizing Committee puts a lot of resources and a lot of energy in the driver's safety, the Guide Circuit Continates, and will continue to be one of the most dangerous and risky in the world. This year, the young German Luca Engstler, who first participated in a GT3 car, felt the old maxim of this circuit in the skin: “The mistakes pay dearly”
 
After eight weeks after the most severe accident of his career, the 24 -year -old is still recovering from the apparent misfortune at the Cup of GT World Cup of the 71st Macao Grand Prix. On Friday afternoon, with the chronometer counting and when trying to improve his brand, Luca Engstler lost control of his Lamborghini Huracán GT3 Evo in the dreaded Mandarin curve, beating over 230 km/h in protective barriers. The car inscribed by the Liqui Moly Team Engstler, but prepared and placed by Grasser Racing Team, was completely destroyed and the German pilot even became unconscious after the impact.
“This is a unique event, Lamborghini's progress was not very good and to be ahead we had to risk more than the others. Basically, I was completely thoroughly and was unsuccessful, ”said Luca Engstler, at the time, the accident she suffered. Two months after what was “the most horrible day of my life to this day,” former German Touring Champion (TCR) is still in the recovery process.
“It was really a big impact,” said Luca Engstler, in conversation with the specialized portal motorsport-total.com, who needed a wheelchair after the accident. “The big problem was that my right ankle suffered a lot. I tore the lateral ligaments and had a lot of hemorrhages in tibia and fibula, which caused some concern, ”he recalled.
Returning to walk normally was also a big challenge for the young Lamborghini pilot, who in the 2024 season impressively won two DTM races and first participated in a GT3 car in Macao. "It took me a long time to be able to walk," he recalled. “In the first two or three days, I was really a wheelchair, because I just couldn't do anything and all the bones hurt me,” Engstler described to the publication of his country, saying that “he had bruises everywhere and everything was difficult ”.
Recover
Still, Lucas Engstler, at the end of the day of the accident, already at the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center, made a publication on social networks to say that everything was fine. The pilot, who was in Macao accompanied by his father, Franz Engstler - also a pilot and a well -known figure of Asian motorsport - wanted to reassure the closest. Two days after the accident, appeared on the GT da Fia World Cup starting grid on Sunday, without crutches, only slightly supported by an umbrella.
"What was important to me was not wanting to make a big sink about it," he explained to the Germanic portal. "In the end, the accident seemed very serious, but that only shows how safe the cars are," he said.
The pilot continues to recover from the sequelae of the strong impact. He took advantage of the winter break to take a trip from Autocaravana to Sweden with his best friend. "Everything is going well," he said, clarifying that he can run. "I would say I'm 95 percent and I have no permanent damage."
After the accident, the German worked on their recovery in the Allgäu region, in their homeland, “with some acquaintances, who are physiotherapists and doctors. I received excellent assistance. ”
Return
Luca Engstler admits that she has become impatient during the recovery process. "I was told that I could only do sports again in early February, but of course this could not accept," recognizing that he started training earlier than recommended.
Fortunately to Luca Engstler, DTM only starts on the last weekend of April. In the coming times, the pilot plans to sit back behind the wheel, possibly in a rental kart to start. The aim is to be in shape for the beginning of the preseason and the preparation tests of the popular German championship, scheduled for mid-February and early March.
As for the Macao Grand Prix, two days after the accident, Luca Engstler was quite clear: “I told everyone that my goal is to return and try to fight for victory in this great race.”</description><pubDate>2025-01-12 23:43:24</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Maro Engel clarified GT World Cup episode</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/10/gp-macau-maro-engel-esclareceu-episodio-da-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>Maro Engel won, in an inappropriate race for heart, the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macao's 71st Grand Prix. However, German's fourth victory among us was anything but peaceful. Maro Engel took advantage of an interview with the German magazine Motorsport Aktuell to explain what happened on the streets of the territory and earned him so many criticism
 
The Germanic pilot, who will turn 40 this year, had a 2024 season full of hits: he won the GT World Challenge Europe, was the best of Mercedes-AMG representatives in the TMD and won a fourth triumph in the Grand Prix of Macao. However, Maro Engel prefers not to highlight a single feat in his 2024 dream season, having referred to his country's expert magazine that “in terms of prestige, the victory in Macao has to be highlighted. But honestly, I don't want to highlight a single moment like the great achievement of this amazing year. I worked hard to reach all these successes. ”
In the since, the triumph of the Bavarian pilot was offered on a tray when the first two ranked ranks, Antonio Foco (Ferrari) and Raffaele Marciello (BMW), fell out in the lock for the Lisbon curve two turns from the end. However, Maro Engel had already been involved in another incident, when, at the beginning of the race, his loneliness, his Mercedes-AMG GT3 gave a subtle touch to the rear of the Vanthoor dries BMW, which followed in front of him in the third position. The young Belgian was projected against the barriers, eventually abandoning due to damage to the suspension of the M4 GT3, while Maro Engel would see the flag axad said first, with an advantage of 11 seconds.
Already at the end of the race, the Sports Commissioner College decided that the touch of the aforementioned tap deserved a 5 -second penalty, which had no impact on the final result, leading BMW Motorsport, Andreas Roos to tell the press that the incident “ It was not adequately penalized. ” Dries Vanthoor, who was also a candidate for victory, went further and said at the time that when “pushing another car out of track, he should not be able to win the race.”

It was not on purpose
Maro Engel's aggressive style was criticized at the time, but the pilot, who debuted to win in Macau in 2014, prefers to point out that “does everything within the boundaries of Fair Play” and thinks it is “hard to accuse a pilot not to try everything to win there (in Macau). ” In the situation in question, Maro Engel wanted to clarify that “I was clearly faster. At the wide part of the circuit at the bottom, I had no chance of attacking, so I tried at the top. It ended up running badly, and that was not my intention. I apologized to the dries later. In general, I run to win. The day you no longer give it all for that, I hang my helmet. I definitely not here to make new friends. ”
Despite the “chair dance” among the car builders involved in the GT3 class in this preseason, Maro Engel will continue to defend the colors of Mercedes-AMG, something that has been doing since 2008, and of course will be one of the stupid brand choices to The World Cup in November, at the Guide Circuit. The natural pilot of Munich is not being removed from the tracks anytime soon, because “I have not reached my peak yet and I still find pleasure in the races.”
In his curriculum, in events held in Macau, Maro Engel has two wins in the GT Macau Cup - FIA GT World Cup (2015 and 2024) and two others in the GT Macau Cup (2014 and 2022), but promises not to stay here.</description><pubDate>2025-01-10 06:21:42</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
