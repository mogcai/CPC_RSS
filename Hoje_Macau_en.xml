Harmonious images
Maria João Pereira confesses that she was doing a "continuous discovery." "There is no [in this exhibition], an image that has been created before what happened [pandemic].

The artist leaves the message that the images that the public will see are not full -naked, much less “provocative or vulgar”.

But these are harmonious images, and even those in which I have clothes, I wanted to find diagonals in space and body, so it is not just a naked body," added the artist, confessing that before "My Body" did not like to be photographed.
“I undoubtedly created a new mindset about my body. I didn't photograph and hated it, until I found out that I liked to do it.

The three leaders of the companies that will have allegedly bribed to the manager declared themselves innocent in court.
Don Don Donki at Fai Chi Kei opened September 2021 in the middle of pandemic. With strong border restrictions, the opening of the Japanese supermarket was viewed by the population as an opportunity to travel without leaving Macao. For wide weeks, the imposition of multitudes prevention and control measures was not enough to originate long lines of customers to enter the opened store 24 hours a day. In February last year, the brand opened a second store in Macau at Studio City.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 00:54:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Alberto Wong complains about defamation campaign</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/eleicoes-alberto-wong-queixa-se-de-campanha-de-difamacao/</link><description>The social worker also states that he has filed a complaint with the Judicial Police, after starting to circulate online comments that connect him to investments with investments in Myanmar and the debts left to pay

In a publication on social networks, the social worker also revealed that he filed a complaint to the Judicial Police (PJ).
"The statements to circulate on social networks aimed at my person have been made with malice and are slanderous, so they severely violate my personal dignity. Therefore, there are suspicions that the perpetrators committed the crimes of defamation and injury," wrote Alberto Wong. "I already denounced the cases to the PJ and delivered with the complaint the materials published online. The criminal case has already been installed," he said.
According to Wong, the PJ will now start an investigation and follow the tracks left by the profiles that made the comments considered defamatory by the candidate.

The penalty provided for in the law punishes infractors with fines ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 patacas
 
Until yesterday, the Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) received a total of 13 complaints related to the execution of electoral propagate during a period of prohibition. The numbers were updated yesterday in a press conference by Caeal President Seng Ioi Man.
"We are on the 12th day of the illegal advertising period or prohibition of advertising. So far, we have received 13 complaints. And we have paid close attention to these cases," said Seng Ioi Man. "We will follow the complaints seriously and we will cooperate with the competent authorities to follow these cases. If there is in fact advertising, we will give due treatment," he added.
According to the electoral law, electoral propaganda prior to the start of the election campaign is punished with a fine ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 patacas, so it is not one of the offenses in which the law obliges the granting of imprisonment, regardless of the severity of the offense.
Seng Ioi Man also revealed that CAEAL's analysis of the candidate list did not find out any offense until yesterday had to be supplied. "At this stage, the work of verification of the applications are running in an orderly manner. We currently do not verify any procedural irregularity or the eligible candidates, so there is no need for any candidacy to supply aspects of the list," said the president of Caeal
However, the Electoral Commission is still waiting for the State Security Defense Commission to take advantage of candidates, assessing whether they are patriotic and faithful to MSAR. "Regarding candidates who advocate or not the basic law, who are faithful or not to the MSAR, it is up to the State Security Defense Committee to determine. If uncomfortable are verified, this commission issues a binding opinion," he said. "CAEAL, based on the opinion of this committee, will take by July 15 the decision to verify the candidates and disclose all the results," he said.
More voting places
Yesterday's conference also served for Caeal to announce that, for the first time, for the indirect suffrage, two voting assemblies will be installed. In these elections only the representatives of local associations vote and the first assembly will be in the traditional place, the Macao Polytechnic University Polydestive Pavilion. In this place they will be able to vote the associations of industrial, commercial and financial sectors, work sector and sectors of social and educational services. The second voting assembly will be located at the Kao Yip School School, and will receive the votes of the professional sector and the cultural and sports sectors.
Regarding direct suffrage the 35 voting assemblies of the previous year will be maintained. The polls will be open on September 14 from 09h to 21h.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 00:49:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Works | Revitalization of the pier 23-25 ​​and Patio of eternal happiness later this year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/obras-revitalizacao-dos-cais-23-25-e-patio-da-eterna-felicidade-ainda-este-ano/</link><description>There are six historical areas to revitalize with the support and investment of the six game operators, but the deputies question the absence of news about what is being done and the slowness of the projects. The government assured that between the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth will be released more data and completed revitalizations of old zones
 
The revitalization of the 23-25 ​​quay in the interior port area and the eternal happiness courtyard should be completed later this year, being interconnected with the projects designed and funded between the executive and the six game operators for six ancient Macao zones.
The warranty was given yesterday by the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP. "The revitalization of the six zones is a priority task for the government, because we have to rely on the investments of the dealers. We have done studies, made an arrangement of the resources and now we know what we have. We want, at the end of the third quarter, beginning of the four quarter, to be able to advance with more details."
More concretely, it was up to a representative of the Cultural Institute to confirm that the rehabilitation of the eternal happiness courtyard and pier 23-25 ​​is completed at the same time.
Tai Kin IP has ensured that the government “is not stopped” while analyzing and studies. “We have already given instructions [to dealers] for the work that can be adjusted. We ask dealers to do the analysis depending on the characteristics of the zones. We will complete the structures [this year], with remodeling and restoration works, and we are working.”
The secretary stressed that the type of consumption is also being analyzed in these six zones, according to the type of tourists, with "two categories of consumption, the traditional and new generations."
“I ask you to accelerate”
Despite the promises of more detail, the deputies mourned the lack of more detailed information. “The essentials is to publicize the projects, because the government has to conduct certain investments and guide the market. Can the government have time to do the studies, but will small and medium -sized businesses take this time on studies? Will stores that are in the six zones continue to explore the activity?” Asked Deputy Ron Lam.
According to the deputy, the ideas for the six zones should result in a “transparent and publicized project to the public”, because “the whole society [has to be heard] so that all projects can reflect the market panorama”.
Another critical voice was that of IP Sio Kai, who asked for a comprehensive revitalization. “Everyone expects changes in the community economy. Concessionaires are committed to the six zones, but have passed two and a half years [since the announcement of the projects]. Of course there has been transition work, but there are new conception plans and everything should be done at the same time. For example, there may be obstacles to the conception of plans, because we have the street of happiness very close to the courtyard of eternal happiness, and it can be revitalized the surrounding areas. Of the six zones?
It should be noted that the six zones concerned include Rua da Felicidade, Pier No. 23 and 25 of the Inner Port; the surrounding area of ​​Avenida Almeida Ribeiro and Rua de Cinco de Outubro; the bar area near the dock D. Carlos I; Lai Chi Vun's shipyards in Coloane, and the Zone of Fortaleza do Monte.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 00:38:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Red Sea | Germany accuses China of pointing out laser to the military plane</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/mar-vermelho-alemanha-acusa-china-de-apontar-laser-a-aviao-militar/</link><description>The German government yesterday accused China of having pointed to a laser to a German military plane on a mission in the Red Sea to protect maritime traffic against Huthis attacks, adding to the Chinese ambassador.

I have five more years in the face of age when I did these images, but that was not impeding to look the body in another way. It is a constant search," he said.
The artist leaves the message that the images that the public will see are not full -naked, much less “provocative or vulgar”. "When a person does this kind of work has to be prepared for the good and bad. But these are harmonious images, and even those in which I have clothes, I wanted to find diagonals in space and body, so it is not just a naked body," added the artist, confessing that before "My Body" did not like to be photographed.
“I undoubtedly created a new mindset about my body. I didn't photograph and hated it, until I found out that I liked to do it. It was a fantastic discovery that gave me a lot of imagination, being able to create lines and diagonal with the body. I created a new relationship with my body,” he said.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 00:59:52</pubDate></item><item><title>HK | Inaugurated first museum in Asia dedicated to Cristiano Ronaldo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/08/hk-inaugurado-primeiro-museu-na-asia-dedicado-a-cristiano-ronaldo/</link><description>The first museum in Asia dedicated to Cristiano Ronaldo was inaugurated this Monday in Hong Kong, in a space where it is possible to follow the career of Portuguese international footballer, from the origins, in Madeira, to the current stage, in Al-Nassr.
The museum displays the five editions of the Golden Ball awarded to Cristiano Ronaldo, in 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017, which precede the best world player of the year, as well as signed nightgowns and boots that were used by the 40 -year -old striker during the extensive career.
A replica of the house where he lived in childhood, in Madeira, illustrates the humble origins of the athlete, whose professional path can be accompanied through multimedia content relating to passages by Sporting, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus.
"It's not just a museum, but a cultural destination, which reflects Cristiano's mindset and his message of overcoming," said Tomás Froes, representative of the player's family office, during the museum's presentation press conference.</description><pubDate>2025-07-08 19:18:12</pubDate></item><item><title>DANS | Alert due to the typhoon that made two dead in Taiwan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/danas-alerta-devido-ao-tufao-que-fez-dois-mortos-em-taiwan/</link><description>Several provinces in eastern China were yesterday on alert due to the arrival of the typhoon Danas, now weakened for tropical storm, which left at least two dead and more than 600 injured in Taiwan.
According to the forecasts, Danas will pass through southern Zhejiang and then move through the neighboring provinces of Fujian and Jiangxi, throughout this Wednesday, gradually reducing their speed of the current 75 kilometers per hour (km/h) to 35 km/h.
In addition to the strong winds, the Chinese authorities warned that some of the zones where the typhoon will pass may receive rainfall of up to 350 millimeters. This may result, according to China's meteorological administration, in flooding in mountainous and urban areas or in small and medium rivers to extravate the beds.
Several cities on the southeastern coast of China have announced prevention measures for the arrival of Danas, with Fujian authorities to also suspend several ferry routes that connect the continent to several islands.
Similarly, in Shanghai (east), located just over 300 kilometers north of the point where Danas is expected to touch Terra, the local government warned citizens to the possibility of strong gusts of wind and sudden rainfall.
Danas hit Taiwan at dawn on Sunday with winds of over 220 km/h, causing damage mainly in the southern part of the island and causing more than 5,000 incidents of diverse severity throughout the territory, where about 700,000 homes felt cuts in the supply of electricity.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 01:06:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Lake comes out van | Repair works start Saturday</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/lago-sai-van-obras-de-reparacao-arrancam-sabado/</link><description>Starting next Saturday, the works of renewal and repair of the wooden floor of the Lake Square Van Square, next to the Tower of Macao, yesterday indicated the institute for municipal affairs (AMI) yesterday indicated yesterday.

A mode of representation that sought communication between the author's spirit and that of the invited observer to discern the purpose of creation through the exposure of the process.
A demanding discipline, recognized until centuries later by distinguished theoreticals such as Dong Qichang (1555-1635), which put the barrier from which this painting could be exercised very high: no less than in Wang Wei (701-61) mode, the recognized founder of literate painting: 'Only after someone is like Wang Wei can use the Wang Qia Pomo way'.
Examples from the brush of this creator are today hardly observable and the termination of it preserved, there is almost only the seductive echo of a name that refers the listener to the expression of the substance of the Spirit. However, there is another name that in the stories of painting is often associated with him, that of Gu Kuang (727-821), of whom the paintings today are also rare but from whom they have been stored poems that indicate an imponderable presence.
In a palace poem, it is noted the availability to feel the abundant but subtle torrent of beauty captured by the senses, like the one in the wind or in a sound: «In a tower of jade, halfway to the sky, a song blown to the flute begins,/ The wind delivers in the palace the harmonious sound of the Palreo and the laughter of the girls who dwell. Drinking in the clepsidra,/ the waters, redrillants as crystals, would say a curtain unfolded over the Rio do Autumn. » But the poet and painter, disillusioned with the intrigues that embarrassed his duties at the service of the palace, removes the public service and will use the name well daoist buweng, the "old reclusive".
Gu Kuang had obtained the Jinshi degree, which allowed him to be an imperial employee in 757, in the unstable time of Emperor Tang Suzong, whose reign (756-62) would be marked by the concern to calm the revolt of An Lushan who had spread as a forest fire. Revolt that had forced his father to abdicate, Emperor Xuanzong and the consequent condemnation of the death of his favorite concubine, a fact reported in Ba Juyi's plangent poem (722-846), corner of perpetual remorse.
Born in Yunyang (current Danyang, Jiangsu) after a life saddened by the death of a son, he moves with his family in 792 to the mountainous chain of Maoshan, south of Jurong, where he will receive the grace of a new son at the age of seventy. When he goes there, he writes a purpose: «Hidden in Maoshan; To make basic gold metals,/ to make the body light as a pity.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves - Assistant researcher and coordinator of the Educational Service of the Macao Scientific and Culture Center
They have been running ink rivers on the founding of Macao, as well as the foundation of Lisbon. The latter the academics consider it more prudent, after properly analyzed the etymologies, to be due to Phoenicians or Tartassi (Rocha, 2007), but that the legend is poetically reminiscent of Ulysses, from Luís Vaz Camões to Fernando Pessoa.  Thus it reads at the beginning of the eighth corner of Os Lusíadas, which the beginnings of Portugal find their mythical roots in Luso, son and companion of Bacchus, and those of Lisbon in Ulysses (Camões, 1997, VIII.5):
Ulisses is the one who makes the Santa Casa
To the goddess who gives her Facunda language;
That if there in Asia Trojan insigne abrasa,
Here in Europe Lisbon Imparty Funda.
Nothing more about the illustrious Lusitanians descended from gods, as well as their geographical spaces were founded by Greek heroes of unparalleled value such as Ulysses, whose ingenuity warrior and marear art exceeded. Hence, some centuries became Fernando Pessoa, in the second epic poem that the Portuguese value the most, the message refer to Ulysses pointing to their mythological dimension and the unavoidable reality it sustains, since “myth is nothing that is everything” (Pessoa, 1986, 24):
 Thus the legend
To come into reality
And fertilizing it takes place.
Below, life, half
Nothing, dies.
Myths and legends offer reality often the best it has, in its quality of projection reveal ideas and ideals, providing an important source where the unconscious manifests itself, but also the collective conscious of a people. Ulysses Warrior and Navigator is the patriarch found to the measure to found the capital of a country of indomitable warriors who faced powerful empires, such as Muslim, the Roman, and later the Spanish and who had to discover the sea path to India, beyond the Extrema Asia, without ever losing its Cavalheresque facet.
This would be masterfully praised in the corner VI of Os Lusíadas in the episode of the twelve of England, among which figured Magriço. They would know how to defend the honor of their ladies to the sword, revealing a huge bravery, narrated by Veloso (Camões, 1997, VI. 48):
This one, who helps him I didn't want to
 For not causing intestinal discord,
 Tells you: when the law intended
 From the kingdom there from the Iberian lands,
 In Lusitanians I saw so much boldness,
 Both prime and such divine parts,
 That they alone could, if not error,
 Support your part to fire and iron.
This chivalry had to be a constant in the Portuguese imagination, not just with ladies, but with all those who saw each other in trouble. This happened in England, so it would succeed in southern China, when the Portuguese helped the Chinese to clean the pirate seas and in reward were allowed a quiet existence in Macao.
In fact, even if only a myth or a legend, it would only have its reason for being, because it reveals a certain collective image that the Portuguese have of themselves and that greatly contributes, in terms of existential value, to guide the conduct of the population: they are where they are accurate, in helping the most unprotected, in one hand the heart, the heart. This is an image that once mitigated, it may be that "nothing that is everything."
Regarding the founding of Macao, the scholar, faces an interesting mix between myth and reality: first comes reality, then the legend comes, and the latter will have infinitely more weight, but be aware of the following information of unsuspected thinkers and historians.
Luís Gonzaga Gomes, in Macao - A Municipality with History (1997) in the chapter “Divergent Theses on the Origin of Macao”, argues that there are several theses about the foundation of Macao as a Chinese space ruled by Portuguese from 1557, and this date does not exclude that the Portuguese had already walked through those stops since 1555, the height of Fernão Mendes Pinto, where the first time appears of the name of the name Macao related to the Portuguese.
As for theses there are three most credible:
“1) Macao was donated to the Portuguese; 2) This donation was made in rewarding the services provided by Portuguese in the destruction of pirates; and 3) the occurrence took place in 1577” (GOMES, 1997, 26) later, after presenting several points of view, linked to remarkable liters, including Álvaro Semedo, as Chinese, argues that “Macau outside the Portuguese reason Exposed, what is to reward the valuable feat of the destruction of piracy in the seas of southern China ”(GOMES, 1997, 37). In this sense, it is mentioned by several authors, and as a misrepresented as expectable, the name of the fearsome chief of the pirates, which will have valid the famous imperial edict or plate, is called Tchang Si Lao, or Sam Chislao, or Charempum, Litauquiem, or Similao (Gomes, 1997, 37).
This finding does not exclude other more commercial readings from obtaining this platform, which was also commercial in China, and a price for the payment of the ground forum in Da Ming Shi (大明史 History of the Ming Dynasty) quoted by A.J. H. Chargignon, of 20,000 rights in Macau. (GOMES, 1997, 34).
The coexistence of both chronology versions of the history of Macao will be found. XVI-XVII centuries organized by historian Beatriz Basto da Silva (1992), who reassembles an important episode of annihilation of a certain and dangerous pirate Lam Chin at 1547, in a description of Chinese employee Lam Hei-Yuen, who shot the following way “and so the pirates who had acted comfortable for 20 years were won in one day. contrary they protect us against them, they did not do any harm to our people, but they even did the Chinese well ”(Yuen apud Silva, 1992, 33), being presented in the same chronology the year 1554 as the first verbal agreement by Leonel Sousa, which legalizes the situation of payment of commercial rights and“ Portuguese are allowed to be freely trade in the area that would become Macao ”. (SILVA, 1992, 39), dating from 1557 in this chronology the establishment of the first Portuguese in Macao, a date that agrees with the advanced by Luís Gonzaga Gomes, as well as in the suicide of the Chan-Si-Lau pirate and the defeat of the pirates of Rio das Pearls, as well as Leonel Sousa “obtain authorization to establish the previous settlement of the Portuguese in Macau (…) from Macau. ” (SILVA, 1992, 43).
In fact, there is the coexistence of the two most likely origins for the founding of Macau in the chronology of Beatriz Basto da Silva. It was asked: It would have been the verbal agreement and the subsequent settlement, with the payment of the floor of the ground, possible if the effective help of the Portuguese gentlemen and warriors had not been verified to the Chinese authorities, through concrete help to local traders who were constantly pressured by coans who then abounded in the seas of China and southern China?
The cleaning of maritime ground, provided by developed technology, at the best in the world, greatly contributed to helping if it had made it concrete and real, slowly deserving of a western people of the far east of Asia and only because it was really useful in combating pirates could make a legend, since from the beginning either readings was valid but partial. In order to obtain a correct and impartial reading of what has happened, it is believed that it is necessary to combine them, understanding how decisive it was in the good relationship of the two peoples to combat pirates, without them, there would not have been Macao, flushed by foreigners in Chinese territory.

After buying the map, we realize the green spots that this city is filled with gardens. From Tricycle we arrived at a two -star hotel, despite the offering of the four -star accommodation, with discounts, just for some more exchanges allow us to enjoy superior quality of comfort. With the bags already in the room, it is at the reception that we learn about the existence in the city of a brush museum.
Considered the capital of brushes, because according to a saying, the huzhou brushes, the role of Xuan de Xuanzhou rice (Anhui), the paint from China de Huizhou (also in Anhui) and the Duan Stone for the Zhaoqing (Guangdong) paint, are the four treasures of Chinese painting.
Right on the trip to the hotel I could see it is the small town because, from the bus terminal, in ten minutes we are in the center, traveling half the main avenue that longitudinally divides it. Now walking, we will have a channel with terrace on the banks. It looks like a good place to in the shadow, quietly refreshing from the noon. We are in the Hebin Garden. Still sitting and then wave us with a glass and a bottle. After an affirmative gesture, they bring a glass full of green tea leaves and hot water in a thermal container, which on the table is to serve.
Soon appearances appear that for a Reminbi they remove the dust in their shoes, giving them a small polydela. Glasses quickly tormented rest and an EHRU player experiences, with amplifier sounds, captivating us to enjoy a few songs. But his little introduction to the song of “Yue Liang Wo Di Chin” (the moon represents my heart) proves to be more annoying than cultural.
Studying a busy but narrow pedestrian street where, despite the surrounding buildings, they are unmistakable from the environment, a recent dragon door gives access to the part of the city where a long time is perpetuated. Another longmen, this old and made of wood, gives the smoke temple, which will be from the same period and where the floor is arranged. Abroad, a number of antique sellers spread the articles on the floor.
We went through clothing stores and between two of these stores, a cubicle with a counter where some people expect that from the coal grill on the ember to be ready for the skewers of different pieces of meat stuck in a long toothpick. We snack on Carneiro to deceive the stomach because they start to be hours of dinner. We are walking attentive to the restaurants, which in the distance are distinguished, as marked by red round lanterns.
Avenida dos Hotels
It is on Hongqi Lu Street, where most hotels are found, which due to the appearance we chose the restaurant, after going through many fast food, both Chinese and the two main foreign brands. At the entrance, a part of sales abroad with a lot of demand, we refer to being in a good place. Thoughts disguise the waiting time, when they tell us to be the pre-payment restaurant and there is no list to choose the dishes. Meats already cooked are mostly barbecue and are exposed in the sales sector, behind glass.
Five in the afternoon and already with the passwords bought for the meal, chosen by the dishes of the tables of customers there for dinner. We are served to tofu soaked in soy sauce and a halted hazeln ease with meat stuffing, floating in a soup. Cheap food to serve as dinner after the job.
Smoken in flavor, we are interrupted by a corcovered beggar of a certain age that seems to ask for money. Offering what we are eating, so all the food is emptied for the bowl and not even the sauce. Faced with such hunger, found later when we saw her in the stairs to eat, we still offer you money to another meal.
Mendicity is a recent phenomenon in China, although there have always been two types of people who walk through the streets and seem beggars. Those who vague live their fate, indifferent and whose people offer them food and those who in poorer places migrate to cities. Of course there are already beggars as well.
The sound of music comes out of stores and the foreign fast food restaurant uses a powerful column where a young maid dances to the sound of children for children, waiting for them to accompany her.
We tried to prove the specialties of the land and therefore, at the Huzhou Hotel restaurant, of two stars, tasted referenced dishes as local kitchen. We were served a fish flower, fish dish that, after baking in a bittersweet sauce, is twisted with his skin to serve as a flower-shaped chalice and thus presented. But it is at the four -star Hotel Zhebei that an exquisite kitchen gives us a tofu we miss.
The price is cheaper than the previous one. This restaurant had been recommended by two young women, who were waiting for their friends and whom a maid asks for help communicating with us, when we one day we climbed to the second floor of a cooked food restaurant at the table, the vulgar Hot-Pot. Realizing that they only serve vegetables, meat or seafood, to be cooked in the heated pan over a gas nozzle in the center of the table, we get up and prepare to leave.
Requestly ask us in English the reason we leave. Then comes the two young college students in Hangzhou, who lived at the family home. Explaining this is not the food that feels like us, we took the opportunity to ask for other regional food restaurants. Since apologizing to Huzhou for not having many restaurants, they present the best and cheap price the restaurant of the Zhebei Hotel.
After a harrowing and as it is early, as in China starts dinner at five in the afternoon, we returned to the avenue and then the hotel from where we saw another, also four stars, the International Huzhou. Continuing on the same ride, we found the Tian Yun silk store. Then a brush store, where there is for all sizes and prices, reaching porcelain or bamboo cable brushes, costing thousands of yuans.
Brushes Museum
Diving into Huzhou's past, entering one of the city's most picturesque streets. A Christian church dominates the street and around, stores occupy the part under the two -story houses. By the solidoes in the heads of some people, we realize that some of the business belong to Muslims. After refusing to be photographed, a tangerine salesman offers us a delicious fruit piece. Continuing, curiosity leads us to meet the stone bridge with three arches built in 1539, with some embedded ornamental stones.
Hence and to southwest, we go to the garden of the painter and calciple Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) Painter Museum. This was native of Wuxing (today Huzhou), named after courtesy and pseudonyms Songxue, Oubo and Shuijinggong Daoren. He was a descendant prince of the Song Dynasty, but he served the Mongols Yuan Dynasty as an official at the Hanlin Academy.
As a painter, he specializes in the representation of horses and used recreating themes and styles of the old masters, with simple colors to make the landscapes. In addition to being a master of Tang Dynasty techniques, he was an excellent Caligraph, considered one of the main four in the history of Chinese calligraphy.
Already in the garden, the serenity with which the green of the vegetation is combined in the lake with the brown of the rest pavilions, or in the woods of the tea houses, it takes us there a long time, recreating figures with the reflection in the waters of the ornamental stones. We have to leave the garden to visit the Brushes Museum which, despite being encompassed in the same room, has an autonomous entrance. Huzhou brushes are referenced as the best in the country and so you have to see how they are made.
In chronological terms, the brush was invented in the late 3rd century A.N.E. By Meng Tian, ​​a military commander of the Qin Dynasty. However, it is perceived by the painted vessels of different neolithic cultures, which must have existed for at least five thousand years. Therefore, Meng Tian will be linked, not to the invention, but to the improvement of brushes. Also the city of Huzhou is not the real place of production of the best brushes, but has won this title since in ancient times Shanlian, in the municipality of Wuxing, province of Zhejiang, was over his jurisdiction. The handwriting brushes made had their heyday during the Yuan Dynasty and are still considered among the best in all of China.
Four steps are required to manufacture the HU brush, and the coat of the rabbit, the fingernail and the goat hair is used. After the fat is removed with tire juice, the hair is cut into equal sizes and enter a solution to clean them. They are then united at the base with arabic gum and after drying, united with a tile that unites them to the bamboo.
With the brush made in its structure, the other phase of the process is passed. The hair is bumped to a porridge made of algae to put them together and with the wire wrapped a tip is created, the most important part of the brush. This wire that goes through the hair, on a lap gives the cone shape and also serves to remove the excess of the agglutinator papa.
With extreme patience and skill, the brushes are clean, rounded, creating a tip, with good elasticity. Then the brush, ready, passes to the hands of another employee, where in the bamboo cable are recorded the characters Tian Kuan Trade Mark, which replaced the old “double goat” brand.
The goat hair (HAO) brushes (HAO) are soft and serve to write small characters, rabbit hair are hard and those of the fingernail are between the two, with great elasticity for the handwriting of large characters. Sometimes a mixture of different hair is made, using those of other animals.
There are brushes of all kinds of sizes, serving some to paint and others to call. The best for Chinese handwriting are the rabbit and goat hair mix. HU brushes were widely used in the imperial court.
In the other part of the museum is the painter's room Zhao Mengfu with its utensils and some works, where the recorded stones are not lacking. Although the museum has a sales section, after leaving the museum and already on the street, a set of stores is dedicated to the sale of products for Chinese painting.
Leaving the brushes, we visited the market and crossing a wooden bridge in Zig-Zag, we traveled another old part of the city. Clothing extenders hide salespeople with bags full of tea leaves finished spoon that belong to the first harvest of the year, the best.
Our stay in Huzhou also serves to visit places at an hour of bus, such as Anji, to see the Bamboo Museum and already outside Zhejiang province in Jiangsu, Dingshan, referenced as the place of production of the best tea services. The southern bank of Taihu is the border line between the Huzhou district in Zhejiang province and Jiangsu province, where Lake Tai expands.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>The German government yesterday accused China of having pointed to a laser to a German military plane on a mission in the Red Sea to protect maritime traffic against Huthis attacks, adding to the Chinese ambassador.

The government assured that between the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth will be released more data and completed revitalizations of old zones
 
The revitalization of the 23-25 ​​quay in the interior port area and the eternal happiness courtyard should be completed later this year, being interconnected with the projects designed and funded between the executive and the six game operators for six ancient Macao zones.
The warranty was given yesterday by the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP. "The revitalization of the six zones is a priority task for the government, because we have to rely on the investments of the dealers. We have done studies, made an arrangement of the resources and now we know what we have. We want, at the end of the third quarter, beginning of the four quarter, to be able to advance with more details."
More concretely, it was up to a representative of the Cultural Institute to confirm that the rehabilitation of the eternal happiness courtyard and pier 23-25 ​​is completed at the same time.
Tai Kin IP has ensured that the government “is not stopped” while analyzing and studies. “We have already given instructions [to dealers] for the work that can be adjusted. We ask dealers to do the analysis depending on the characteristics of the zones. We will complete the structures [this year], with remodeling and restoration works, and we are working.”
The secretary stressed that the type of consumption is also being analyzed in these six zones, according to the type of tourists, with "two categories of consumption, the traditional and new generations."
“I ask you to accelerate”
Despite the promises of more detail, the deputies mourned the lack of more detailed information. “The essentials is to publicize the projects, because the government has to conduct certain investments and guide the market. Can the government have time to do the studies, but will small and medium -sized businesses take this time on studies? Will stores that are in the six zones continue to explore the activity?” Asked Deputy Ron Lam.
According to the deputy, the ideas for the six zones should result in a “transparent and publicized project to the public”, because “the whole society [has to be heard] so that all projects can reflect the market panorama”.
Another critical voice was that of IP Sio Kai, who asked for a comprehensive revitalization. “Everyone expects changes in the community economy. Concessionaires are committed to the six zones, but have passed two and a half years [since the announcement of the projects]. Of course there has been transition work, but there are new conception plans and everything should be done at the same time. For example, there may be obstacles to the conception of plans, because we have the street of happiness very close to the courtyard of eternal happiness, and it can be revitalized the surrounding areas.

Highlight for the absences of Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin
 
Since Saturday, Rio de Janeiro hosts the BRICS Group leaders, which ends today. The first day was based on the dialogue around the ambition of emerging economies to reform international institutions and the defense of multilateralism.
"I think the main message is this: at the time of so many international crises, conflicts, we are experiencing a succession of conflicts that only increase from year to year, having a set of countries reaffirming the power of diplomacy, cooperation, the need to act jointly, to solve the problems of the population and not to generate more destruction, such as conflicts, it is an opportunity that we always have to take advantage," Lyrio, guide to discussions and agreements of heads of state at the conference, designated by the Brazilian presidency of the BRICS.
In all, about 30 countries and nine international organizations have been present, with the Brazilian head of state, Lula da Silva leading the meeting, which has Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Angola President and African Union, the Secretary-General of United Nations, António Guterres, among others.
The main absences are Russian and Chinese heads of state, two BRICS founding countries. Vladimir Putin, the target of a warrant of detention issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), on suspicion of illegal deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia, will only participate in video conferencing.
Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will be the representatives of the two founding countries of the group, which represents more than 40 percent of the global population and more than 35 percent of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
From China with Love
According to Chinese state agency Xinhua, Chinese prime minister promised to “expand cooperation with Brazil” in the areas of “digital and aerospace economy”. Li Qiang spoke on Saturday, as part of a meeting with Lula da Silva, noting that the country intends to “work with Brazil to take advantage of each other and expand cooperation in areas such as digital economy, green economy, scientific and technological and aerospace innovation”.
Xinhua quotes words from Li Qiang, who referred to the fact that “China is ready to work with Brazil to continue efforts to enrich the dimensions of bilateral relations and achieve more concrete results in cooperation in order to provide more benefits to both peoples”.
One of the points out of this meeting was the realization in 2026 of the year of China-Brazil culture, which provides for an intensification in cooperation in areas such as “education, youth and health”, in order to facilitate “more exchanges between peoples and strengthen public support to China-Brazil's friendship and cooperation”.
“China is willing to work with Brazil to further consolidate and deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, finance and infrastructure development within the high quality cooperation of Belt And Road [track and route]”, the Chinese prime minister, who did not forget the great flag of this BRICS Summit: multilateralism.
Thus, I read Qiang considered “the two countries as fierce defenders of multilateralism and free trade”, saying that “China is willing to improve communication and coordination with Brazil in multilateral structures such as the United Nations, BRICS and G20, work in union with developing countries to promote an equal and ordered multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and provide more certainty and stability to the world. ”
On the other hand, Lula da Silva said that "Brazil is willing to deepen communication and multilateral coordination with China, to oppose unilateralism and defend multilateralism and free trade in order to promote peace and world development." After the meeting between the two leaders, “cooperation documents in areas such as tax and financial matters, artificial intelligence, alignment of development strategies and aerospace” were signed.

Cuba's debut
Cuba President Miguel Díaz-Canel also participates in the 17th BRICS Summit, being the first time Cuba has associated with this geopolitical and economic cooperation group.
Under the motto “reinforcing cooperation in the global south for more inclusive and sustainable governance”, the BRICS Summit's agenda comprises two central axes: the consolidation of cooperation between the global southern countries and the promotion of reforms in international governance mechanisms.
Created in 2009 throughout Brazil, Russia, India and China, Brics admitted South Africa two years later and since last year has been part of six new effective members: Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Iran, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. Brazil invited to this summit leaders from various Latin American countries, including Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay and Chile.
The status of associate, which takes Cuba to Rio de Janeiro, was approved in October 2024 during the summit of the group held in the Russian city of Kazan, which was made official in 2025, recalled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean country.
In addition to geopolitical issues, the BRICS have sought in Rio de Janeiro in the organization's economic weight, namely in the financial domain, in which they have been looking for an alternative to the dollar for trade in the group.
The host president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, president of Brazil, stressed last Friday the importance of a mechanism with these characteristics, recognizing, however, that the current international political context is "complicated".
What is on the agenda
On the first day, the heads of state and government of the BRICS participated in two plenary sessions, particularly on "peace and security and reform of global governance" and the second relative to the strengthening of multilateralism, economic and financial affairs and artificial intelligence. "
In the latter, the revision of the ACCIORARY participation in the World Bank, the realignment of IMF shares [International Monetary Fund] and the increase in the representation of developing countries in leadership positions in international financial institutions and the importance of reforming the UN Security Council.
In addition, as it has been happening during the BRICS ministerial meetings over the past few months, an increase in unilateral unilateral unilateral protectionist measures should be made in reference to the measures announced by the President of the United States, Donald Trump; as well as an appeal to reinforce the use of local currencies in trade between the bloc countries. Today the plenary session will be on “Environment, COP30 and Global Health”.
The term BRIC was created by a Goldman Sachs analyst to refer to emerging economies who began to stand out worldwide beyond the US, and the BRICS first gathered at the level of heads in 2009. This is the first meeting that brings together the new group configuration with 11 member countries.
Brazil has mobilized about 20,000 military personnel, as well as fighters with missiles, anti-drug systems and elite shooters to ensure the safety of the event. The safety operation, called Operational Command Redeemer Set, also provides for the use of 300 vehicles, 38 armored vehicles, 18 boats and eight helicopters.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 04:58:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Cape Verde | Évora family, between Macau and the rest of the world</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/cabo-verde-familia-evora-entre-macau-e-o-resto-do-mundo/</link><description>Tomorrow are 50 years of Cape Verde's independence, the country from which the first levada of the Évora family came out in the 1940s, towards Macao, where he won roots. Nowadays, only one member of the family remains in the territory, the cardiologist Mário Évora
 
There were once a dozen Évoras in Macau, where they arrived in the 1940s, but only Mario Évora resists, with the family repeating the migrations that mark both Cape Verde and the Macanese.
"We have been between eight and ten Évoras in Macau," Sports Medicine expert Humberto Évora told Lusa from Lisbon, where he has lived since he renovated. The maternal grandparents of Humberto (the last of the family to be born in Cape Verde) and Mário (the first to be born in Macau) arrived in the east in the late 1940s, with five of the couple's six children.
A year later, the daughter who had stayed with her husband in Cape Verde came to Macau, already with baby Humberto. The initial plan was for two years, but the couple ended up three decades and have three more children: Mario, Rui and Maria Helena.
In 1971, it was Humberto and Mário's turn to leave to study medicine in Lisbon, but not without a great fright linked to the colonial war that had lasted a decade ago.
"As we went to the university we could postpone military inspection, but the papers did not come from Macao and we risk being considered refractory," said Humberto. The situation resolved, but Mario admitted to Lusa the fear of the mobilization. "We had this persecution, we had to go through the year not to go with the sides in the war," he explained.
“The Shock” in Lisbon
Upon arrival in Lisbon, “we were soon welcomed and integrated into the Cape Verdean student community,” said Humberto, at a time of student agitation and politics. "There were periods when it was almost daily, manifestations of students against the regime, the shock police enter the canteen inside and give some suckling," said Mario.
Humberto admitted that "it was a shock, for those who came from Macau, where there was little political culture and the colonial war was seen as a struggle against terrorists." In a summer, the young man, who was integrated into a Cape Verdean group of intervention music, left with a friend "to the overseas ride out of guitar on his back."
“I always remember the first time in France, that I saw the colonial war described on the contrary on television, the struggle for the liberation of a colonial power of occupation,” said Humberto.
Independence
When the two brothers finished the medical course, the independence of Cape Verde, on July 5, 1975, led them to the root return. "There was a movement of many of our colleagues to contribute to a new country, which was beginning to take the first steps," said Mario, then a formed cardiologist.
Also because, recalled Humberto, some of the friends of Lisbon had, however, became members of the Government of Cape Verde. "There was this possibility, but the return to Macao, a place where it had spent so long, was natural," he explained. “I was born in Cape Verde, I spent part of my life in Portugal, I grew up in Macao, I am also Macaense. I am a citizen of the world,” said Humberto.
Macanese are a Euro-Asian community, most of which Lusodescendants, with roots in Macau, although many have emigrated, due to the economic situation or fear created by the transition from Portugal Administration to China in 1999.
From the Évora brothers, Rui, engineer, left before the transition to Cape Verde, where he even worked on the project of the Hotel-Casino that Macau's businessman David Chow built on the beach, but was inaugurated.
The younger sister, Maria Helena, expert in documentary sciences who even worked in the historical archive of Macau, is currently in the City Council of Oeiras. The children “are all out” between the United Kingdom, Cape Verde and Portugal, said Mario. "Now the world is smaller and it is going where there are opportunities," he said.
Humberto also faces migrations "as a natural process, not only for Cape Verdeans, but even to the Macanese."
Nothing that has prevented the two brothers from keeping their ties with the archipelago. Humberto divides the time between Portugal and Cape Verde, and has been the official doctor of Cape Verdean sports for decades to the main international competitions.
Mario was one of the founders-and president for ten years-of the Macau-Cabo Green Friendship Association. "We had here Ildo Lobo, Tito Paris, and my cousin," said the cardiologist, before taking a break and adds, with a smile: "Cesaria Évora."</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:18:00</pubDate></item><item><title>About 97 percent of Spanish adolescents victim of sexual aggression on the internet</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/cerca-de-97-por-cento-dos-adolescentes-espanhois-vitima-de-agressao-sexual-na-internet/</link><description>About 97 percent of teenagers in Spain is the victim of some kind of sexual violence on the internet, warned yesterday the Save the Children Non-Governmental Organization (NGO).
The NGO released a report yesterday with the title “Networks that hold. Sexual exploitation of childhood and adolescence in digital environments”, which elaborated with the European Association for Digital Transition and which includes official data and an inquiry to over 1,000 young people aged 18 to 21.
According to the study, 97 percent of these young people said they were victims of some kind of sexual violence on the Internet during adolescence, including contacts from adults for sexual purposes, unauthorized diffusion of intimate images or blackmail and threats to send intimate and sexual content.
Another type of violence enhanced in the report is the use of artificial intelligence tools to create sexual content from a real image of adolescents or children (content known as 'Deepfake' or 'Ultra counterfeits').
According to the study, one in five young Spaniards was the victim of the creation and diffusion of these 'Deepfake' during adolescence, namely with sharing by another person, to third parties, and without consent, of their own nudity images, elaborated through artificial intelligence.
"The Internet, social networks and technologies not only facilitate capture and exposure to sexual exploitation -related risks, but can be the means by which these violence against boys and girls are committed and allow their perpetuation," said Save the Children, in a statement released from the study published yesterday.
Starter
Social networks are the most frequent way for aggressors to start contacts with the teenage victims, with the study also highlighting online video games in the case of boys. After this first contact, they move to applications and messages of messages such as WhatsApp, Telegram or Discord.
Girls are the ones that most denounce to be pressured to send intimate content (28.5 percent of 18.4 percent of boys), with the study that all victims had shared personal or intimate information on the Internet during childhood and adolescence.
According to the study, only 50 percent of young people when they were smaller considered contact with unknown people one of the main risks of the internet and only 32.9 percent mentioned as dangerous the consented send of intimate images to adults.
On the other hand, 70 percent states that it has not seen as a risk, in adolescence, the manipulation of photographs and videos with artificial intelligence. Asked the reasons why they sent intimate or sexual images of themselves, 48 ​​percent says it did not know it was something potentially dangerous, 46 percent weighed that it was normal and 42 percent sought attention, affection or some kind of validation.
Alone at home
In this context, Save the Children warns, in the study, for the lack of follow -up of minors; The scarce digital formation, in cybersecurity, privacy and recognition of danger situations and the intensive use of technologies by children and adolescents.
According to data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Spain, cited in the NGO report, in 2023 there were 4,896 complaints for offenses on the Internet against children and adolescents, 1,068 of which were sexual crimes.
"These numbers represent only the tip of the iceberg, as most cases do not know, in part, for the absence of denunciation and, in part, for the difficulties in detection, which increases when these facts take place in an online environment," said Save The Children Catalina Perazzo, cited in the NGO statement.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 01:11:37</pubDate></item><item><title>WHO | Study reveals that one in six people in the world feels</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/oms-estudo-revela-que-uma-em-cada-seis-pessoas-no-mundo-sente-se-so/</link><description>A World Health Organization report states that loneliness is a growing problem. Based on a study conducted between 2014 and 2023, the document concluded that one in six people in the world feel alone, with emphasis on young people from 13 to 29 years old. The Southeast Asian region has, however, less problematic values
 
More and more is spoken of the devastating impact of loneliness as a potentializing cause of diseases. This time, a report from the World Health Organization (WHO), released on Monday and carried out by the Social Connection Commission, brings data on the problem, concluding that one in six people say he feels alone, a state that is not synonymous with being alone.
Moreover, the problem is greater in younger ones, because one in five says it feels alone, which shows that one fifth of the world's population between 13 and 29 years old says it feels loneliness.
The study, entitled “From Solitude to Social Connection - tracing a path to healthier societies: WHO Commission on Social Connection Commission”, focuses on 2013 and 2024, thus encompassing the pandemic, a period when most of the world populations faced confinement periods, some of them alone in their dwellings. The study was sent to journalists from 194 WHO member countries, and the data were dealt with in line with other works already done on the subject and with the support of experts from around the world, including from China. Bin Yu, from the Medical College Tianjin University, was one of the project participants.
The report points out that between 2014 and 2023 "it is estimated that 16 percent of people around the world-one in six-felt loneliness," something that "affects all ages and regions." However, it is a “more common feeling among adolescents and young adults”, with a rate of 20.9 percent of young people between 13 and 17 years old, while the rate reduces slightly to 17.4 percent in the case of young adults from 18 to 29 years.
The feeling of loneliness "decreases with age", and is also "more common in low-income countries, where almost one in four people (24 percent) claimed to feel lonely."
The WHO study also points out that “the highest rates are in the WHO African region”, with 24 percent; Following the regions of the Eastern Mediterranean (21 percent), and in Southeast Asia this feeling is less felt by respondents, registering only 18 percent.
"The European region has the lowest rate, with about ten percent," says WHO, which distinguishes loneliness of social isolation. In this field, “data is more limited”, but the isolation of the elderly stands out. "Estimates suggest that 25-34 percent of the elderly are socially isolated," it is data on the years between 1990 and 2022.
When it comes to adulthood, from 30 to 59 years, the percentage of people who feel only low to 15.1 percent, and in people 60 years or older, with 11.8 percent.
Regarding gender, “estimated rates of loneliness in women and men are similar (16.1 and 15.4 percent, respectively), with the highest estimated differences between adolescents (24.3 percent between women and 17.2 percent between men) and the elderly (13 percent between women and 9.9 percent among men)”.
Who else feels
The report states that nowadays “social disconnection is widespread in all regions and in all age groups”, with consequences that are “serious and underestimated, affecting mortality, physical and mental health, well-being, education, economy and society in general”. "Its widespread occurrence and its serious consequences make it a serious issue of global public health," it is mentioned.
And who feels more alone? The WHO highlights “marginalized groups”, namely “people with disabilities, lesbians, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer (or sometimes in question) and other individuals (LGBTIQ+) and migrants”. These people “are more likely to feel loneliness and isolation than other groups”, making it the caveat that “previous data are too limited to determine whether social isolation and solitude rates have increased or decreased”.
In the case of disabled people, scenarios persist such as being unable to “access social facilities and take advantage of opportunities due to physical barriers in buildings, limited access to transportation and lack of affordable information and communication, while others face structural stigma that limits their job opportunities or other sociocultural barriers that lead to lower level of education, less stable relationships and more precarious housing conditions”.
"Many factors" are identified that lead people to feel alone, namely "modernization, industrialization and technological changes", and may be "responsible for what, often, it is presumed to be an increase in social isolation and loneliness, but most remain without proof."
"We know that certain factors increase the risk of individuals suffering from social disconnection. These include poor physical or mental health (especially depression), personality traits such as neuroticism, not having a partner or being single, living alone and characteristics of the built environment, such as poor access to public transport. The impact of digital technology is not yet clear, but experts recommend caution, especially to protect the mental health and well-being of young people." study.
The WHO highlights, throughout the text, how it is difficult to quantify feelings of loneliness, being relatively recent this type of definitions and, above all, differentiation between the feeling of feeling alone and being effectively only. The report includes testimonies from people from various countries and cultures that describe that, even though they are with a partner or friends, they feel alone in a scenario caused by many factors.
In the case of young people, "the finding of high loneliness rates between adolescents is consistent with the results of previous research, although the result may be subject to both developmental and methodological considerations."
“As loneliness results from a perceived discrepancy between real and desired or expected social connections, the highest rate in adolescence can be due to higher expectations of social connections during the development phase, which is marked by significant emotional and psychological changes. The elderly report comparatively greater satisfaction with their social relations. According to these estimates, the elderly have the lowest loneliness rates, which contradicts previous studies that enhanced the elderly as the age range with some of the highest rates. This may be due to the limited availability and quality of the previous data on the elderly, ”is explained.
The study highlights, however, that it is “possible that the prevalence of loneliness is greater among adults over 80 or older”, which is a “consistent conclusion with previous studies, in which there was a distribution in the form of 'U' of loneliness among older adults”.
More than 800 thousand deaths
We are in an era where so -called social health is at risk, being considered by WHO as "a vital but often neglected, health, as essential as physical and mental health."
"Social relations can reduce the risk of disease, increase life expectancy and strengthen the fabric of communities and society. Social relations improve life, giving us meaning and a feeling of belonging," it is also read, being mentioned that today loneliness affects one in six people worldwide and causes "about 871,000 deaths annually (2014-2019)".
"New estimates suggest that loneliness alone may be responsible for about 871,000 deaths a year. The economic cost of these comprehensive impacts on society is just starting to be understood. Estimates suggest substantial costs for employers, health systems and individuals. Stronger social connections provide important protection in health, social and economic domains," he reads.
The report points out that many of these issues only now begin to be perceived and analyzed. "This has probably been happening for years, but the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and the growing concern for digital technology has brought more attention to the issue, including governments," he is explained.
The WHO also points to a correlation between poverty or low income and the feeling of loneliness.
"In general, the lower the performance group in a country, the higher the solitude rate. It is estimated that low-yielding countries have the higher (24.3 percent), followed by medium-low-yield countries (19.3 percent), medium-high performance countries (12.1 percent) and high-performance countries (10.6 percent)," he can be read.
Despite some worrying scenarios, WHO leaves some suggestions and even says that "there is hope" to get around the problem. "There are effective strategies for promoting social connection and these must be expanded," for example, by the "regular monitoring of the prevalence of social connection, social isolation and solitude at the global, regional and national level." This monitoring should be viewed as "a high priority", allowing "to track progress and measure the impact of strategies to deal with the issue."
It is also suggested the “international development and adoption of reliable measuring instruments, interculturally valid for social connection, social isolation and loneliness”, and as a priority ”should be viewed the creation“ of an instrument to measure social connection, as conceived in this report: in the three dimensions of structure, function and quality ”.
The study was based on reference documents on global and regional estimates of the prevalence of loneliness and mortality due to loneliness, “the first of this type”; a global review of political documents; Network mapping and analysis, the inclusion of 64 experiences experienced by people in relation to social connection, social isolation and loneliness, as well as “high quality evidence, prioritizing systematic revisions, meta-analysis and large-scale multinational studies”, without forgetting the experience of the WHO technical advisory group itself, “composed of 20 renowned global experts”.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 23:24:44</pubDate></item><item><title>China-Portuguese | Chengdu Pavilion shows Portuguese products</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/china-portugal-pavilhao-em-chengdu-mostra-produtos-portugueses/</link><description>In the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion venture in Chengdu, pavilions for foreign countries and entrepreneurs who want to establish business in China are installed. Portugal is also there, represented by the Portugal Pavilion, but according to manager Ângelo Sousa, there is a lack of support from the Portuguese government and strength to combat competition
 
“For us there are no barriers between Portugal and China. We are 365 days here and there.” This is the way the objectives of the team that is behind the Portugal Pavilion present at the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion are presented in Chengdu and which is managed by two partners: Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa.
The two realized that the Shanghai zone had reached a saturation point in the trade of products and that it was necessary to go more to the interior of the country to try to sell things as Portuguese as wine, cod or olive oil.
HM talked to Yinhui Tui about this project on the fringes of a lunch in Lisbon by the Friends of the New Seda Route Association, chaired by Fernanda Ilhéu. The event served precisely for Yinhui Tui to present the objectives of the Portugal Pavilion and try to capture business interests.
“This is a very important market for Portuguese products. In China we have separated the country [in commercial terms] in four markets. We have the region of Beijing and Shanghai, which we call 'Yangtze River Economic Zone', and 'Pearl River Economic Zone'. The fourth zone is composed by the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing and which is a new economic area established in 2020. Portuguese have a lot of potential in these markets, ”he said.
The entrepreneur recalls that the marketing of Portuguese products is still below the one that is done by French, Spanish or other countries, but when the Chinese buyer discovers wine or olive oil, he is surprised.
"In Shanghai, for example, some customers already have their opinion on French or Australians. But many think that Portuguese products have more quality," said Yinhui Tui, noting that in the area where the Portugal Pavilion operates in Sichuan province, "people are a little more conservative and prefer to try, prove and feel before buying."
"Our pavilion is next to the French pavilion and we often see customers opt for French wine. But when they go through our pavilion, they see our brands and ask what we have. When they realize that we have cheaper wine compared to French, they are surprised and say it is better, and then buy."
This responsible explains that the population in the fourth economic zone is 130 million people, much more than the number of people living in the Iberian Peninsula. "Then I think it's a market with a lot of potential," he said.
The Role of Lusosino
Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa created Lusosino that it acts as the managing entity of the pavilion, which was born “with the intention of promoting Portuguese products in the Great Market of China”. Thus, there is a “showroom” of very Portuguese products, representing some brands known as is the case of Vieira crackers, Esporão wine, Sal Marnoto, the Prisca jams or Vista Alegre, among others. It is in this pavilion that "exhibitors display the best products, buyers discover trends and where they both find the conditions to realize business." Moreover, Lusosino, through this pavilion, helps Portuguese entrepreneurs in marketing campaigns and in the best way to contact potential Chinese customers.
Specifically, Lusosino promises to perform “producer and brands records, commercial representation, market analysis, market support and preparation, among other services”, reads on the website.
However, and according to Ângelo Freitas de Sousa to HM, there are many obstacles to putting Portuguese products in China. “[The Chengdu and Chongqing zone] has the advantage of being a growing market that is not overloaded with exporters and has no addictions as happens in the Shanghai zone. It is a very large market and where there are many producers.” By addictions, the entrepreneur refers to “competition” from other countries and buying habits of Chinese customers, who are faster looking for products from other nationalities than from Portugal. "There are habits of certain brands that are implemented and people don't even look at others or experience them."
The Portuguese Pavilion project began with an idea of ​​Ângelo Ferreira de Sousa, who has a Chinese wife who helps him in the business. “I met Yinhui Tui, he liked Portuguese products, we were friends and then we ended up joining energy,” he said, explaining that the interior of the country is still knowing foreign products, not just Portuguese.
"The Shanghai zone has nowhere to grow and this is a growing economic zone. There are many factories that are moving to Chengdu, so there will be more development," he said.
Absence of marketing
The Portuguese entrepreneur regrets that the Portuguese authorities have given little support to the project, except for any follow -up by AICEP - Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade of Portugal.
"All the investment was made by us and we have not had a lot of support. We had some help from AICEP, but nothing special. We do fairs, the showrooms, to prove and know our products in major cities," said Angelo Ferreira de Sousa.
The entrepreneur also regrets that, despite the relationship of hundreds of years between Portugal and China, there is still flaws in the commercial strategy for the export of Portuguese products in the country. "The Spaniards are much further ahead than us," he said.
Regarding the role of Macao as a platform, the entrepreneur says it is equally difficult to bring products from Portugal to China or Macau to China, due to lack of customs agreements and little flexibility.
"It is not because we call Macau that I can, for example, putting sausages, cod or preserves in China, or other Portuguese products. To pass from Portugal to Macau is easy, but it is no longer so easy to take after Portuguese products from Macau to China. We have not been able to do much through Macau, but we have not sought much," he said.
At the presentation in Lisbon, Yinhui Tui advanced some figures behind the construction of the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion, and help to understand their size: about 70 billion euros of investment and a space of 300,000 cubic meters. The Portugal Pavilion does not only do contact sessions or fairs: if a businessman wants to leave tons of products there, he can do so. Then the pavilion is in charge of distribution through several areas of China. “In the southern market, closer to Macao, there is a lot of competition in some areas, so it should be betting inside China,” said Yinhui Tui, referring to the potential and factor novelty that exists in some areas of the country regarding commerce.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 00:50:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Coloane | Filipe Afonso launches work that highlights the importance of staff houses</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/24/coloane-filipe-afonso-lanca-obra-que-destaca-importancia-de-casas-de-palafitas/</link><description>The latest book by Filipe Afonso, coordinator of the Architecture course at the University of São José, looks at a housing model at risk of disappearing, but can be seen in Coloane, or in old fishing zones of Hong Kong. “Coloane Grammar” presents alternative solutions for the reuse of these houses and their classification as a heritage
 
Taking the idea of ​​grammar that names the book, what are the main terms or concepts around Coloane, its tradition and preservation, which can enumerate?
The “grammar” of the book introduces the concept of vernacular architecture, which reflects the knowledge of the informal, local construction and the maritime identity of this Coloane community. It addresses the assets at risk, proposing a method of cataloging existing houses, this digital method, which establishes a dialogue between tradition and modernity to preserve this cultural landscape.
What concrete proposals are suggested in the book for the protection and preservation of Coloane's stilts?
The book proposes (indirectly) the classification of stilts as a heritage to give them legal protection. By cataloging existing stilts, the book contributes to preserving the memory of this type of architecture and a broader discussion about its possible protection.
How could we reuse the stilts taking into account these specific ways of life and the economic diversification that the government wants to achieve?
The stilts could be reused for experience tourism, or centers of cultural interpretation, valuing local history. They can be transformed into creative and artistic spaces or in fact propose new wood buildings along the waterline, with various uses and that can generate value to the Coloane community, contributing to Macao's cultural and economic diversification.
Why approach Coloane and the stilts? How did this project come about?
Coloane and the stilts were approached by their architectural and cultural uniqueness, representing a threatened memory and identity of Macao. This assets at risk has a significant potential. The project also emerged from the gap of scientific knowledge about these structures and the urgent need for documentation, consolidating itself as an academic-scientific investigation.
In the Asian or Southeast Asian context, are the coloane stilts or not unique in architectural terms?
Water constructions are common in various Asian countries, Coloane's stilts are not a unique case in terms of existence. See the example, in Hong Kong, of the well-known Tai o village, but are unique in their specific context. Its architecture is the reflection of local regional influences and materials, adapted to the history of the evolution of Colona's fishing community and the development of Macao. Its value lies in its particular architectural language and its persistence in a rapidly transformed urban environment.
What is the story behind the emergence of stilts? Are you associated with Coloane piracy reports, for example, which refer to the early twentieth century?
The stilts emerged as a practical and functional solution to the sea -related way of life, allowing sea access, tidal protection and efficient use of space in coastal areas. Piracy reports in Coloane were not the direct cause of their emergence. Shapes are essentially the response of an informal architecture of local communities to adapt to the maritime environment.
Museum Idea on Coloane Stop Stand since 2017
The need for preservation of coloane stilts is not a recent idea. Between 2017 and 2018, the Directorate of Tourism Services proposed the creation of a museum entirely dedicated to the stories of these dwellings arranged in Rua dos Navegantes, but the project was being postponed for legal reasons.
In 2018, the Tribuna de Macao newspaper (JTM) published an article where it referred precisely the absence of “legal foundations” for the construction of new infrastructure in the Maritime area of ​​Macao, something that has changed, however, given that the MSAR passed, from 2018, to include in its jurisdiction the management of 85 square kilometers of maritime zones.
Last year alone, the executive's plans for the creation of a “functional maritime zoning”, “maritime areas” and other related laws, and a concrete decision on what will be made on what will be made on the stilts. Both zoning and plan will be defined for a temporal period by 2040.
One of the objectives of the executive is environmental and ecological preservation, as well as certain experiences of the population. One of the points of the public consultation report speaks of “optimizing ocean exploration modalities according to Macau's development needs; coordinating the use of sea in production, daily life of the population and ecology” and performing “intensive and economizers uses to realize the rational allocation of maritime resources”.
In 2018, according to the JTM, STD assured that it would be necessary to “wait for the publication of the maritime area and administrative regulation on the administration of the use of maritime zones” and only then could you think of the planning of the museum. HM questioned STD of this article, and until the closing of this edition, obtained new clarifications.
A gradual development
In a master's dissertation in architecture, defended in 2023 at the University of Coimbra, Ana Rita Rodrigues made the study of the “Evolution of Macao Territory-Aterros and Urban Design in the Taipa and Coloane islands”, and concluded that “Portuguese occupation in the islands of Taipa and Coloane brought improvements in infrastructure, safety and village organization”. In the late nineteenth century, "there were already, in the islands, schools, hospitals and basic infrastructure, promoting the economic growth of the region."
Referring to the existence of stilts “used for the construction of fishing and housing boats for fishermen, naturally facing the river”, in a coloane zone composed “by precarious housing of one or two floors, unlike the type of common housing found in mud or macau, which was more focused on high development”.
The author also points out that “development was slower” in Coloane, as well as the absence, on both islands, of “a unified general plan and the need for better urban planning to ensure a cohesive and sustainable environment”.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 23:53:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Alberto Wong complains about defamation campaign</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/eleicoes-alberto-wong-queixa-se-de-campanha-de-difamacao/</link><description>The social worker also states that he has filed a complaint with the Judicial Police, after starting to circulate online comments that connect him to investments with investments in Myanmar and the debts left to pay
 
Alberto Wong, a candidate for deputy who leads the Liveliod Popular Strength list in Macao, claims to be the victim of a defamation campaign on social networks, after some comments accuse him of having practiced mockery or leaving debts to pay. In a publication on social networks, the social worker also revealed that he filed a complaint to the Judicial Police (PJ).
"The statements to circulate on social networks aimed at my person have been made with malice and are slanderous, so they severely violate my personal dignity. Therefore, there are suspicions that the perpetrators committed the crimes of defamation and injury," wrote Alberto Wong. "I already denounced the cases to the PJ and delivered with the complaint the materials published online. The criminal case has already been installed," he said.
According to Wong, the PJ will now start an investigation and follow the tracks left by the profiles that made the comments considered defamatory by the candidate.
At the same time, Alberto Wong appealed to those who published the controversial comments to remove them immediately from the internet and apologize to him to “mitigate the impact” of the accusations he considers to be slander.
New candidate
In recent days, with the approaching elections to the Legislative Assembly of September 14, online comments came up with Albert Wong to Burla schemes. Some of the accusations claimed that Wong would have promoted real estate investments in Myanmar, but that projects would never come forward, with investors losing money.
Other comments claimed the practice of scams and also debts contracted by Alberto Wong, also known as Tim Wong, who would not have been paid.
The crime of defamation is punished with a prison sentence that can reach six months or 240 days of fine. However, depending on certain conditions, the penalty may reach two years in prison or imply a fine that can reach 360 days and will never be less than 120 days.
At the age of 40, Alberto Wong is a candidate for the first time to Hemiciclo and leads the only one of the eight lists of direct suffrage that is not represented in the Legislative Assembly. The lists have not yet been permanently accepted and are being evaluated by the State Security Defense Commission. The results of the political assessment will be presented on July 15.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 00:51:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | 13 campaign complaints received ahead of time</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/eleicoes-recebidas-13-queixas-de-campanha-antes-do-tempo/</link><description>CAEAL yesterday revealed the number of complaints related to "electoral propaganda before the campaign began." The penalty provided for in the law punishes infractors with fines ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 patacas
 
Until yesterday, the Commission of Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) received a total of 13 complaints related to the execution of electoral propagate during a period of prohibition. The numbers were updated yesterday in a press conference by Caeal President Seng Ioi Man.
"We are on the 12th day of the illegal advertising period or prohibition of advertising. So far, we have received 13 complaints. And we have paid close attention to these cases," said Seng Ioi Man. "We will follow the complaints seriously and we will cooperate with the competent authorities to follow these cases. If there is in fact advertising, we will give due treatment," he added.
According to the electoral law, electoral propaganda prior to the start of the election campaign is punished with a fine ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 patacas, so it is not one of the offenses in which the law obliges the granting of imprisonment, regardless of the severity of the offense.
Seng Ioi Man also revealed that CAEAL's analysis of the candidate list did not find out any offense until yesterday had to be supplied. "At this stage, the work of verification of the applications are running in an orderly manner. We currently do not verify any procedural irregularity or the eligible candidates, so there is no need for any candidacy to supply aspects of the list," said the president of Caeal
However, the Electoral Commission is still waiting for the State Security Defense Commission to take advantage of candidates, assessing whether they are patriotic and faithful to MSAR. "Regarding candidates who advocate or not the basic law, who are faithful or not to the MSAR, it is up to the State Security Defense Committee to determine. If uncomfortable are verified, this commission issues a binding opinion," he said. "CAEAL, based on the opinion of this committee, will take by July 15 the decision to verify the candidates and disclose all the results," he said.
More voting places
Yesterday's conference also served for Caeal to announce that, for the first time, for the indirect suffrage, two voting assemblies will be installed. In these elections only the representatives of local associations vote and the first assembly will be in the traditional place, the Macao Polytechnic University Polydestive Pavilion. In this place they will be able to vote the associations of industrial, commercial and financial sectors, work sector and sectors of social and educational services. The second voting assembly will be located at the Kao Yip School School, and will receive the votes of the professional sector and the cultural and sports sectors.
Regarding direct suffrage the 35 voting assemblies of the previous year will be maintained. The polls will be open on September 14 from 09h to 21h.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 00:49:47</pubDate></item><item><title>IAO Hon | Owner denounces bad conditions of apartment</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/iao-hon-proprietaria-denuncia-mas-condicoes-de-apartamento/</link><description>Plaster falling from the ceiling and iron beams on display. This was the scenario described by an apartment owner in the Son Lei Building, one of the Iao Hon neighborhood buildings waiting for Macao Urban Renewal, whose beginning was scheduled for last year.
Speaking to the Macao Macao Forum Morning Program of Radio Macao, the resident, from a nickname Lai, revealed dissatisfaction with the delay of the authorities and asked to be announced as soon as possible the calendar for the reconstruction works of the building where he lives.
Another situation that concerns the resident is the delay in announcing the amount of income that will have to pay when moving to the temporary housing apartment, available to residents of IAO Hon buildings subject to urban renewal. It is recalled that the building where they will be temporarily housed will be in Lot P do Areia Preta, in the building built on the ground where the Pearl Horizon project was erected.
Not only does Lai not know the income of the temporary house, but he doesn't know when he will have to move. For now, the only concrete communication emerged in the form of an invitation to visit the temporary housing building fractions.
In April last year, the government of Ho IAT SENG assured that the reconstruction works of the Son Lei building would start in 2024.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 00:48:11</pubDate></item><item><title>IMF | Ara Stepanyan stopped leading office in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/fmi-ara-stepanyan-deixou-de-liderar-escritorio-em-macau/</link><description>Economist Ara Stepanyan will leave the office's leadership position in Macao from the International Monetary Fund after fulfilling a four -year term.

STD should “attract elderly visitors who like to travel by cruise to visit and consume in Macao”, not forgetting that the “Macao Monetary Authority has been encouraging the insurance sector to throw funds from pension and annuity products”, as well as asking the financial sector to “allocate sufficient funds to launch more innovative services and products intended for the elderly”.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 00:43:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Government identified 1000 jobs for residents</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/governo-identificou-1000-vagas-de-emprego-para-residentes/</link><description>The secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP, said yesterday that, in recent months, the governmentwork dedicated to finding jobs in the territory has identified 1000, related to 300 different positions. These vacancies are intended for residents seeking jobs.
“So far, more than 1000 job openings have been collected, involving 300 jobs, covering integrated tourism and leisure sectors, hotel, information technology, banking and financial services, aviation, social services, among others,” was referred to on the second day of plenary session to respond to oral interpeações of deputies. In this case, deputies Leong Sun Iok, Nick Law, Ngan Iek Hang and Ma Io Fong presented questions about the situation of residents' employment and unemployment.
This recent creation group also makes “directed training actions” and provides “assistance to Macao residents in access to employment, job change, horizontal mobility and professional rise”.
However, much of the debate was centered on the fact that residents work part -time with false contracts, or in poorly qualified work.
Deputy Leong Sun Iok even suggested the creation of a "minimum percentage for hiring places in casino companies, as they would have no opportunity to choose." Currently, according to reports received by the deputy, the companies “always arrange reasons not to hire places and there are situations of inequality, being the places hired in the short term because, in fact, the intention is to hire non-resident workers (TNR)”, with “cases of counterfeit” of contracts, he accused.
Nick Law also spoke of "testimonies of residents who say TNR work full time, seeming that residents only serve to occupy partial times." "Our young people want to work full -time in the offices, for example, and can't find work. Even in banks there are many TNR," he said.

From the government, Secretary Tai Kin IP said that it has been “strictly observed that the hiring of TNR serves only to supply the insufficiency of local human resources.

Wun Kong Law *
Kacee Ting Wong **
It is a widely recognized fact that the Macao game sector is under increasing pressure from the emergence of new game centers in neighboring regions. Even more worrying is the so -called “exclusion effect” caused by the excessive preponderance of the game industry, which makes it difficult to attract talent and the growth of game -related sectors, generating structural imbalances and obscuring the prospects of sustainable economic development. At this key transition moment, Macao must break decisively with the habit of rooted dependence over the years and adopt an innovation posture and initiative to promote moderate economic diversification.
This way is not just the right way to ensure robust long-term development, but it is an inevitable strategic choice for Macao to be proactively in the new competitive scenario. The strong commitment of the Government of the Special Administrative Region (MSAR) in the development of Mountain Island (Hengqin) and support for local entrepreneurs demonstrates that economic diversification has become one of the priorities of current governance.
For a long time, the high profits from the game sector generated, in some individuals and local companies, a dependence mindset, leading to a passive attitude of waiting for opportunities within the game's value chain, to the detriment of an active exploitation of new emerging sectors. This conservative mindset, resembling invisible currents, not only limits Macao's progress on the way to economic diversification and social innovation, but also weakens its ability to resistance to external shocks.
It deserves attention that certain companies remain too faithful to their traditional operational models, neglecting the formation of their innovation capacity and improving their adaptation to market dynamics. Once the external environment changes, they are severely affected, highlighting the urgency of transforming mental models and welcoming a culture of renewal.
Therefore, we argue that the commitment of business fabric in promoting economic diversification is as essential as - or even more pressing - the efforts of the government government to reduce the dependence of the game sector. Young local entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises should assume a central role, breaking with the mindset of comfort and becoming the driving force of industrial transformation and innovative development.
A paradigmatic example is that of Mr. Fu Tanglong, president of the Macao Digital Industry Research Institute and Executive Vice President of the Macao Living Transmission Association. Since the beginning of the Great Bay initiative in 2019, Mr. Fu has decided to launch himself inside China to undertake, moved by his confidence in electronic trade, actively exploring the economic opportunities provided by new technologies.
Through its training programs, it assisted more than 350 small and medium -sized companies in its digital conversion and provided training in digital marketing and in -moving transmission to about 4,000 young people. This practice demonstrates well the entrepreneurial spirit that combines the courage to explore the strategic vision with the use of comparative advantages. His success experience proves that, with proper professional training and taking advantage of Macao's unique geographical position and political environment, young people can open new horizons in electronic trade, developing personal careers and contributing to the region's economic transformation. In 2023 alone, the Mr. FU -led association helped Macao's local traders reach a sales volume of over $ 16 million (source: macaubusiness.com, December 10, 2024, “the entrepreneurship journey of a young man from Macao”).
Other inspiring examples of young entrepreneurs abound. Mrs. Huang Yin has been dedicated to the promotion and dissemination of traditional Chinese medicine in the territory; Mrs. Chan Nga Law, in turn, founded the company E.C. Film Production Company Limited, contributing in recent years to the development of the Macao film industry; And young talents like Leng Ka Chan and Oscar Chan Tianlan were elected in August 2024 by Macau Post as "great bay excellence entrepreneurs." These young entrepreneurs, actively exploring the unique cultural and historical resources of Macao and developing projects with strong local identity, prove the immense potential of innovation anchored in tradition. These success cases are inspired by companies to reinforce investment in research and development, valuing Macau's historical-cultural heritage and combining their traditional specificities with contemporary creativity, with a view to creating innovative products with macanese identity.
The active response of these individuals to the “Moderately Diversified Economic Development Plan 2024–2028” and the Government of the Government guidelines represents, in practice, the realization of the “four hopes” expressed by President XI Jinping in December 2024: to boost moderate diversification of the economy; Raise the effectiveness of governance of the special administrative region; Build opening platforms to the highest level outside; and safeguard social stability and harmony. Strategic attention attributed to the development of Mountain Island clearly reflects the prominent place that economic diversification occupies in the current governance. According to statistical data, the Guangdong-Macau in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin already hosts more than 56,000 commercial entities and more than 10,000 technological companies, constituting a fundamental pillar for Macao's economic transformation.
The new Government of MSA has attributes great importance to the expansion of economic and commercial relations with Portuguese -speaking countries, having foreseen, in its first year, an official mission to Portugal. Secretary for Economics and Finance, Mr. Tai Kin IP, recently stressed that the role of Macao as a bridge between China and Lusophone countries is irreplaceable. It also reiterated that the region will enhance its connection platform, with emphasis on the development of the technological industry as a strategic vector to achieve economic diversification (China Daily, June 27, 2025). It is also important to mark the growing role of macanese students in Portugal, who have become dynamic protagonists of the exchange between Chinese and Portuguese societies.
Promoting a renewal of mentalities requires the collective effort of all sectors of Macanese society and a coordinated advance on multiple fronts. Individual, Macao residents should cultivate a prospective view, break with conventional professional models and acquire emerging sectors specialized skills such as digital economy, creative industries or traditional Chinese medicine, continually reinforcing their competitive advantage. Companies, as protagonists of economic development, should abandon passivity, adopt a proactive posture of transformation, reinforce investments in technological innovation and product investigation, and strengthen cooperation with the interior of China and international markets. At the same time, they should seek to deepen their connections with the large bay and the outdoor markets, converting Macao's advantages as a platform into concrete business opportunities.
In fact, the private sector, for its efficiency, flexibility and competitive orientation, plays a particularly relevant role in the realization of economic diversification. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that many companies face the problem of high financing costs, which can limit their investment capacity - as has been widely discussed, including academic publications such as the Blue Sky Blog of Columbia University Law School. To respond to this difficulty, the Government of MSA has launched the “Young Entrepreneurship Support Plan”, offering interest-free loans to young people with entrepreneurial spirit but with limited resources, thus providing them with substantial support. This measure translates the governance view of paving the way to youth and reinforces the social consensus that young people should take advantage of this favorable conjuncture and get out of their “comfort zone”.
Most importantly, young people, who live this crucial moment of transition, must consciously assume the historical mission of leading Macao towards a model of sustainable and diverse economic development. Instead of questioning “what can Macau do for me?”, Should question “What can I do for Macau and my country?”, Cultivating an attitude of initiative and service, making national and regional prosperity its vocation.
The new generation should break free from the dependence on a single job in the game sector and widen their professional horizons, betting on continuous learning and improving their skills-not only as a requirement for personal development, but also as imperative to optimize the region's talent structure and promote social progress. From the national strategic point of view, the development of Hengqin will also contribute to the deep integration of Macao in the Great Bay. The firm and continuous application of President Xi Jinping's important guidelines will allow Macau to safely follow the right path traced by national policies towards a promising and predictable future.
As history teaches us, the periods of difficulty are also aptly moments for consensus consolidation and overcoming with determination. Macao is in a historic crossroads. Breaking with inertia, renewing concepts and redefining the course of development is not just urgent - it is unavoidable. In this context of transformation, we must all firmly support the policies of the Government of MSAR in the economic and social domains. Given the inevitable challenges of economic transition, the Macanese society must unite, strive with conviction in the process of diversification, and promote, with innovative spirit and social cohesion, the modernization of the productive structure.
If, as Dickens wrote, the worst times are also the best, then Macanese entrepreneurs should not lose confidence in the face of adversities, but will face them with courage and creativity, adopting innovative management models capable of responding to the challenges of economic transition and technological progress. Society as a whole should abandon immobilism, face changes with bravery and turn difficulties into opportunities. Only with the concerted action of individuals, companies and authorities will it be possible to take steady steps on the moderately diverse economic development, writing a new chapter in the history of Macao - a lasting prosperity chapter and sustainable progress.

** Lawyer, associate investigator at the Hong Kong Basic Law Studies Center and Macao at Shenzhen University, president of Think Tank “Chinese Dream” and deputy of the Hong Kong District Council</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 01:10:18</pubDate></item><item><title>The cracker that challenges repression</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/a-bolacha-que-desafia-a-repressao/</link><description>Hungary has recently banned LGBTQia+marches, further deepening its authoritarian and conservative drift under the government of Viktor Orbán. This decision is not only an attack on human rights - it is also a direct reflection of ignorance and fear in the face of diversity. In response, about 200,000 people took to the streets of Budapest to celebrate pride. Under the risk of being detained and even facing prison penalties up to a year, they were proudly fearless, convinced that they are on the right side of the story.
In this context, it is worth revisiting a simple but powerful didactic tool that has been used in schools and educational spaces for years to explain the complexity of human identity: GenderBread Person, a pun with gingerbread - the ginger ginger cookie.
The ginger person is a graphic representation that uses this figure of American popular culture - the head ginger cookie, trunk and limbs - to uncomplicate often misunderstood concepts: gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation and biological sex. Through this friendly figure, it is taught that these four dimensions are distinct but interconnected-and that, above all, do not fit rigid binarisms.
Unfortunately, for leaders like Orbán and for so many others in the world, this nuance is precisely what scares the most. In a world where human diversity becomes increasingly visible, the response of certain governments has been silencing and repression. They face him like a threat. Hungary, by banning the marches of LGBTQIA+pride, is not just denying public space to a vulnerable community - is denying its own social reality.
Genderbread explains things that should be simple: a person can be born with male biological characteristics, identify himself as a woman, express himself in a non-binary manner, and feel attraction to another man. It is a factual description of human complexity. In Hungary, in 2021 a law was passed that prohibits the “promotion” of LGBTQIA+ content with minors, in a clear attempt to associate gender identity and sexual orientation with taboo themes. The logic is old and spent: if we don't talk about, you may disappear. But LGBTQia+ people are not modern inventions - they are part of humanity forever. Denying their existence does not eliminate them; It only aggravates suffering, isolation and reinforces the urgency of resistance.
Europe has been watching, in recent years, a dangerous growth of populist movements that feed hatred and exclusion. Hungary is just an example of how this discourse can become state policy. Educating for diversity is the most effective antidote against extremism. Teaching children (and adults) that being different is not wrong, that the genre is not just about the binary man-man, and that love does not know rules imposed by ideologies-all this is a way to build more just and more human societies.
The fear that these leaders demonstrate is no more than refusing to accept the complexity of the human condition. Their ideological rigidity prevents them from recognizing that individual freedom and diversity are not threats-they are fundamental pillars of a healthy society. Today, more than ever, we need more ginger people in schools - and less stone leaders in the governments of this world.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 01:08:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Highly qualified investigator delivers food (I)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/investigador-altamente-qualificado-entrega-comida-i/</link><description>Recently, the online press has widely released the history of Chinese academic, Ding Yuanzhao (丁遠昭).
In 2004, Ding Yuanzhao got 700 points out of 750 in the admission exam to higher education in mainland China and joined Tsinghua University to take baccalaureate in chemical and bio-industrial engineering. After graduation, he was admitted to the University of Beijing and made his master's degree in Energy Resources Engineering. Later, he obtained his doctorate in biology at the Nanyang Technology University in Singapore. In 2018, he joined Oxford University in the United Kingdom to take a master's degree in biodiversity. Subsequently, he worked as a researcher in a postdoctoral degree at the National University of Singapore.
In March 2024, the contract as an investigator came to an end, was not renewed, and Ding started working as a food delivery in Singapore. It works 11 or 12 hours a day, and earns an average of $ 50 to $ 100 (about $ 40 to $ 80) and can earn up to 254 dollars of Singapore (about 200 US dollars) on Sundays.
This case caused a wide debate after Ding filmed and loaded a video on the internet. In the video, it showed the various academic certificates and advised candidates for joining the universities of mainland China, as follows:
"The results of the exams are not everything. Do not get pessimistic if they do not have good grades. The good results do not mean that they will have the future guaranteed. The works are not very different. Food deliveries is a good choice to serve society and to support, just work hard that we are rewarded."
In another video, Ding advises experts to pay attention to the safety of people who deliver food.
Ding's case caused a lighted discussion in Chinese society. The main reason is the disparity between its academic level and its current profession. This disparity draws attention to the problem of cultural conflict in Chinese society. Since the most remote times, China has always been focused on education. Cultured people can serve as members of the government and give wide to all their ambition. Another purpose of education is to cultivate the character, so there is a saying that says “training begins with learning and learning with reading.” (立身以立學為先 ， 立學以讀書為本)
In Europe, education focuses on the transmission of knowledge and encouraging students to think independently and innovatively. Universities are the bastion of knowledge and particularly value scientific research. Scientific research leads to innovation and innovation benefits society. This is the main objective of education, which has no relation to careers that many students choose after graduation.
Ding became a food delivery man after obtaining a doctorate. This disparity between formation and the current profession collides with the principles of traditional Chinese culture and it is inevitable that it has caused lit debates. This case is not only a story, but also a mirror that reflects issues such as the meaning of education, social values ​​and personal attitudes.
First, having passed a university researcher the food delivery, will Ding have questioned the usefulness of having obtained several academic degrees? Why go to the university? To answer this question, we cannot only consider personal experience, but a social perspective.
Knowledge is a personal property. It is not measured in terms of money, but in the evolution it causes in humans. Students receive education at the university to obtain more knowledge, to inherit an “intangible” property and enrich their spirits. The knowledge obtained at the University becomes professional knowledge, so professionals, such as doctors, lawyers and accountants, have to receive university education. After acquiring professional knowledge, the right way will be to embrace a profession where they give good use to the training they received. Only with talented and specialized people can social development exist, and only with talented and specialized researchers can new inventions emerge, which is also very necessary in all societies. Therefore, students who received university education should pursue careers other than those who have not received it and it is impossible for “future work to be not that different.”
Ding has a doctorate and is a person with a high degree of education. Working as a food delivery is obviously the result of a maladjustment between your formation and your current profession; This maladjustment results in the waste of talented people and society loses it. Ding's difficulty in finding a work compatible with his academic qualifications was a matter of lack of opportunities and was part of his life course. When in the future you find a work worthy of your background, you can again use your knowledge and learn to make them useful. Therefore, it is not correct to confuse the objective of education with the circumstances of life.

Socrates is a phenomenon of profitable ideas, lies, corruption, altruism and survival without financial problems.  Socrates began his activity in Covilhã as a technical agent. It presented the horrible projects of houses to build. Right then, he learned how they got a construction licenses on the road “faster. Earlier he joined the PSD by joining social democratic youth. Later, the political party with more representativeness in all that was going to have an elite position was the Socialist Party. And he joined as socialist militant. It was the secretary-general. He intended to treat him as an engineer, but it was quickly known that he had no engineering degree.
His party elected him secretary general and won elections. On the first day he entered São Bento as Prime Minister many of his friends interrogated how he had managed to go up to the third most important place in the Portuguese political hierarchy. During his government he had ideas of applauding, namely health reforms. He became one of the most popular politicians in the national political spectrum. But, there is always a "but". Socrates has always been an ambitious man and did not look at means to achieve the ends. And from the stage of chief executive began to be worth everything in what cambalachos played. The owner of this, Ricardo Salgado, immediately sent an employee of his, Manuel Pinho, to the government of Socrates. Manuel Pinho was Salgado's striker with the prime minister and it is known Ricardo Salgado “bought” Socrates about 30 million euros. As for the construction company Lena, whom no one knew, Prime Minister Socrates began directly awarded major works and, sources of the prosecutor, conveyed to us that in the process “Operation Marquis” it states that Lena made many million to Socrates. The Prime Minister traveled to Venezuela with the company Lena in the backpack and Hugo Chavez received very well the idea that Lena built thousands of social housing houses and a deep water port. Great contracts, large agreements, large counterparts. And once again, Socrates managed to reimburse large amounts, according to what is allegedly in the different processes.
One day Socrates left the country with his mouth open. Invited Muammar Gaddafi, president of Libya, to visit Portugal. Socrates intended libanese investments in Portugal and his guest, in exchange for very millions, managed to arm a giant tent inside the São Julião da Barra Fort, a national heritage that the Portuguese respects greatly. The people did not want to believe that there was a giant tent, with all the luxuries, so that Gaddafi would remain during the visit. What is known is that the Socrates-Gaddafi connection was immensely fruitful to the Portuguese politician. On the Socrates agenda could not miss Brazil and his friend Lula da Silva. A Brazilian journalist even wrote that the Portuguese Prime Minister was making a lot of money from Luso-Brazilian trade agreements. It was reached a height that the far-right leader Mario Machado announced that José Sócrates already had a fortune of US $ 330 million and that a cousin of his had gone to Macao depositing a local bank about 30 million euros.
The truth is that Socrates had a faustosa life with top of cars, better restaurants and funding to several women. He acquired a floor at one of the most valuable buildings of the Lisboeta Urbe with the Marquis of Pombal, hence the police and judicial intervention named “Operation Marquis” to the entire investigation to the life of Socrates. This one had also bought a lot of Alentejo for his ex-wife and to complete the signs of wealth traveled to Paris with his son and bought a house in the most expensive neighborhood of the French capital. The media of that time stressed that the presence of Socrates in Paris and the millions he spent was "a scandal." When he came to Portugal, he had the police at the airport waiting for him and was soon detained.
Judicial investigations already had evidence of their active and passive corruption, money laundering and intentional bank transfer by his friend Carlos Silva. Socrates entered the prison of Évora. He was known inside the prison as the 44. But, as Socrates knew a lot and had given a lot of money to earn his comrades, he watched a corruption of personalities on his way to Évora to embrace Socrates, including Mario Soares. He would later be released and began his judicial defense. He even responded several times to prosecutors. Which should not have suffered when the magistrates treated him for “Mr. Sousa”… The criminal accusations were many, however, Socrates surrounded themselves with good lawyers paid to the weight of gold and appeal, there are more than 10 years (it is unbelievable) without any judgment.
Socrates does not stop thinking a minute as it can all prescribe or leave as innocent. From there, last week gave a master blow. He traveled to Brussels and gave a press conference in which he announced that he was going to file a complaint against the Portuguese State at the European Court of Human Rights (TEDH). Socrates justified the reasons that led him to denounce the courts he said were "manipulated" to pursue him in "Operation Marquis."
He returns from Brussels and had the Campus of Justice in Lisbon, waiting for the first time to sit at the defendants' bank in a trial scheduled for last Thursday. A trial that will last months or years, where 15 defendants were present and Socrates defense lawyers require the annulment of the trial by alleged judicial irregularities. Well, Socrates either is Machiavellian or the smartest human on the planet. There are those who say they will be innocent and will still receive compensation from the state for the evil that has caused it to drag your case for over a decade. Now, say that the life of Socrates did not give a good movie…</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 05:38:00</pubDate></item><item><title>D´ As Guts | Maria João Pereira's discoveries in “My Body”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/das-entranhas-as-descobertas-de-maria-joao-pereira-em-my-body/</link><description>Tomorrow is inaugurated another exhibition of the theatrical project “D'S Endas”, which this time brings Macao images of Maria João Pereira taken in the pandemic years. In “My Body” there is a process of multiple discoveries by the photographed woman who built a new relationship with her body after this project
 
Covid's confinement years. A closed woman at home. A camera and the discovery of your own body. The new exhibition organized by the theatrical company “D'As Endas”, entitled “My Body”, features a set of photographs taken by Maria João Pereira during the pandemic. After publishing some on social networks, came the idea of ​​doing this project.
The inauguration takes place tomorrow at Creative Macau, from 18:30, and also brings a performance of the artist. This show consists of 42 works registered between 2019 and 2024 in a mobile chamber, “from multiple representations of the author's body in the private space of the house”.
According to a note “D'As As Guts”, “the set of photographs now presented expresses and interrogates the memory of the present time, mixing fiction and reality, in imagined narratives, through photography”, and can be seen until August 2.
The place of the body
At HM, Maria João Pereira reveals that doing these photographs constituted for himself "a small escape" in the years of confinement, having been a kind of "play with the body".
"I have some flexibility because of my school of theater, dance and acrobatic, and I tried to photograph images and unusual positions, more acrobatic so to say, to have the idea of ​​movement, explore the idea of ​​being alone and confinement, being closed and being able to play with what we have at hand," he explained.
It was not just about photographing the body, but "creating small scenarios and letting the audience explore everything through imagination, entering alternative realities."
Maria João Pereira belongs to the project “D'As Ascens” and this is the first time that exposes the images she has taken in those years. "I make a retrospective of all this work and the search for the language of the body. I was gradually made the images and did not do every day. What happened was that I had an image in my head, looked at the site and tried to reproduce with the body. When the idea arrived trying to photograph," he said.
For Maria João Pereira, this project has a lot to do with “inspiration” because “there are times when it comes and others”. "The confinement led me to the idea of ​​playing with the physical body, helped me the fact that I had some dexterity, and it was something that also allowed me to play. It ended up leading me to the discovery of the photographic body," he said.
Harmonious images
Maria João Pereira confesses that she was doing a "continuous discovery." "There is no [in this exhibition], an image that has been created before what happened [pandemic]. It is always a search for things that can be discovered, things they can work on. I have five more years in the face of age when I did these images, but that was not impeding to look the body in another way. It is a constant search," he said.
The artist leaves the message that the images that the public will see are not full -naked, much less “provocative or vulgar”. "When a person does this kind of work has to be prepared for the good and bad. But these are harmonious images, and even those in which I have clothes, I wanted to find diagonals in space and body, so it is not just a naked body," added the artist, confessing that before "My Body" did not like to be photographed.
“I undoubtedly created a new mindset about my body. I didn't photograph and hated it, until I found out that I liked to do it. It was a fantastic discovery that gave me a lot of imagination, being able to create lines and diagonal with the body. I created a new relationship with my body,” he said.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 00:59:52</pubDate></item><item><title>HK | Inaugurated first museum in Asia dedicated to Cristiano Ronaldo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/08/hk-inaugurado-primeiro-museu-na-asia-dedicado-a-cristiano-ronaldo/</link><description>The first museum in Asia dedicated to Cristiano Ronaldo was inaugurated this Monday in Hong Kong, in a space where it is possible to follow the career of Portuguese international footballer, from the origins, in Madeira, to the current stage, in Al-Nassr.

The July 5 prophecy departed from a Japanese comic book book by author Ryo Tatsuki, and contributed to several Asians to avoid traveling to the Japanese country. The prophecy became famous in Asia, given that Ryo Tatsuki had foreseen, in one of his previous 1999 works, a large catastrophe in Japan in 2011. This year he coincided with the earthquake of Tohoku, which killed 19,759 people, and gave rise to the tidal disaster of Fukushima Daiichi. The prophecy even led Japanese tourism authorities to react, to ensure the security of traveling in the country.
However, the impact was not limited to Japan, and the association's leader revealed that the demand for South Korea also suffered a reduction. Given the smallest demand, the domestic market adapted to offer more trips to the interior as a way to maintain recipes.
Wait a little longer
Speaking to the newspaper or Mun, Andy Wu explained that the impact of prophecy will last until the end of the month, because one of the interpretations points to the risk of a catastrophe lasts until July 31.
However, after this period, the leader of the Tourism Association expects a growth in the order of 30 percent.
Despite the optimism, Wu also explained that the Japan market will not be the main vacation destination for residents, as people currently prefer to travel to the interior of China.
Andy Wu explained that the destinations that are becoming more popular are Xinjiang, Yunnan and Gizhou. At the same time, the official, indicated that traditionally popular places, such as Mongolia do Interior and Guilin, remain very popular.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 23:55:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.
 
10/28/22
In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails about sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification as to their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a bastard touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstandings, if they are fortunately fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered a war, the best animals will be beheaded. superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lending to the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a "essence", therefore declared in the presumption of each one in the presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

According to the forecasts, Danas will pass through southern Zhejiang and then move through the neighboring provinces of Fujian and Jiangxi, throughout this Wednesday, gradually reducing their speed of the current 75 kilometers per hour (km/h) to 35 km/h.
In addition to the strong winds, the Chinese authorities have warned that some of the zones where the typhoon will pass may receive rainfall of up to 350 millimeters. This may result, according to China's meteorological administration, in flooding in mountainous and urban areas or in small and medium rivers to extravate the beds.
Several cities on the southeastern coast of China have announced prevention measures for the arrival of Danas, with Fujian authorities to also suspend several ferry routes that connect the continent to several islands.
Similarly, in Shanghai (east), located just over 300 kilometers north of the point where Danas is expected to touch Terra, the local government warned citizens to the possibility of strong gusts of wind and sudden rainfall.
Danas hit Taiwan at dawn on Sunday with winds of over 220 km/h, causing damage mainly in the southern part of the island and causing more than 5,000 incidents of diverse severity throughout the territory, where about 700,000 homes felt cuts in the supply of electricity.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 01:06:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Tianshui | Eight detainees after detection of lead in the blood of 233 children in daycare</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/tianshui-oito-detidos-apos-deteccao-de-chumbo-no-sangue-de-233-criancas-em-creche/</link><description>The authorities of the Chinese city of Tianshui, in the northwest of Gansu province, arrested eight people under an investigation into a case of lead poisoning, which affected 233 children from a private day care.

“Predictability and confidence,” said Ursula Von Der Leyen during a debate on the relations between the European Union (EU) and China at the European Parliament Plenary (PE) in Strasbourg, France.
The president of the community executive anticipated the summit between the political-economic bloc and a country that in five decades is no longer "a country of agriculture and today is an industrial colossus," and "one of the greatest global powers."
Last week, Ursula Von Der Leyen met with China's Foreign Minister in Brussels (Belgium), a city that houses the EU's main institutions, including the European Commission.
"We are two of the three largest economies and powers in the world […], but we only exchanged about two billion euros a day [with China]. Although the market is huge, our access is limited," he said.
The president of the European Commission has described a country that made “more than 800 million people out of poverty”, but which in the international geopolitical panorama has “real risks” to the EU, which are “strategic and systemic” and “harm the safety and competitiveness” of 27 community bloc countries.
"China has a completely different system from ours and tools at your disposal that allows you to" throw "the margin of the rules […], subsidies not only to assist its industries, but also to suffocate competition," said Ursula Von Der Leyen.

Demanding the rebalance of the economic balance between EU and Beijing, the “unambiguous condemnation” of the Russian invasion of Ukraine - which to this day has not done, although insisting that the sovereignty of all territories has to be respected - and containment in any “influence operations”, the president of the European Commission considered that the relationship between the two sides can only move, it is only “if it has to be“ rebalancing ”.

United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has announced that he should meet with the Chinese counterpart in the coming weeks to talk about issues such as trade between the two largest economies in the world.
"I will meet with my Chinese counterpart in the coming weeks," Bessent said in an interview with CNBC broadcaster on Monday. "We had good meetings in Geneva, London. We both approached the subjects with great respect," he added.
"I think there are things we can do together if the Chinese want to do it," said the American ruler. "Let's discuss whether we can go beyond trade and enter in other areas," he added.
Although Bessent did not identify the homologist by the name, the Treasury Secretary previously maintained negotiations with Chinese vice-minister He Lifeng, who headed the country's delegation for negotiations in London in June.
The China Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this year, the United States and China announced the imposition of customs rights that threatened to suffocate world trade and had strong repercussions on financial markets, which feared that a global recession.
Negotiations in Geneva and later in London led to the two countries to reach a truce agreement, as Beijing agreed to facilitate the export of rare land minerals, essential to a series of US industries, from the chip industry, clean energy and transport, in exchange for the survey of some of the restrictions imposed by the US. These minerals have assumed enormous importance in discussions between the two countries.
Tiktok and other stories
Last week, Bessent warned that the flows of critical materials had not yet returned to the levels recorded in April.
On the other hand, the framework of commercial negotiations between the United States and China is far from comprehensive and there are still complicated questions to resolve, including concerns manifested by US President Donald Trump about fentanyl trafficking, as well as efforts to ensure an agreement to alienate operations in the United States of Tiktok short-video application of Chinese capitals.
This agreement requires Beijing's signature, which gives the country a source of influence to potentially extract US concessions on trade and other issues.

International laws and order face “serious risks” in a global scenario marked by “unprecedented changes in more than a century” and a growing ineffectiveness of multilateral institutions, Li, China's representative in the 17th summit of group heads and government.
Faced with this context, the Chinese head of the Chinese government highlighted the “contemporary value” of the global vision proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping, absent for the first time from a BRICS summit.
"Given increasing conflicts and divergences, it is necessary to reinforce dialogue based on equality and mutual respect. And in the face of deeply intertwined common interests, it is necessary to seek joint contributions through solidarity," said Li.
The Chinese leader appealed to the Block of Emerging Economies to defend independence, demonstrate sense of responsibility and play a more active role in the construction of international consensus, underlining the importance of acting “based on morals and justice”.

"Many of these refugees have family members in India, so they are at home. The others are being housed in shelters," added Vanlalmawia.
Prior to this flow, the state of Mizram has welcomed about 30,000 refugees from Myanmar, who has been in civil war since the military returned to power in 2021.
India, which has been trying to strengthen ties with Myanmar's authorities to contain China's influence in the region, has never explicitly condemned the coup by the Burmese military in February 2021.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 22:53:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, Academic: “China is a reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended at the University of Aveiro the doctoral thesis that analyzes how China has been positioned in recent decades as an important actor in the “global health governance”. Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that to realize the will already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages ​​in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary general has ensured that he had “pleasing to work with all parties,” but stressed that this is a “decision that is up to central governments to make” and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, is not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new fund's new direction "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, if by case the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibility of rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo.

Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything that someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the appropriate place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macao, Camões has been poorly used in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>FIA | Conference helped perceive future of motorsport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/13/fia-conferencia-ajudou-a-perceber-futuro-do-automobilismo/</link><description>For the first time in its history, in 2025, Macau welcomed the Extraordinary General Assemblies and Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). Organized in partnership with the Macau-China General Association (AAMC), the FIA-affiliated sports territory, and Galaxy Entertainment Group, this event brought together more than five dozen FIA senior delegates from 147 countries in the field.
 
In the Galaxy International Convention Center, to this day, the future of motoring and mobility worldwide is discussed. However, some details about the future of sport in the territory have already been revealed between the lines. Focused on obtaining information about the growth of motorsport and promoting safe, sustainable and accessible mobility to everyone in the Asia Pacific region, the FIA ​​conference opening session highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration, as well as the region's ability to innovate and create solutions that respond to specific questions it faces.
Roberto Carlos Osório, president of the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), said the association has a strong tradition in motor racing and that following FIA's guidelines is being able to grow rapidly competition at the base level in the region.
“We organized the first GT Macau Cup in 2008,” said the AAMC leader. "Currently, we also have the GT Cup - Great Bay Race for GT4 cars. In addition, in 2008, we created Road Sport Challenge," he explained. “And today, in 2025, we are proud to announce that we have 68 tourism cars in the region to compete in the qualification race to enter the 72nd Macao Grand Prix.”
In a year when AAMC celebrates 30 years of existence - it was born as Macao Automobile Club - we also learned that the association's bet for the future will be in the basic disciplines of motor sport. Roberto Carlos Osorio also revealed a curious fact: Macau has 135 pilots with sports license from the territory.
“This growth was achieved following FIA's guidelines to promote grassroots motorsport and create accessible races for riders in the region,” added the manager of the territory. “With the interest of pilots, teams and promoters in developing state-of-the-art activities in Macau, we will focus even more on base competitions and affordable races, not only to support tourism, but also to make Macau in a Karting international center of international events, where champions can be selected for F4 and, later, for regional formula.”
Confirmed GP program
The Macao Grand Prix Organizing Committee (COGPM) held a press conference on June 8 at the Macao Grand Prix Museum to confirm the 72nd Macao Grand Program races, which will take place from November 13 to 16 this year.
As last year, there will be seven races in total, respectively, the Macao Grand Prix - FR da Fia World Cup, the GT Macau Cup - GT da Fia World Cup, the Macau Guide Race - Kumho Fia tcr World Tour Event of Macau, the Formula 4 Formula 4 World Cup, the 57th Macao Motor Motor Prize, GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge. For the first time, the guide circuit receives four different cups under the FIA ​​seal on the same weekend.
Other news
Between meetings and communications, other information was revealed about the November edition of the Macao Grand Prix. The FIA ​​World Council approved in Macao that the winner of the first Formula 4 World Cup of the FIA ​​will receive two points for the super license. We have also noticed that Pirelli will equip all the monologes that participate in both the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup and the FIA ​​regional formula World Formula Cup. In turn, the supply of tires and fuel to the FIA ​​GT World Cup remains in the contest phase.
Registration for the Formula 4 World Cup will be open until July 30. The final selection of 20 pilots will be confirmed by the FIA ​​through an official invitation letter, taking into account the current classification of the pilots in the respective championships.
In the case of the FIA ​​Regional Formula World Cup, registrations will also remain open until July 30, and the grill will be able to host a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula -equipped with alpha Romeo engines built by the autotechnic. As with Formula 4, participation will be by invitation, with priority assigned to pilots who have reached the best positions in the five regional formula championships of 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-13 18:43:57</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Jaguar that won in Macau in 1984 returned to the tracks</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/06/gp-jaguar-que-venceu-em-macau-em-1984-regressou-as-pistas/</link><description>The more than seventy years of history of the Macau Grand Prix are people, machines and great moments. We were in 1984, when Tom Walkinshaw won Jaguar's only victory in the guide race. After years away from the audience, for the affected man, this same car returned to the tracks at the hands of an enthusiast of the MSAR MOTOR EVENT
 
Richard Meins, an English maritime transport entrepreneur who lived many years in Hong Kong, who participated on several occasions at the Macao Grand Prix, led this Jaguar XJs of Group A in the Historic Touring Car Challenge race, a competition for classics during the Donington Historic Festival. This “Big Cat”, Chassis No. 5 and one of the four original XJs still existing, is practically as it was in 1984, but given the limitations of tobacco advertising, today boasts the colors used in the European Tourism Championship, instead of the iconic black and gold decoration of John Player Special (JPS) that marked the ticket through the guide circuit.
Interestingly, this return to the clues, from a car that has been still in New Zealand and Japan, was scheduled for the Algarve International Race Track, but the Historic Touring Car Challenge canceled its race in early April in Portimão. So it was in lands of his majesty that Richard Meins made his first race with the British car.
“The car won in Macao in 1984, so I'm a big fan of this model,” Ricard Meins told the English magazine Motorsport News. “I still have the photographs I took this weekend in Macao,” recalled this avid classic competition car collector who, besides driving, supported several riders at the Macao Grand Prix.
In Donington Park, Richard Meins shared the imposing Jaguar XJS, equipped with a 5.3 -liter V12 engine with Jack Tetley, and ended in sixth place, winning in his class. Richard Meins had only guided the car once or twice, but plans to participate in more historic touring car challenge rounds with XJS 1984. “Let's try to put it on track more often now,” Ricard Meins said, who revealed that he was a stake in the Silverstone Festival in August with this very rare and striking copy of the 1980s tourism cars history.
Premiere of an iconic decoration
In the summer of 1984, Tom Walkinshaw accepted the challenge of the Portuguese organization of the Grand Prix to travel later this year to Macau. With the European title in his pocket, the English driver and team boss was accompanied by one of his usual riders, German Hans Heyer. The guide race was a BMW fiefdom and the controversial English wanted to put an end to the Bavarian domain in the race. To this end, it had the precious support of JPS, which was relaunching the brand, decorating its cars with the famous black and gold colors that would later be eternalized in Ayrton Senna's Lotus. At the time, the guide race took place three weeks before 1000 km from Bathurst, another important race on the worldwide calendar of tourist racing, and so TWR made a "two in one."
The 100 -mile race on the streets of Macao would not have much history, such as the cars built in the Kidlington workshops against the competition headed by the two BMW 635i Schnitzer officers, guided by Hans Stuck and Dieter Quester, and painted by rival Marlboro. Tom Walkinshaw ended first and Hans Heyer and m second.
At the end of the race, quoted by the Portuguese newspaper Autosport, Tom Walkinshaw said: “The circuit is fantastic. Tight, but with many curves, climbs and descents, which made the race become difficult. But I like difficult things and, for me, the race was great from beginning to end.
The Jaguar were again invited by the Macao Grand Prix committee to run in 1985, but Tom Walkinshaw had other plans for his cars. Fortunately, thanks to Richard Meins we will continue to see this beautiful car on the tracks.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>TCR China | André Couto participated in the Zhejiang race</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/tcr-china-andre-couto-participou-na-prova-de-zhejiang/</link><description>Over the weekend, André Couto had an unexpected return to the TCR China Championship, in what was his first race of this season. The rider of the sgas showed that "who knows, never forgets", despite having had a troubled passage through the Zhejiang International Circuit
The Portuguese pilot residing in Macao, who has not competed since November last year-when he played the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals, having won the title in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia Pro-AM category-received a last-minute invitation from MacPro Racing Team to conduct one of the Honda Civic Fl5 TCR Team in the third race of the Chinese Championship. TCR.
Without any prior training, André Couto came back to sit in a car he already knew, also with a technical structure that was familiar to him. By 2023, the territory pilot had already played some TCR China events with this set, then at the service of the official team Dongfeng Honda Racing Team, showing a progress right from the beginning.
"Free training did not go wrong, but in qualification a less attentive pilot hit me on my first departure lap to the track. He hit me from behind and did not realize why. Damaged me the rear, dislocated the convergence and the car was crooked. Hm. "Still, I qualified myself in fourth in Q1, five tenths of the first, which, with the car in the conditions it was, was not bad. The car had potential."
In Q2, due to the damage, the Japanese car “became much harder to guide” and Couto ended in tenth. However, this ended up having a positive effect: “With the reversal of the starting grid, the tenth place of Q2 allowed me to start first to the second race.”
The first race, played on Saturday on the shaoxing track, did not go as well as the pilot wanted, not being able to follow the official links, nor the best Honda and Hyundai. "I ended up eighth. The car was not as good as expected and we found that there was a damaged damper, still from the crash in the qualification, which was exchanged for the Sunday race."
Inglorius Sunday
In the 20 Sunday round race, André Couto had everything to shine as he departed from pole-position and Honda finally seemed in a position to fight for the first places. "On the way back, the car was good. I didn't feel strange anymore and I was optimistic."
The idea was to get well to distance themselves from the fastest competitors in the first laps and then manage the race with new tires. However, it all faded quickly when it was wrapped by Wu Yi Fan right in the brake for the first curve.
“That was my mission, but I couldn't,” acknowledged the winner of the 2000 Macao Grand Prix. “He hit me on the first curve and the car was damaged. Sports commissioners, but that does not change the fact that I have given up. ”
With Honda's damaged direction, André Couto had no choice but to leave. "I was a bit disappointed because I hope to get a good result for MacPro Racing Team that had given me a good car.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:26:00</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA AFINA REGIONAL Formula Rules</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/gp-fia-afina-regras-da-formula-regional/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) took advantage of the Macao Extraordinary Assemblies in Macao and its annual conference to publish the Macao Grand Prix Regulation - FIA Regional Formula Cup of 2025. There are not many changes compared to 2024, but the introduced changes aim to browse gaps from the first edition of this macau.
The twelve red flags during last year's qualification session called for the level of pilots at the Guide Circuit, which was the premiere of the FIA ​​regional formula in Macau regional formula. This happened after the controversial decision of the FIA ​​to consider that Formula 3 was no longer adequate to the Macao Citadino layout.
Unsurprisingly, the sports regulation is now clear that, to compete in the FIA ​​regional formula world, “all pilots must have participated at least 3 competitions with a monolugar that has been projected and/or built to achieve a weight/power ratio of more than 3.0 kg/hp.”
Emanuele Pirro, a former F1 pilot, winner of the Guide Race and president of the FIA ​​monoligai committee, said during the weekend of the 71st edition that, in the future, the FIA ​​will be more demanding about track discipline. Thus, from now on, “any pilot who, in the opinion of sports commissioners, is solely responsible for the display of a red flag during the qualification training session, will not be able to continue to participate in this session and its best time back can be annulled.” The new regulation also states that “if a qualification training session is interrupted with less than four minutes remaining, it will not be restarted.”
On the other hand, the FIA ​​maintains the limit in the participation of more experienced pilots, except only “pilots who participated in a maximum of 3 FI F2 Championship competitions of 2025.” This measure goes a little against the spirit and history of the Great Prize, which has always gathered pilots from higher categories in its main race. In fact, this was a fervent question between Macao and the International Federation on two previous occasions.
In 1985, Alfredo César Torres, then responsible for Portuguese motorsport, convinced Jean-Marie Balestre, against his will, to allow the participation of F1 pilots in the F3 Intercontinental Cup in the name of the economic viability of the race. In 2016, the controversy returned with the veto da FIA to the participation of Nelsinho Piquet, a decision badly received by the teams and then coordinator Barry Bland, which would eventually abandon the co-organization of the race a year later.
Bet on continuity
In sports terms, registrations for this second edition of the FIA ​​regional formula Cup will remain open until July 30. The grill may include a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula monologues, all equipped with Alfa Romeo engines built by the Italian Autotechnic. Pirelli will once again be the official tire supplier.
The identities of the invited teams have not yet been revealed, but some news is expected in this field compared to 2024. To avoid any behind -the -scenes disputes, it has already been defined that “the position on the boxes for the teams that participate in the Macao Grand Prix will be based on the ranking of the previous year” and, in turn, “the position on the roads to new teams will be attributed based on the order of the application.”
Equal awards and more restricted advertising
The values ​​of monetary awards remain unchanged this year, with a total of US $ 68,500 to distribute, the equivalent of just over 550,000 patacas at the current exchange rate. The race winner will receive $ 12,000, an amount that is still far from covering the costs of participation in this nature.
On the other hand, the sports regulation introduces two new prohibitions on advertising into the monoligales. In addition to the existing prohibition of advertising to fortune or bad luck, tobacco or pornography, also the promotion of electronic cigarettes and alcoholic beverages - a measure that follows the legislation in force in the territory.
The 72nd Macao Grand Prix, the largest international sports event of the MSA, will take place between November 13 and 16, 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 03:31:16</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Project for new track in Zhuhai emerges</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/automobilismo-surge-projecto-para-nova-pista-em-zhuhai/</link><description>With a very black cloud to turn to the future of the Zhuhai International Circuit, there is a potential good news for the great bay of motoring: a project for a new permanent circuit in the Chinese city adjacent to the MSAR.
According to Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper, Guangdong's provincial government recently published the document “Measures to promote high quality tourism and accelerate the construction of a strong tourist province”, which proposes, for the first time, the creation of an “industrial circle of culture and tourism of the Great Bay”, offering political support to the integrated development of culture and tourism in the region. With this, the first industrial and tourist complex of motorized sports in the Great Bay may emerge.
The project of the Zhuhai Chaoyue international circuit was recently presented at the Zhuhai Ocean Spring Resort, located in Doumen, not far from the city's airport, with an initial investment of 250 million Renminbis.
According to the first information, the project of this circuit provides for welcoming evidence such as Formula 3 and foster collaborative development between motorized sports sectors, cultural events and exhibition industry. The plan includes the holding of several international tests per year and foresees collaboration with Hong Kong and Macau to connect cities such as Jiangmen and Zhongshan, promoting “Multiple stops” and boosting the innovative development of “Event Economics + Cultural Tourism”.
According to Zhou Jian, China Travel Service (Zhuhai) Executive Director General Ocean Spring Resort Co., the FIA ​​grade certification-will also include a karting track, drift track and an interior space of 2,400 m² for exhibitions and events related to the automobile sector. With more than 50 international events projected annually, the goal is to become a "super IP" that joins running, leisure and tourism under the same concept.
The first phase of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit project will include international certification professionals, as well as support facilities. This project aims not only to fill “a gap in the high -end motorized sports sector in Zhuhai, but will also promote the modernization of the Great Bay's cultural, sports and tourist industries by conducting international racing and themed cultural events linked to motorsport.”
Uncertainties in the air
Last summer, the company Malay LBS Bina Group BHD announced that it sold its participation in the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) - the first permanent circuit built in the interior of China - by 124.7 million ringits (about 214.15 million patacas). In a statement to Bursa Malaysia Securities BHD, the group reported that their subsidiary, Dragon Hill Corporation Ltd, sold all his participation in Lamdeal Investments Ltd (Lil) to Huafa Urban Operation (HK) Ltd, a well -known real estate operator. Lil Detinha 60 percent of Zhuhai International Circuit Limited (ZICL), circuit operator.
Raised in 1996 in order to receive the first major award from China from Formula 1 - something that never materialized - ZIC was still the initial motor of motoring in the country and a reference in Asian motorsport. Since its opening, it has welcomed several international evidence, such as the FIA ​​GT, A1 GP or the Intercontinental Le Mans Series. In recent years, track administration has chosen to organize its own events, abdicating the most costly international evidence.
Despite having received, in the past, auto competitions from MSAR, ZIC has been losing protagonism in local motorized sport, due to high prices, limited availability and reducing sports activity in favor of the most profitable commercial activities. The future of the circuit remains uncertain: it is only known that lease agreements between resident teams and the circuit have been frozen and are not being renewed. The track approval will also be about to expire, requiring a new certification to continue to receive competitions in the future.
However, on the weekend of June 14 and 15, the still only circuit of Zhuhai will host the third race of the Formula 4 China Championship season.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 01:53:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao's historicals get a GP clearance</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/historicos-de-macau-conseguem-apuramento-para-gp/</link><description>The Guangdong International Circuit welcomed, last weekend, the second and decisive double journey of Macao - Macau Road Sport Challenge cars, proof of finding for the most important motor racing of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. In a journey with few celebration reasons for the colors of the sinters, the veterans Jerónimo Badaraco and Rui Valente managed to ensure the qualification.
With a list of 68 subscribers, the grill was divided into two groups, A and B, with all the pilots competing with Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8) models. This year, with only one race scheduled for the Grand Prix Program - due to the inclusion of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup - the number of riders was reduced to 36, which placed a supplementary pressure for both missing races. To complicate, the rain came, changing the turns to teams and riders.
In Group A, where Rui Valente faced a complicated weekend on the track around Zhaoqing, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão failed to qualify, in a series dominated by Hong Kong pilots. In Saturday's race, the podium consisted of Wong Chuck Pan, Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping. On Sunday, these three repeated the feat, but with a new order: Lo Pak Yu, Chan Ka Ping and Wong Chuck Pan.
In difficult atmospheric conditions on Saturday, Rui Valente ended only 25th, due to an error in tuning, improving to 15th on Sunday, with the track dry. A penalty after the second race fired him to the 27th place. Still, the 7th place obtained on the first round was enough to secure a place in the Macao Grand Prix.
