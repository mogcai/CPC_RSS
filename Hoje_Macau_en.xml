The Hong Kong Observatory launched a 2025 forecast on Tuesday that points to higher temperatures due to the continuous impact of climate change. The entity that monitors the weather and climatic phenomena in the neighboring city, and is usually in line with Macao's weather and geophysical services, estimates that this year enter within 500 kilometers from the city to eight tropical cyclones, starting in June or even before.
The meteorology agency also stated that Hong Kong will be affected by storms and strong and localized rain, although it predicts that annual precipitation is located within normal values.

DSEDJ will launch guidelines for next school year on the heights and circumstances in which students can use their mobile phone
 
The government will launch a set of guidelines on the use of mobile phones for students of non -higher education schools in the territory, which will take effect from the next school year. The measure was revealed yesterday by the head of the Secondary Education Division of the Directorate of Education and Youth Development Services (DESDJ), Leong I on, during the Macao Forum Program of the Chinese channel of Radio Macau.
The official indicated that the guidelines will serve as a management guide, and a starting point for schools and parents to reach consensus, indicating the circumstances in which students can use their mobile phones, but limiting their use during classes and even intervals.
To help schools move to the new reality, DSEDJ is committed to supporting schools to buy cabinets to store the appliances.
In the same program, the head of DESDJ Curriculum Development and Evaluation Division, Cheang Sek Kit, recalled that the government spread among the schools in the territory instructions that should be included in the teaching system on good internet use. These instructions indicate that adequate and healthy use of the Internet by a young man should not exceed a daily average of one hour, with intervals of 20 in 20 minutes.
The screen pacifier
On the other hand, a representative of the social services of the Sheng Kung Hui (Macau) charity association has release to the public broadcaster microphones that internet addiction affects ever younger youths. Ho Ka Hong, social worker at the Anglican Church, linked the need to reinforce cyber literacy in schools and promote good use of technology among the young.
"Our organization mostly accompanies young people aged 10 to 24 years addicted to the Internet. However, we have already received requests for help from parents due to excessive internet use by children aged between six and eight years," said the social worker.
Ho Ka Hong recalled that in 2022, Sheng Kung Hui performed an inquiry into literacy on the Internet that it showed, unsurprisingly, that the mental state of young people deteriorates the time they spend online, with particular incidence for the use of social networks. "Young people are always aware of the notifications of their social networks, which can influence their emotions and cause anxiety," added the social worker.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 01:53:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Restoration | Chan Chak Mo asks for more support to the government</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/restauracao-chan-chak-mo-pede-mais-apoios-ao-governo/</link><description>President Associations of Macao Restoration and Beverages owners acknowledged that there is a widespread environment of “lack of belief” in the future and that trade war between the US and China can further aggravate the situation
 
Deputy and President Associations of the owners of Macao Restoration and Beverages establishments, Chan Chak Mo, defends the increase in government support to restaurants and local commerce. The statements were made to the Chinese Language Social Communication bodies, in the possession of the new social bodies of the Association.
According to Chan's explanations, restaurant owners are very concerned about the changes in consumer standards and the purchasing power of visitors. The deputy explained that although the number of visitors has increased in February and March, compared to the same period, that many restaurants are not feeling the benefits of this increase.
The most recent months were even characterized as periods with “suffering” revenues, which Chan said they contributed to aggravate the complicated situation of the restoration.
This scenario is added a lunar New Year with a very different impact, and not always according to expectations. According to the businessman, the restaurants with the large casinos benefited from the high time of tourism. However, the impact on other restaurants has been variable, and in many cases below expectations.
For this reason, Chan Chak Mom appealed to the government to launch new support measures, such as the consumer carnival, which begins next week, but also the effective revitalization of the old neighborhoods, greater facilities in issuing licenses to new restaurants and the creation of more tourism events, to bring visitors to community neighborhoods.
Recipes to go down
At the level of his restoration business, Chan Chak Mock acknowledged that even restaurants in the city's most touristy areas are suffering, with recipes presenting 10 to 20 percent.
When he tried to explain these changes, Chan indicated the breach of confidence in the economy of visitors, the environment of economic uncertainty inside and the reduction of the number of visitors in the Lunar New Year.
Faced with all changes, the President Associations of the owners of Macao Restoration and Beverages Establishments also admitted that the sector crosses a phase of “lack of belief” generalized.
In this context, and given the possibility of a trade war between the United States and China, Chan argued that the government should adopt more restoration support measures, such as distribution of consumer coupons and carrying out activities in community neighborhoods to attract tourists.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 01:47:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Health | Sam Hou Fai says that hospital of the islands will have “international influence”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/saude-sam-hou-fai-diz-que-hospital-das-ilhas-tera-influencia-internacional/</link><description>A “first class” medical center and with “international influence”. This was the promise of Sam Hou Fai for the future of Hospital das Ilhas. The government leader also stated that the executive is working so that residents can treat serious illnesses in Macau, instead of seeking treatment abroad
 
The chief executive said that the islands hospital, explored by the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, will reach "international influence." The statements appear in the official statement of a meeting, at the closed door, with the honorary president of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (Pumch) and president of the Chinese Association of Medicine Professionals, Zhao Yupei.
During the meeting, which was communicated on Tuesday night, Sam Hou Fai stated that “with joint effort” the government and the national institution “will definitely be able to create a first-class medical center with international influence, contributing to develop the sector of 'Health + Tourism' and enriching the comprehensive health industry”.
The Islands Hospital is the executive's bet to develop Macau as a health tourism center, with the exploitation of space, built with public capitals, was attributed to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. This bet is also viewed by Sam Hou Fai, and its predecessor Ho Iat Seng, as the way to reach the diversification of the economy of the territory.
Currently, the islands Hospital is managed as a private institution, so residents have to pay the price of use. The exception is only verified when residents are referred by health services to the institution, accessing medical care under public service conditions.
Stay in Macau
Among the statements cited in the official statement, Sam Hou Fai also pointed out the islands hospital as hope for residents to stop leaving Macao to treat more serious illnesses. The government leader said that "to achieve the goal of" treating serious diseases without leaving Macao, the Macao Medical Center gradually expands its external consultation services, which clearly demonstrates the determination of the government of MSAR in widening health coverage and optimizing the distribution of medical resources. "
The statements arise after the recent opening of external consultations specializing to non-residents of Macao, such as workers, students and others with special fixation authorizations.
However, the objective is to widen the service to health tourists. In this respect, the ruler indicated that the opening of external consultations "not only provides a convenient option to non-residents of Macao, but also increases the attractiveness for the residents of the Great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay and Southeast Asia countries."
During the meeting was also signed the agreement on the “Operational Cooperation Rate 2025 of the Island Health Care Complex - Macao Medical Center of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital”. However, the content of the document was not revealed, nor the eventual payment by the government to the institution of the interior of China.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 01:45:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Aviation | Maria José de Freitas regrets removal of panels from the airport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/aviacao-maria-jose-de-freitas-lamenta-retirada-de-paineis-do-aeroporto/</link><description>The first attempts to establish in Macao airlines in the early twentieth century were approached by historian Célia Reis in the “Spring Conferences” of the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center. The architect Maria José de Freitas regretted the removal of panels from Macao International Airport that told this same story
 
Between the departure of the plane and the entrance to Macao International Airport (AIM) was a corridor that told the history of civil and military aviation from the territory of the early twentieth century. The project of this area of ​​the airport is by the studio of architect Maria José de Freitas, which regrets the removal of the panels and historical information that were installed in 2013.
The architect left this idea in an intervention after the presentation of historian Célia Reis about the history of civil and military aviation in Macao on Monday, on the occasion of the “Spring Conferences” that take place at the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in Lisbon.
“We decided to tell the story of Aviation in Macao in this corridor, with a great extent, although at the time there was little documentation about it. I discovered some information in a work by Luís Andrade de Sá. We collected texts and images and put it all on the walls of this corridor, and that was there for a while.”
"With a new direction [at AIM], I was asked how I could prove that all these events had happened. I had documentation in Portuguese, but I had nothing in Chinese and English, and at a time when I moved to Portugal on vacation, I saw, when I returned to Macau, who had removed all the information and images from this corridor. This story is unfortunate," he added.
The architect added that she would like the history of the early days of Aviation in Macao to be told in these same walls. "It would be important to realize where there is more information, so that they realize the history of aviation in Macao, which was a pioneer. There was, for example, an aviation hangar near the mud houses, and there are a series of references linked to the history of this land that should be made visible at the airport, in the rooms, for example. This story should be told and things should be placed in the right place," he said.
Ricou plans
Célia Reis, historian and teacher, is developing an investigation project around the early days of aviation in Macao and this was the theme that led to the “spring conferences” on Monday, with the session “Aviation and Air Navigation in Macao in the 1920s-a process of colonial innovation”.
Célia Reis spoke of a time when aviation began to be important to China for security reasons, and also begins to be thought to Macau. In this process, there is a personality whose name is important, a Hong Kong -born Frenchman: Charles William Ricou, a engineering and aviation pilot. From November 1919 the possibility of “establishing an air career between Macao, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Philippines, Java, India” began to equate, from November 1919, the possibility of Macaoi, Shanghai, Java, India, "contacting local government entities to obtain facilities and agreements.
Célia Reis explained that Ricou intended to form two airlines, the “Far East Aviation Company”, with “a much wider connection, reaching Manila”, and another to connect Macau, Hong Kong and Cantão, named “Macau Aerial Transport Company”.
This company "was constituted in Hong Kong, with a capital of $ 50,000, and had as founding partners personalities from Macau, such as Humberto de Avelar, Rodrigues dos Santos, Francisco Nolasco and Francisco da Silva". The historian also said in the presentation that the idea "was to complete the rest of the capital necessary with low value actions so that they could be bought by all [the inhabitants] in Macao."
"There is even the appeal of the company's board of directors for the Macanese to subscribe to capital, showing that the company was extremely important for the inhabitants of Macao, highlighting its patriotic value, of solidarity with progress," he added.
"Several voices demonstrated at that time that the company's commercial success, at first, could be little or none, although it was thought that the company could have some profits, having the ability to transport the air mail. However, this transportation capacity would be extremely limited, as the number of mail objects to transport from Macau was 24 letters a day," said Célia Reis.
At the time it was thought that Macau would be a pioneer, because "it would be the first territory to the East to have an aviation company", something that would "bring more visitors and increase trade." The Government of Macao, then led by Governor Correia da Silva, "gives in to the company's appeals, granting various facilities, such as the permission to build a provisional hangar on public ground that was vacant or from sea access infrastructure." In addition, “exemption from payment of the fuel storage tax” was allowed.
Thus, Macao even had hydroavião and 21 American airmen hired by the company. "It was considered that it was the largest load of air material exported by the United States of America (USA), all brought to Macao." Then the company tries to organize itself, "even asking for space on Taipa Island, designed to have definitive hangars, although provisional concessions have existed." In this context, he recalled the historian, "there were subsidies, a contract for the transportation of postal bags", to "allow a development of air navigation."
Impasses to the end
In May 1920, a new worldwide aviation convention emerged, to which Portugal adheres, which causes the “Macau Aerial Transport Company” to be nationalized. The project comes to advance, but quickly retreats.
“The airline therefore accesses the condition of obtaining a subsidy, and having four aircraft available for military service in Macau, if necessary. The issue of defense was always present. There was then some disagreement between the conditions required by the company and those that the governor understood were necessary. In addition, the government of Macao needed the Lisbon authorization for the operation of the airline. Advance, and this one begins to negotiate with the company. But voices begin to emerge in Lisbon that will make things change. ”
This is the idea that the US would be showing hidden interests through the establishment of the company. "[In Lisbon] it is fear that this is the found form of an American aviation company to settle in Macao, Portuguese territory, by different ways."
First, Lisbon forbids, retreating in the negotiations, and the next governor, Rodrigo Rodrigues, "is not in accordance with the company, understanding that it will not be viable," which leads to the entire project and dialogue to be suspended.
Célia Reis also pointed out that "the government of Correia da Silva has undergone several difficulties in these years, in terms of security", having occurred "very serious incidents in the relationship between Portugal and China".
“For this reason, the governor considered that having airplanes was extremely important because, at this moment, China was also resorting to aviation. The authorities of Portugal, however, considered that the planes of Macao would be of no importance, comparing with the set of aircraft that would have China or even Japan. When permission for the constitution of the airline in Macao, Lisbon understands that the territory could have in a worrying situation and planes could have functions with planes Military, even if there were few, ”explained the historian. The project would fall, however, by land.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 01:43:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Espionage | Chinese investigator sentenced to death</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/espionagem-investigador-chines-condenado-a-morte/</link><description>An employee of a Chinese investigation institute was sentenced to the death penalty for selling confidential information to a foreign information agency, China officials said yesterday.

South Korean authorities announced the plan yesterday, in an effort to avoid mass protests and possible attacks on important facilities, including the court, in the midst of the current climate of political tension in the country.
The plan includes the mobilization of 14,000 shock police in Seoul, representing 60 percent of the disorder control forces available in the country, according to the Yonhap public news agency.
The exact date of the hearing has not yet been released, but it is expected to happen before the end of March. The Constitutional Court concluded at the end of February the analysis of Yoon's dismissal process, due to the imposition of the statement of martial law on December 3.
Personal safety units, detectives and special forces will be mobilized around the court, and antiDronist equipment will also be mobilized to prevent illegal flights on the area, which was declared air exclusion zone last week. Authorities have warned that any attempted invasion of the court will result in immediate arrests.

Almerindo Fernandes, 30, has a degree in Civil Engineering and for years has worked on rural road construction projects, but the 'animal' for agriculture spoke louder and today owns Timor-Leste's first 'smart farm'.
In Lautém, Almerindo Fernandes has about two hectares of terrain, where he planted eggplant, tomatoes and other vegetables, which watering through an intelligent irrigation system that controls through a platform on his mobile phone.
"It means that in Portugal or England we can water the garden with the mobile phone. It's the modern world, the world of technology, digitization. It's the opportunity to use technology, using the mobile phone to water my garden," he told Lusa. "It is a great opportunity to use technology to modernize agricultural productions," he said.
With about 1.3 million inhabitants, the agricultural sector in Timor-Leste is vital to the economy of the country, but production is low and did not follow the growth of the population. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, more than 70% of the Timorese population lives in rural areas and most practice subsistence agriculture.
Almerindo Fernandes started the activity in 2017 with the money he was sparing while working as a civil engineer and today sells his production to the school lunch program, the Armed Forces and the markets of his municipality. “So far it was a private activity, but the government is supporting the expansion of the project to the other municipalities of the country,” explained Almerindo Fernandes.
The support was achieved after presenting the project to the vice-prime minister, coordinating minister of social affairs and Minister of Rural Development and Community Housing, Mariano Assanami Sabino, who eventually hired him as a specialized technician to bring the concept to the rest of the country.
“The government recognizes the creativity of young people and all citizens who have creative initiatives. It is a great opportunity and the government is supporting the transformation of the garden into a youth formation center,” explained Almerindo Fernandes.
In the garden, Almerindo Fernandes already has to work four people permanent and then hire others to plant, take the vegetables and do the maintenance, and at the same time gives training to young people who study agriculture.
Now, according to the civil engineer, the garden also serves to do experiences to improve the system, that is, to make it more efficient and effective, with “little spent and greater performance”. "It is the principle of modernization, increased production, minimal cost is the purpose of the intelligent garden system and it is a theory we have to adapt to Timor to develop the country," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 01:19:38</pubDate></item><item><title>IC | Launched book on the historical roots of Rua das Estlagês</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/14/ic-lancado-livro-sobre-as-raizes-historicas-da-rua-das-estalagens/</link><description>“In Search of Its Roots - An Illustrated History of Street of Estalagins” is the name of the work Bilingual, launched in digital format, which tells the story of this historic street of Macao, revealing the business that survived the passage of time. Production was in charge of the Macao Artists Society, with the support of the Cultural Institute and Sands China
 
The history serpes through the stalage street since the end of the nineteenth century. The narrow artery has always been the scene of an intense social and commercial rebolement and it was where Sun Yat-Sen, considered the father of modern China and the Republican Revolution, opened pharmacies and drugstores, especially from 1893. Over the years, Rua das Estalagem, in Porto, was a living example of commerce, and the Portuguese governors were progressively expanding the street, composed of the street Chinese -style buildings and temples, such as the Temple of the Bazaar and Goddess Temple NOVA WO.
All these pieces of history are now counting on the digital publication “In Search of Its Roots - An Illustrated History of Rua das Estlagês”, a work produced by the Society of Macao Artists and authored by Siguo Chen in Shirley Lule's texts and illustrations. Those responsible for the edition are the Cultural Institute (IC) and the game operator Sands China.
According to a press release of Sands China, the book, in Chinese and English, intends to “highlight the fascinating past of the historic Macau Street and the beauty of its legacy”, containing interviews with street -related figures, whether merchants or residents. Thus, it is intended to bring “residents and visitors to rediscover the preciousness of the centenary stores and the cultural heritage of the street through legendary stories” so that they can “widen their understanding of the transformation of the neighborhood and its inhabitants”.
The content of the book results from “close conversations with representatives of associations, business entities and residents of the neighborhood,” having dozens of oral stories that can easily be lost if not recorded. This work is not closed in the digital world, having been printed to appear in the public libraries of Macao and schools, in order to “promote the meaning of cultural heritage and enhance mutual ties among the people of Macao”, intending to be “a valuable community resource to deepen the understanding and appreciation of Macao and the street”.
200 years of history
One of the highlights given in the book is to the textile sector that has always predominated on Rua das Estlagenas. In the chapter entitled "Two Centuries of Prosperity: Spinning A Legacy in the Textiles Trade" [two centuries of prosperity: the construction of a legacy in the textile trade], it is read that "Street of Estlagins has always been a center for the textile industry." In the years when the textile sector had a larger presence in the territory, between the 70's and 90's, "Rua housed more than 20 stores with factory products, including three spaces from the Veng On Farm Store." “Around 30 businesses related to these stores, such as tailors, clothing stores, western products and funeral ornament stores, which brought a reputation to the street,” he reads. In Rua das Estlagenas “Tissue trade is over 200 years old,” says the same text.
Other chapters of the book speak of the presence of the republican revolutionary in Macao in “The Starting Point of Sun Yat-Sen’s Story” [The Starting Point of the story of Sun Yat-Sen] or stories of street-linked personalities and their commerce.
In the conclusion of the work, it refers that after the transition, the street "faced new challenges: the global financial crisis, the SARS epidemic, the COVID-19, and the uncertainty of the economy, leaving the need for renewal again."
"In the past, the business has flourished, by themselves, thanks to hard work and resilience. But nowadays the community joins with a shared vision, actively planning [the development of the street] with the support of the Macao government and the integrated resort companies. With these efforts, there is a sense of hope that the street of the stalage will briefly recover its old vitality, being ready for a new era."
Institutional view
IC President Deland Leong Wai Man pointed out that the book results from the “weighted effort to widen the discussion around preservation and revitalization [of the street],” according to the same press release. "Street renewal is expected to inspire more people to learn about the historic neighborhoods of Macao and participate in their preservation, combining ideas and resources to ensure that the city's culture and history continue to prosper during generations," he said.
In turn, Wilfred Wong, CEO of Sands China, argued that "Street of Estalagues is a microcosm of Macao itself, a place where a rich story meets a modern future."
"The walls of their alleys witnessed the transformation of Macao, and their stories and people deserve to be remembered, as they are precious sources of Macao's cultural heritage. Our effort to publish the book was possible thanks to the collaboration of our local team to conduct interviews with owners of historical stores, create illustrations and take pictures, among other works," he said.
New facades
It is recalled that this publication arises after the Government was announced by the Sands performance at the Rua das Estalagens Revitalization Plan, namely with the “Entrepreneurs Recruitment Program for Rua das Estlagês”, launched in April last year.
The game operator explains that the seven businesses selected for the initiative “have been opening through phases, bringing energy to the zone along with other new businesses, providing a platform for young ambitious entrepreneurs to realize their dreams”.
In addition, the game operator intends to revitalize stores' façades “with drawings that enhance their characteristics, resonating the history of the street and the city”. For this initiative, Sands has also collaborated with the Macao Artist Society, and the drawings will be created by two young local artists, Chek On Law and Sit Kat Kit.
"The aim is that, with a collective effort like this, the community can rediscover the history of the street and learn about its past stories and stores through the visual interpretations of these local artists from Macao and their perceptions of the territory," he reads.
Siguo Chen, the book's author, is a veteran journalist with a career of over 60 years who has been deeply linked to the media area in Macau and Hong Kong.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 01:50:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Sun Yat-Sen | Marked centenary of the death of the “father of modern China”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/13/sun-yat-sen-assinalado-centenario-da-morte-do-pai-da-china-moderna/</link><description>Sun Yat-Sen died on March 12, 1925. Unavoidable figure in the political history of modern China and the father of the movement that led to the fall of the imperial regime, Sun Yat-Sen was celebrated yesterday in Guangzhou, where he was born, Beijing and Taiwan
 
The first president of China post-imperial and considered the father of the country's modern era, Sun Yat-Sen, was remembered yesterday in mainland China and Taiwan, the 100th anniversary of his death.
In Beijing, there was a “brief and solemn ceremony” of honor to Sun in Beijing Park that has its name. Authorities and “people from all the sectors of society” were present, kept silence and made three venias in front of their statue, the Xinhua official news agency said.
The Chinese Academy of History praised the political figure in his Weibo account, describing him as "a great national hero, a great patriot and a major precursor of the Democratic Revolution of China."
The city of Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, where Sun Yat-Sen was born, inaugurated on Tuesday an exhibition of old objects related to the man who was one of the promoters of the revolution that overthrew the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Building in the city welcomed the first performance of a musical based on the revolutionary's youth.
In Guangzhou, where there is also a university named Sun Yat-Sen, this exhibition is exhibited, which includes objects such as the Sun Yat-Sen Graduation Exam report at the College of Medicine for Chinese, in Hong Kong, from 1892. The certificate of marriage between Sun Yat-Sen and Soong Ching-Ling is also highlighted in 1915, a woman later, woman later, Vice-President of China during the government of Mao Tse-Tung, embracing communism. In the same exhibition you can also see the bronze bust of Sun Yat-Sem itself, made by order of the Japanese friend Umeya Shokichi in 1929.
The "father" of modern China was also remembered in Taiwan, with a ceremony by the Sun Yat-sen memorial in Taipei, where flowers were deposited and express respect.
Double memories
Despite founding, in 1919, the Kuomitang, which would become the main rival of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Sun is remembered in both mainland China and Taiwan. The Board of State's Taiwan Cabinet stated that Sun Yat-Sen “sought China's national unity and revitalization throughout his life,” appealing at the same time to the “compatriots of Taiwan to join us in the inheritance of his legacy” and to “oppose secession” of the island.
Born in 1866, Sun studied medicine in Hong Kong - then a British colony - and, after leading several revolts, gained notoriety as a revolutionary leader and as a driving force of an attempt to modernize the country.
In 1911, the Xinhai Revolution led to the fall of the Qing and Sun Yat-Sen dynasty was appointed provisional president of the New Republic of China in January 1912, but quickly gave power to the country's main military leader, Yuan Shikai, who, far from consolidating republican ideals, dissolved the parliament in 1914 and proclaimed herself in 1915, annulling Grande, annul Part of the democratic progress by which Sun had fought.
From then on, he continued to promote his ideal of a unified and republican China, reorganizing the KMT and seeking international support for his cause. In 1923, he established an alliance with the newly founded CCP and received the support of the Soviet Union to reinforce the political movement. However, he failed to consolidate a stable government before his death in 1925.
A LIFE OF FIGHT
In the work “Sisters Soong-the oldest, younger and redest,” by Jung Chang, some details of Sun Yat-Sen's life are described before embracing the revolutionary cause and the way he left his parents' house in Guangzhou, looking for a better life.
The place of destination was Hawaii, which on July 4, 1894 declared itself as a Republic, an event that, according to the book, "helped shape today's China." “A 27-year-old radical Chinese, Sun Yat-sen, landed in the archipelago and entered a world where the word 'republic' was in every mouth,” he is described.
In China, the agitation against the power of the empire became strong. The Republic "was a new concept," for "the monarchy was the only political system that China knew." "At the time, the country was governed by the Manchu dynasty," the Manchus "were not natural from China, but they had conquered the territory in the mid -seventeenth century." "Since they did not get more than one percent of the population, they were considered a minority of foreign rulers and had never been lacking opposition from the native rebels Han. Sun was one of them," he describes in the same work.
Sun Yat-Sen was "a low, dark man with well-proposed and pleasant traits." Its home village, Cuiheng, had soils inappropriate for agriculture, which provided “a life of extreme misery” to those who lived there. As such, the revolutionary's family did not escape adverse conditions.
In his first escape from the context of poverty, Sun went to Hong Kong, finding shelter to the diocesan school and boys orphanage, then accepted a marriage arranged by the family as a gimmick to return to the village. Sun Yat-Sen married Mu-Zhen, had children, but was an absent figure and something carefree in the face of family responsibilities, traveling the world to seek support for the revolution he wanted for China.
Jung Chang's work describes how Sun's course linked to the "three sisters," Ei-Ling, May-Ling and Ching-Ling. Charlie Soong funded and supported Sun Yat-Sen in her revolutionary causes, one of her daughters, Ei-Ling, became the republican secretary. This, although married, had made attempts to approach loving and EI-Ling, but eventually had a relationship with Ching-Ling, who was nationalist, but later embraced communism, being known as the "red sister." Ching-ling was also known as the Madame Sun Yat-Sen, but at the time of Sun Yat-Sen's death, the relationship between them had cooled.
After the establishment of the Popular Republic of China, Ching-Ling was vice president of the country, between 1949 and 1954, and then between 1959 and 1975, and was vice president of the Permanent Commission of the National Assembly.
Passage through macau
Moreover, Sun Yat-Sen's life crossed Macao several times, where he lived a short time, unlike his woman, Mu-Zhen, and the children who remained in the territory longer. To remember the short period in which the Republican lived in the territory, at the time under Portuguese administration, the memorial house of dr. Sun Yat-Sen, where he "witnesses the short but significant stay in Macao in the early twentieth century when, running away from the power of imperial mandarins, tried to move his supporters forces in order to implement a new regime in China." “In Macau received support from some friends who were illustrious and influential figures of social and political life at the time,” reads the description of the museum.
Another interesting detail of the 1911 Republican Revolution is the proximity of dates against the establishment of the Republic in Portugal, which took place on October 5, 1910. Macau, in the midst of events in China and Portugal, was only aware that the constitutional monarchy had fallen into Lisbon thanks to the sending of a telegram published in an official bulletin on October 10, 1910, changing the governor in this context.

The architect Maria José de Freitas regretted the removal of panels from Macao International Airport that told this same story
 
Between the departure of the plane and the entrance to Macao International Airport (AIM) was a corridor that told the history of civil and military aviation from the territory of the early twentieth century. The project of this area of ​​the airport is by the studio of architect Maria José de Freitas, which regrets the removal of the panels and historical information that were installed in 2013.
The architect left this idea in an intervention after the presentation of historian Célia Reis about the history of civil and military aviation in Macao on Monday, on the occasion of the “Spring Conferences” that take place at the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in Lisbon.
“We decided to tell the story of Aviation in Macao in this corridor, with a great extent, although at the time there was little documentation about it. I discovered some information in a work by Luís Andrade de Sá. We collected texts and images and put it all on the walls of this corridor, and that was there for a while.”
"With a new direction [at AIM], I was asked how I could prove that all these events had happened. I had documentation in Portuguese, but I had nothing in Chinese and English, and at a time when I moved to Portugal on vacation, I saw, when I returned to Macau, who had removed all the information and images from this corridor. This story is unfortunate," he added.
The architect added that she would like the history of the early days of Aviation in Macao to be told in these same walls. "It would be important to realize where there is more information, so that they realize the history of aviation in Macao, which was a pioneer. There was, for example, an aviation hangar near the mud houses, and there are a series of references linked to the history of this land that should be made visible at the airport, in the rooms, for example. This story should be told and things should be placed in the right place," he said.
Ricou plans
Célia Reis, historian and teacher, is developing an investigation project around the early days of aviation in Macao and this was the theme that led to the “spring conferences” on Monday, with the session “Aviation and Air Navigation in Macao in the 1920s-a process of colonial innovation”.
Célia Reis spoke of a time when aviation began to be important to China for security reasons, and also begins to be thought to Macau. In this process, there is a personality whose name is important, a Hong Kong -born Frenchman: Charles William Ricou, a engineering and aviation pilot. From November 1919 the possibility of “establishing an air career between Macao, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Philippines, Java, India” began to equate, from November 1919, the possibility of Macaoi, Shanghai, Java, India, "contacting local government entities to obtain facilities and agreements.
Célia Reis explained that Ricou intended to form two airlines, the “Far East Aviation Company”, with “a much wider connection, reaching Manila”, and another to connect Macau, Hong Kong and Cantão, named “Macau Aerial Transport Company”.
This company "was constituted in Hong Kong, with a capital of $ 50,000, and had as founding partners personalities from Macau, such as Humberto de Avelar, Rodrigues dos Santos, Francisco Nolasco and Francisco da Silva". The historian also said in the presentation that the idea "was to complete the rest of the capital necessary with low value actions so that they could be bought by all [the inhabitants] in Macao."
"There is even the appeal of the company's board of directors for the Macanese to subscribe to capital, showing that the company was extremely important for the inhabitants of Macao, highlighting its patriotic value, of solidarity with progress," he added.
"Several voices demonstrated at that time that the company's commercial success, at first, could be little or none, although it was thought that the company could have some profits, having the ability to transport the air mail. However, this transportation capacity would be extremely limited, as the number of mail objects to transport from Macau was 24 letters a day," said Célia Reis.
At the time it was thought that Macau would be a pioneer, because "it would be the first territory to the East to have an aviation company", something that would "bring more visitors and increase trade." The Government of Macao, then led by Governor Correia da Silva, "gives in to the company's appeals, granting various facilities, such as the permission to build a provisional hangar on public ground that was vacant or from sea access infrastructure." In addition, “exemption from payment of the fuel storage tax” was allowed.
Thus, Macao even had hydroavião and 21 American airmen hired by the company. "It was considered that it was the largest load of air material exported by the United States of America (USA), all brought to Macao." Then the company tries to organize itself, "even asking for space on Taipa Island, designed to have definitive hangars, although provisional concessions have existed." In this context, he recalled the historian, "there were subsidies, a contract for the transportation of postal bags", to "allow a development of air navigation."
Impasses to the end
In May 1920, a new worldwide aviation convention emerged, to which Portugal adheres, which causes the “Macau Aerial Transport Company” to be nationalized. The project comes to advance, but quickly retreats.
“The airline therefore accesses the condition of obtaining a subsidy, and having four aircraft available for military service in Macau, if necessary. The issue of defense was always present. There was then some disagreement between the conditions required by the company and those that the governor understood were necessary. In addition, the government of Macao needed the Lisbon authorization for the operation of the airline. Advance, and this one begins to negotiate with the company. But voices begin to emerge in Lisbon that will make things change. ”
This is the idea that the US would be showing hidden interests through the establishment of the company. "[In Lisbon] it is fear that this is the found form of an American aviation company to settle in Macao, Portuguese territory, by different ways."
First, Lisbon forbids, retreating in the negotiations, and the next governor, Rodrigo Rodrigues, "is not in accordance with the company, understanding that it will not be viable," which leads to the entire project and dialogue to be suspended.
Célia Reis also pointed out that "the government of Correia da Silva has undergone several difficulties in these years, in terms of security", having occurred "very serious incidents in the relationship between Portugal and China".
“For this reason, the governor considered that having airplanes was extremely important because, at this moment, China was also resorting to aviation. The authorities of Portugal, however, considered that the planes of Macao would be of no importance, comparing with the set of aircraft that would have China or even Japan. When permission for the constitution of the airline in Macao, Lisbon understands that the territory could have in a worrying situation and planes could have functions with planes Military, even if there were few, ”explained the historian. The project would fall, however, by land.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 01:43:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Clinical Psychology | The benefits and risks of the introduction of AI</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/psicologia-clinica-os-beneficios-e-riscos-da-introducao-da-ia/</link><description>Artificial intelligence is there to stay and its use in the field of psychology begins to be spoken. Recently, Deputy Lam Lon Wai defended its use and, in Portugal, the Order of Psychologists created the “PSIA” platform, which allows it to detect symptoms. Nuno Gomes and Goreti Lima, two resident therapists, talk about the benefits, risks and potential uses of technology
 
Understanding whether emotions can result in psychological forum diseases is something that is already possible to do using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The issue begins to discuss in Macao still shyly, namely through Deputy Lam Lon Wai, who in February interpelled the government about the need to apply AI tools in clinical cases with young people.
HM spoke to two clinical psychologists who work with residents of Macao, in person or distance, about the benefits and risks of betting on AI. Nuno Gomes, a psychologist in a local clinic, says that “is, for now, a help, and it will always be”.
"AI is an irreversible process and it is inevitable that it covers all fields of our lives, and in them is psychology and helps people. But I come from a field of psychology that is the humanist school, which is based on the relationship with the patient, so I see no great benefits, for the use of AI, because in human relationships AI does not enter," he defended.
Nuno Gomes believes that AI can help in the diagnostic phase, although he thinks "the psychologist will always be the central character." "AI can be an advantage in Macao for people who have difficulty asking for help. The use of the well -defined AI, even in ethical terms, can be very useful for the beginning of a therapy. However, at this time we are not able to use AI at the level of a more complete and background therapy," he said.
Nuno Gomes also recalls that for those who want to talk to someone, AI "can give the feeling that we are not alone and that is someone on the other side." It is a feeling that is still "strange", but "in the future will no longer be, because AI will be part of our day."
The psychologist believes that AI "may work as long as it is ethically well regulated and can help in brief therapies, but always as a complement to a larger process."
Goreti Lima, who has lived in Macao, continues to do clinical psychology at a distance with residents living in the territory. It is more skeptical in relation to the use of AI, arguing that human relationship is always fundamental for quality monitoring.
“Therapy is done in the relationship and these applications do not contemplate it. I think we can use AI to diagnose, see symptoms, but this we can also do with a book or article. ChatgPT already tells us some things in the area of ​​psychology, possible analysis of symptoms. AI helps in this process, but then the rest works in the therapeutic relationship. Data are stored like?
Recommendations in Portugal
In a written interpeação directed to the Government of MSAR, Deputy Lam Lon Wai questioned whether there will be “cooperation” between government departments, technological companies and local academic institutions in the use of AI in the area of ​​mental health. However, Goreti Lam regrets that deputy "do not speak in the figure of the psychologist."
“Academics have a different experience from psychologists and therapists, who have acquired this experience in practical terms. This develops over time. All these questions have to be thought when applying AI. AI can identify what the person has and even use, but then we have to take into account deontological conditions. Undersisted, ”he added.
Portugal is one of the countries where the application of AI in Psychology begins to gain some form, to the point of the Order of Portuguese Psychologists (OPP) has created the online “Psia” tool, which allows you to state a series of symptoms and reach a diagnosis. Personal data appear to be protected with the introduction, on the website, the citizen card number, with the digital mobile key.
In addition, OPP has created a manual of good practices, entitled “The Human Factor in Artificial Intelligence - Strategic Recommendations for Sustainability”, which states that there are “virtual therapists who can identify, in communication with people, emotional difficulties that facilitate deliberate psychological education”, as well as enhancing “the learning of techniques and skills that aim, for example, to reduce anxiety”.
In addition, the OPP document concludes that "some studies suggest that these chatbots, developed based on validated therapeutic models, may be effective in reducing depressive symptoms and even that some people establish a bond similar to that of a human relationship." However, “these evidence is not consolidated and security-related (people and data), eventual dependence on technologies and the responsiveness of support given to different psychological difficulties are not clarified”, it reads.
Regarding PSIA, it is referred to the OPP website that "on very specific or complex issues should not be used in tasks that require specialized judgment and evaluation, deep technical analysis or professional counseling." It is also clarified that the answers provided are based on “available documents and information” until July 31 last year, and PSIA “does not replace the role of a psychologist or any supervision activities”.
In the case of Hong Kong, some solutions are also beginning to emerge, which motivated, by the way, the interpellation of Deputy Lam Lon Wai. This is the case of Hollo, a mobile phone application developed in connection with the University of Hong Kong (UHK) that aims to “make mental health care more accessible to patients, service platforms and organizations”.
Hollo uses AI power and technologies to bring clinical practices standardized to another level of productivity, intelligence and digital connectivity. According to Cameron Van Breda, Hollo's CEO and co-founder, the company aims to be "an easily accessible tool in stress times, offering analysis and friendship suggestions for better mental health exercises." In practical terms, “focuses on young people from 12 to 24 years old, works in English and Chinese and introduce them to therapy and counseling practices through mindfulness activities and daily games,” reads UHK's website.
Almost the same
Asked about Macao's mental health landscape, Nuno Gomes understands that he persists "some conservatism and ignorance not only in what is AI and areas where one can apply, but also what psychology can do."
"Psychology is here to help people and in the context of Macao there is no such understanding yet. This stigma prevents many people from seeking help and AI can give this support. However, the older population is still very unaware of the operation of AI, but the younger people will increasingly resort to this type of platforms," ​​he said.
In general terms, "the overview of mental health has changed little from the pandemic," because "in general, people do not feel the need to express emotions and since they are encouraged to keep emotions, that when they are bad and stored a long time, they start to do harm. People do not know how to express them out of shame or guilt." Goreti Lima also understands that in the area of ​​mental health there is still some ignorance in Macau.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:36:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Architecture | Liu Jiakun won Pritzker 2025 prize</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/07/arquitectura-liu-jiakun-venceu-premio-pritzker-2025/</link><description>Liu Jiakun won this year's Pritzker Prize. Chengdu's natural architect was chosen by the work “coherent”, in peace with nature and the surrounding world. The organization of the prize highlights the “path that was neither linear nor expected”, and architectural projects with “convincing answers” ​​in environmental terms
 
In Liu Jiakun's work is the citizen who rules, without fixed lines or barriers, combining the old and the modern. But above all, there is a kind of consistency. The Chinese architect, born in 1956 in Chengdu province, won this year's Pritzker Prize, a distinction often described as the Nobel Prize in Architecture. With this week's announcement, the point that was missing to consecrate the talent of a man who lived and worked in a changing China was added and who narrowly did not give up architecture. By the way, according to the official information of the Pritzker Award on Liu Jiakun, his journey “until architecture was neither linear nor expected”.
The mother was an internal doctor at Chengdu Second People's Hospital and it was there that much of her days spent during her childhood. In the years when China lived intensely Maoism and then during the process of reform and openness, Liu underwent all political and social transformations as it grew. He attended the program for “educated young people” in the area of ​​agriculture, and then the Chongqing Institute of Architecture and Engineering, later called the University of Chongqing University in 1978. “As in a dream, I suddenly realized that my life was important,” he said, according to the official information of the Pritzker award.
The studio in his own name, Jiakun Architects, only emerged in 1999 in his hometown, Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province.
About himself and his work, Liu Jiakun said: "Aspire always being like water-permeating a place without having a fixed shape of his own and infiltrating me in the local environment and in the place itself." "Over time, water gradually solidifies, becoming architecture and perhaps even the highest form of human spiritual creation. However, it maintains all the qualities of this place, both good and bad," he added.
Regarding the attribution of Pritzker, the jury considered that the Chinese architect knew how to innovate, keeping the side more traditional than the profession can have. "Identity has as much to do with the individual and with the collective meaning of belonging to a place. Liu Jiakun revisits the Chinese tradition without nostalgic approach or ambiguity, but as a trampoline for innovation. Creating a new architecture that is simultaneously historical record, an infrastructure, a landscape and a remarkable public space," says the organization.
Spatial commitment
Building houses or buildings can be much more than simple building, establishing a commitment to space and the environment. For the Pritzker jury, "in a global context where architecture strives to find adequate answers to rapidly evolving social challenges, Liu Jiakun gave convincing answers that also celebrate people's daily lives as well as their community and spiritual identities."
Also according to the jury, "through a remarkable work of deep consistency and constant quality, Liu Jiakun imagines and builds new worlds, free from any aesthetic or stylistic embarrassment."
“Instead of a style, it has developed a strategy that is never based on a recurring method, but rather the evaluation of the specific characteristics and demands of each project differently. That is, Liu Jiakun takes the current realities and manipulates them to the point of offering a totally new scenario of everyday life. In addition to knowledge and technique, it adds common sense and wisdom to the designer's tool box,” he adds.
The note that presented the award states that the architect can project “a built environment that is often being pulled in opposite directions”, rethinking “the foundations of density through cohabitation, creating an intelligent solution that balances the opposite forces at stake”.
The jury also describes that "through a remarkable work of deep consistency and constant quality, Liu Jiakun imagines and builds new worlds, free from any aesthetic or stylistic embarrassment."
The largest projects
This year's Pritzker statement highlights the “West Village” project in Chengdu, classified as “transformative”, where Liu Jiakun knew “reformulate the paradigm of public spaces and community life”, “inventing new independent and shared forms of living together, where density does not represent the opposite of an open system”. The architect created here a space that allows "adaptation, expansion and replicability."
Also noteworthy are “subtle and memorable museums” created by themselves, such as the Suzhou Museum of Imperial Kiln Brick or the Shuijingfang Museum, also in Chengdu. In turn, at the Huishan Memorial in Chengdu, the architect "understands that identity is a matter of collective and personal memory, brilliantly raising the individual perspective to a fundamental element of place creation in order to revive a community dimension."
Degree in 1982, Liu was part of the first generation of students responsible for the major projects of the so -called “Nova China”, already with Deng Xiaoping to the rudder of the central government. At the beginning of his career, he was linked to Chengdu's Institute for Research and Architectural Design, a state-owned entity, having moved to Nagqu in Tibeta, where he lived two years in the 1980s.
About this time, the architect recalled his “greatest strength at the time seemed to be my fear of nothing, beyond the abilities of painting and writing,” pionering books and writing at night when he did not project.
His career in architecture was almost set aside until Liu Jiakun saw Tang Hua's solo architecture exhibition, a former university colleague at the Shanghai Art Museum in 1993. Such “rekindled his passion for the profession and fueled a new mindset that he could also be diverted from prescribed social aesthetics,” describes the pritzker jury.
For Liu, "architecture must reveal something - abstract, distill and make visible the qualities inherent to local people," "the power to shape human behavior and create atmospheres, offering a sense of serenity and poetry, evoking compassion and mercy, and cultivating a meaning of shared community."</description><pubDate>2025-03-07 02:59:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing | “Two sessions” start today focusing on the economy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/pequim-duas-sessoes-arrancam-hoje-com-foco-na-economia/</link><description>The month of March is synonymous with political movements in Beijing, with the political advisory conference of the Chinese people, which begins today, and the session of the National Popular Assembly, which begins tomorrow. At meetings will be discussed goals and political and economic plans for this year, without forgetting the evolution of the International Panorama
 
Today begins another session of the Chinese Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC), in Beijing, while for tomorrow is scheduled the start of the National Assembly (APN). The two events are the most important of the Chinese political system, materializing the country's political representativeness system, with the participation of delegations all provinces and regions of China, including the special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong. CCPPC has, as the name implies, an advisory character, while APN is the most important legislative body in the country.
The so -called “two sessions”, with annual periodicity, draw the attention from around the world because it is at this time that the Chinese government presents its economic goals and main political measures for the rest of the year.
According to the Xinhua state agency, data related to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the most attention points attracts, but the "two sessions" will also serve to shed some lights on China's foreign policy, something particularly remarkable in a turbulent global scenario.
Until March 11, the expected date for the closure of the work, there are objectives, calendars and essential policies, shaping “the political direction of the country” in a “complex and challenging global environment”, reads in Xinhua.
Let us look, then, to what we can expect in matters of GDP values. "As the Chinese economy is oriented towards high quality development, GDP is not the only measure of the economy, but it remains an important indicator. In 2024, China has achieved its objective economic growth of about five percent, thanks largely to a series of significant macroeconomic measures introduced to compensate for the pressure of economic recession," he reads.
Thus, "more concrete policies to stimulate economic activity are expected." According to Xinhua, "China has already given signs of change in its macroeconomic orientation." "At the last central conference of economic labor in December, political officials committed to apply more proactive macroeconomic policies in 2025."
Thus, the adoption of a “monetary policy‘ moderately flexible ’was decided, which represents a significant removal from the 'prudent' approach adopted in the last 14 years,” the agency describes. In this meeting were also defined “nine fundamental priorities”, the first “the increase of consumption”.
Thus, it is expected that in the “two sessions”, “China emphasizes internal demand as the main economic priority”, and this year it is expected “that large-scale equipment updates and consumer exchange programs will be promoted with greater intensity and more extended”.
It is indicated that "China will actively use the maneuver margin for a higher deficit and increase the issuance of special obligations of local administrations", as well as "continuing to issue Special Treasury obligations with a longer term and increase central government transfer payments to local administrations." The "two sessions" will reveal more details in this regard.
Featured
Still on the economic level, Xinhua describes how President XI Jinping underlines on other occasions “the main priorities, such as support for the growth of the private sector”, “the acceleration of the development of the digital economy” and the deepening of the country's opening.
APN members “will analyze the annual budget and government development plan”, and proposals and suggestions related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) ”are also expected to be expected. In fact, this is “one of the main points of interest to China observers”, along with GDP values. It should be noted that, in this field, the country has sought to score points and gain a growing positioning in the market with the creation of the Deepseek platform.
According to the Global Times newspaper, Chinese companies such as Tencent, Baidu and Byd are part of DeepSeek in the products and services they make available, and "some local governments have also announced collaborations with Deepseek IA models to improve public services."
“Many AI-related plans mentioned in work reports of provincial governments [from China] focus on building innovation platforms, promoting industry's deeper integration and improving political frames. It is important to note that the rise of platforms such as DeepSek reflects China's commitment to make leadership in technological advances and a greater strategic focus on talent and existence cultivation and existence. From an environment conducive to innovation, ”he reads.
The “two sessions” also constitute “a crucial platform for political legislators and counselors to present suggestions and promote ample consensus on national development” in the AI ​​area, and “some of them are executives of renowned companies and researchers”.
GDP: Maintenance
Still with regard to Chinese GDP, an analysis by Neil Thomas and Jing Qiang of the Asia Society Policy Institute argues that the “two sessions” should reveal “an even more agenda for growth than last year, with approximate objectives of five percent for GDP growth, four percent for the GDP tax deficit and two percent inflation in terms of consumption ”. "Measures should also be introduced to increase consumption and encourage the private sector in innovation," the authors write.
The same analysis of the Asia Society Policy Institute also highlights economic measures to prevent and combat unemployment, a problem that has affected the Chinese economy in recent times.
"China will also announce the annual goals for new jobs in urban areas and the urban unemployment rate. Last year, Beijing set these objectives in 12 million new jobs and 5.5 percent unemployment rate, and this year's numbers will probably be similar," is mentioned.
With regard to domestic consumption, China is intended to be more and more “a hub for product launch, winter tourism and has a 'silver savings' focusing on the area of ​​restoration for an elderly population”. Also according to the analysis of the Asia Society Polycy Institute, "other priorities include rebalancing economic platform regulations, stimulating economic activity in small towns, greater integration into the area of ​​the large bay and expanding investment in maritime industries."
Attention to Investment
The "two sessions" take place with Donald Trump to return to the presidency of the United States of America and certainly that this point will mark the external agenda of the meetings in Beijing throughout the week.
But still regarding the economy, the Chinese authorities will seek to present and discuss measures that may maintain foreign investment attraction in the country, after the launch of the “Action Plan to stabilize foreign investment”, on February 19.
Here is a “strategic change in Beijing's approach, moving away from tax benefits and subsidies and addressing the liberalization of specific sectors, rationalizing regulation and incentives for re-inbackets,” the same analysts point out.
Therefore, Beijing intends to “frame foreign companies into China's regulatory framework to turn them into long -term stakeholders, making local expansion more attractive than capital reafect to other markets”. Analysts also expect the "two sessions" to reveal concrete policies in this regard.
Sam Hou Fai in Beijing
The chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, has been in Beijing since yesterday to attend the opening ceremony of the third session of the 14th National Popular Assembly (APN), which takes place tomorrow.
Sam Hou Fai will be in the Chinese capital until Thursday of this week. According to a statement from the Social Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai will be replaced by the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, who acts interimly, the functions of Chief Executive.
In the 14th APN, the Government's work report will be reviewed and the analysis of the report on the implementation of the Annual National Economic and Social Development Plan for 2024. The agenda also includes analysis to the National Economic and Social Development Project for this year. The report on the implementation of the central and local budgets for 2024 will also be analyzed, as well as the central and local budget projects for 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 00:50:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Gongbei | Caught with 84 cell phones in vehicles</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/gongbei-apanhados-com-84-telemoveis-em-viaturas/</link><description>Gongbei customs authorities announced the interception of two cars with double enrollment, driven by residents of Macau, who tried to enter the interior with 84 old mobile phones hidden in the vehicles.

The vice president also recalled that the winners of the Economic Housing Contest in Zone A 2019 began to choose the houses, but that zone A, with only 98 selected dwellings, is the least popular.

Deputy and President Associations of the owners of Macao Restoration and Beverages establishments, Chan Chak Mo, defends the increase in government support to restaurants and local commerce. The statements were made to the Chinese Language Social Communication bodies, in the possession of the new social bodies of the Association.
According to Chan's explanations, restaurant owners are very concerned about the changes in consumer standards and the purchasing power of visitors. The deputy explained that although the number of visitors has increased in February and March, compared to the same period, that many restaurants are not feeling the benefits of this increase.
The most recent months were even characterized as periods with “suffering” revenues, which Chan said they contributed to aggravate the complicated situation of the restoration.
This scenario is added a lunar New Year with a very different impact, and not always according to expectations. According to the businessman, the restaurants with the large casinos benefited from the high time of tourism. However, the impact on other restaurants has been variable, and in many cases below expectations.
For this reason, Chan Chak Mom appealed to the government to launch new support measures, such as the consumer carnival, which begins next week, but also the effective revitalization of the old neighborhoods, greater facilities in issuing licenses to new restaurants and the creation of more tourism events, to bring visitors to community neighborhoods.
Recipes to go down
At the level of his restoration business, Chan Chak Mock acknowledged that even restaurants in the city's most touristy areas are suffering, with recipes presenting 10 to 20 percent.
When he tried to explain these changes, Chan indicated the breach of confidence in the economy of visitors, the environment of economic uncertainty inside and the reduction of the number of visitors in the Lunar New Year.
Faced with all changes, the President Associations of the owners of Macao Restoration and Beverages Establishments also admitted that the sector crosses a phase of “lack of belief” generalized.
In this context, and given the possibility of a trade war between the United States and China, Chan argued that the government should adopt more restoration support measures, such as distribution of consumer coupons and carrying out activities in community neighborhoods to attract tourists.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 01:47:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Health | Alvis Lo continues director for another year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/saude-alvis-lo-continua-director-por-mais-um-ano/</link><description>The Director of Health Services (SS), Alvis Lo Iek Long, saw his service committee renewed for a year, according to an order published yesterday in the official bulletin.

This was the promise of Sam Hou Fai for the future of Hospital das Ilhas. The government leader also stated that the executive is working so that residents can treat serious illnesses in Macau, instead of seeking treatment abroad
 
The chief executive said that the islands hospital, explored by the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, will reach "international influence." The statements appear in the official statement of a meeting, at the closed door, with the honorary president of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (Pumch) and president of the Chinese Association of Medicine Professionals, Zhao Yupei.
During the meeting, which was communicated on Tuesday night, Sam Hou Fai stated that “with joint effort” the government and the national institution “will definitely be able to create a first-class medical center with international influence, contributing to develop the sector of 'Health + Tourism' and enriching the comprehensive health industry”.
The Islands Hospital is the executive's bet to develop Macau as a health tourism center, with the exploitation of space, built with public capitals, was attributed to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. This bet is also viewed by Sam Hou Fai, and its predecessor Ho Iat Seng, as the way to reach the diversification of the economy of the territory.
Currently, the islands Hospital is managed as a private institution, so residents have to pay the price of use. The exception is only verified when residents are referred by health services to the institution, accessing medical care under public service conditions.
Stay in Macau
Among the statements cited in the official statement, Sam Hou Fai also pointed out the islands hospital as hope for residents to stop leaving Macao to treat more serious illnesses. The government leader said that "to achieve the goal of" treating serious diseases without leaving Macao, the Macao Medical Center gradually expands its external consultation services, which clearly demonstrates the determination of the government of MSAR in widening health coverage and optimizing the distribution of medical resources. "
The statements arise after the recent opening of external consultations specializing to non-residents of Macao, such as workers, students and others with special fixation authorizations.
However, the objective is to widen the service to health tourists. In this respect, the ruler indicated that the opening of external consultations "not only provides a convenient option to non-residents of Macao, but also increases the attractiveness for the residents of the Great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay and Southeast Asia countries."
During the meeting was also signed the agreement on the “Operational Cooperation Rate 2025 of the Island Health Care Complex - Macao Medical Center of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital”. However, the content of the document was not revealed, nor the eventual payment by the government to the institution of the interior of China.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 01:45:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Artificial Intelligence in Macao Culinary</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/inteligencia-artificial-na-culinaria-de-macau/</link><description>"Macau's Opulent Fine Dining Scene is Using Ai to Tackle Sustainability: How Restaurants in Galaxy Macau, Sands China and Grand Lisbon Are Leading The Green March Forward."
Amanda Sheppard
Macao's cuisine scene, a region known for its vibrant mixture of Portuguese and Chinese influences, is taking its first steps in a technological revolution with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (IA). AI entered the world of cooking as a tool of efficiency and innovation. In Macao, a territory with a diverse culinary heritage, AI application may reshape traditional approaches to food.
The fusion of advanced technology with rich culinary traditions creates a unique landscape, offering both opportunities and challenges. The historical background of the kitchen in Macau enhance the unique identity of the region. Macau was a Portuguese colony for over four centuries, creating an intricate mix of Asian and European culinary practices.
This mixture formed a rich culinary tapestry, with dishes such as cod and minchi macanese to gain local and international fame. As we examine this story, we appreciate the unique features of Macao's kitchen, which AI technologies are now prepared to improve. In recent years, the growing adoption of AI technologies in the global gastronomic scene has marked a significant change. Restaurants began to use AI for various purposes, such as improving customer experience and rationalizing food preparation processes.
AI -powered chatbots, for example, entered the world of food services, providing customers immediate assistance to navigate the menus, order, and make reservations. This technology eliminates linguistic barriers, allowing tourists and local inhabitants to get involved with culinary offers smoothly. In addition, the food preparation sector is watching the influence of robotics and intelligent equipment. AI algorithms can optimize cooking processes by analyzing data on ingredients, cooking times and consumer preferences.
This data -based approach allows bosses to focus on creativity by minimizing the risks of human error. For example, Michelin restaurants such as Chief Tam Seasons, SJM's Robochon Au Dôme, Galaxy's Walk Kitchen and The Londoner's Churchill’s Table are all stimulating change and received praise for using AI to improve operational efficiency and maintain high food quality standards. Heads António Coelho, Sally Jimenez and Cristiano Tavares do Lisboeta study the introduction of AI into their culinary practices. Mizumi's chief André Chiang is making progress in the world of culinary with technology. Known for his innovative gastronomy approach, chief Chiang has taken advantage of AI in his culinary developments. Its Japanese restaurant at Wynn Macau uses smart technologies to improve traditional kitchen techniques.
When using AI tools to analyze customer reactions and service standards, it can continually improve dining experience. The prospects for the role of AI in Macao cuisine range from the professionals of the sector. Some bosses adopt the integration of technology, facing it as a way of overcoming the boundaries of cooking. The supporters argue that AI can help maintain the cultural essence of Macaense food, while innovating with new flavors and presentation styles. By analyzing large amounts of culinary data, AI may suggest unique combinations of ingredients that could not occur to human heads.
On the other hand, there are those who express concern about the potential loss of authenticity. Critics argue that trusting technology can harm traditional kitchen methods and the human touch that is an integral part of the culinary arts. Its point of view underlines the importance of preserving heritage and emotional links associated with handmade food.
Despite these different perspectives, the thesis remains that AI's role in Macao's culinary industry can represent a fascinating evolution and not a substitution of human ability.

For each passage, after discovering the criminal sources, redoubled appetite and towel on the floor. The fifth element of this group was a dog that announced everything, predicted, and instigated the petitions. That was so hypnotic that we never knew why Zé wanted to be a boy. Now at a distance we can talk about an androgynous character who has never been linked to his feminine genre, where Ana, a hyper-sensitive, denoted a more intuitive pattern that was imposed on a highly passionate and dysfunctional group. It could be a libretto for the disturbing pentagon of a national reality that always culminates in five but never with children's craves. However, it is good to remember that there is still a very recent and searched Sebastião that would fit this prosody where strange corners and things would fit perfectly.
We are in March and we remember as if life was a first eternal time. After this comes Camilo Castelo Branco soon, and everything was headed to another much more radical tonic than any adventure between cousins, holidays, smugglers, and that's where we understand that a stage ended to enter another, more severe, complex and fierce in love. We realize that adventures never made us cry, but that our growing members and the pain of all this, for the first time distill other tears that would also bring that unknown element that is the first love. We went into puberty with a book in flames: "Love of perdition."
In order not to hurt the numerous “Camilians” passing through his birthday, it is worth remembering at this moment Alexandre Cabral, and also the libretto of António S. Ribeiro, a play based on the novel that made debut in the Theater of St. Charles in 1991, which is in fact a precious synthesis of the narrative of a jail that had to lengthen the driving threads of a dungeon in the dungeon: the dialogues: They bring us to the idea all the passages of the novel and leave us in an amaze that we no longer expected. Readings in this rereading become interpreters of the same voltage. Integration, disintegration, and the text continues. And this is where the literary act begins: we no longer talk about our lives, emotions, things, but of an abstract, sensitive and larger archetype that produces a metalanguage that can challenge us as a human vibration that only a great author knows how to lead.
It was the fiero destination blows that Camilo wakes up to an absolutely monumental loving process where Ana Placido's late wounds will always be smaller things. It was this dimension between the liberal lover, bohemian, young and beautiful, and the graceful sap of Teresa de Albuquerque, hostage to absolutists and their reactionaries leaders, which the drama takes place as a victory of disinquued elements. The same country that did not allow love remains strangely unable to love. This love is an act of uniqueness and we must collectively take away the appropriate elections. It is also the tenderness of the fresh spring of life that makes desires a greater law, but…: And this is where we bump into the double condition. What does Mariana do as an element of this plot? We are in the presence of a great sacrificial archetype. Camilo has never ceased to be polygamous, and his transcendent desire to be loved finally finds the preferred victim.
Friend! My friend!
Now I touch you and you are real
And burns more than ancient delirium.
Now look at me and I grow up
I grow loud and very
More than the foam of the sea!
Simon Botelho would leave for the Indies at dawn on March 17, Teresa Albuquerque would die, Mariana would follow him until the ocean serves as a shroud. It is indeed a monumental instant. Camilo Castelo Branco was a writing professional, not a "parvenu".  Writing is a profession, so nothing is more worthy than your example done in an absolutely talented way. All moral considerations are now on two hundred years, and the most impressive is still the terms of knowing all other things.
When they ask; Are you a robot? I say no. Just for reading "love of perdition".</description><pubDate>2025-03-19 01:55:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong Budget for 2025-2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/18/orcamento-de-hong-kong-para-2025-2026/</link><description>Recently, the Hong Kong government presented its budget. In the fiscal year of 2024-2025, he obtained revenue of $ 559.6 billion of Hong Kong, the expense ascended at 754.8 billion, the actions issued reached 130 billion, debt reimburses were 22.1 billion, the fiscal deficit was 87.2 billion and fiscal reserves in 647.3 billion.
Tax revenues have fallen 45 percent over the past six years. The tax deficit was due to the fall of taxes on the sale of unprofit and the continuous increase in spending on infrastructure, investments and health services.
In the budget of 2025-2026, the Hong Kong government estimates that revenues reach 659.4 billion HKD, expenses are in the order of 822.3 billion, the actions issued reached 150 billion, debt reimbursement if they are 54.1 billion, the fiscal deficit of 67 billion and tax reserves reach 580.3 billion.
To reduce the fiscal deficit to 67 billion, the government has proposed measures to increase revenue and reduce costs. To increase revenues, the main measures will be the increase in actions from 150 billion to 195 billion in a five -year period, with more than three and five years, mainly for long -term projects such as the North Metropolitan Area and for the payment of short -term debt.
Another measure that is being considered is the application of “charging border fees to private cars that leave”, charging 200 hkd per car, although tourist buses and trucks are exempt from this rate.
As for expenses, the government provides to lower them to 113.4 billion over the next few years, freezing the salaries of civil servants, and eliminating 10,000 jobs over the next two years, reviewing the “reduced rates of public transport to elderly and people with disabilities” and reducing funding to universities.
After implementing these measures, the government expects to reach the budgetary equilibrium three years later, that is, in 2028-2029, standing in line with the precepts of the Hong Kong Basic Law that stipulates that it should be lived within the possibilities.
Looking at the budget in its entirety, there are three points worthy of attention. The first is that tax reserves are insufficient to meet unexpected large expenses. Tax year expenses of 2024-2025 were 754.8 billion, but the current tax reserves are 647.3 billion. If the government has no revenues for a year, tax reserves are not enough to cover expenses. This also means that if there is an emergency that implies large expenses between 2025 and 2026, such as if the pandemic is active again, the government will have financial resources very limited to its disposal.
The second is the non -existence of negative capital. In the fiscal year of 2025-2026, the revenues were 659.4 billion and the expense of 822.3 billion. The difference between revenues and expense was 162.9 billion, which represents 25 percent of the total expense. During this period, the government's main source of revenue from “personal taxes” and “profit taxes”, which reached about 301.2 billion.
As the population of Hong Kong is gradually aging the government continues to cut into taxes to benefit people, and the amount of “personal taxes” and “profit taxes” will be reduced. Issuing actions is a way of contracting a loan. Although it can solve short -term tax problems and ensure that the government has sufficient cash flow, it does not solve the budget deficit problem and tax reserves will continue to decrease. In the long run, these two factors may affect Hong Kong Statute as an international financial center.
The most viable way of resolving the budget deficit is to ensure that revenues are higher than expense. “Charging border rates to private cars that leave” can be an effective measure to increase government revenues while encouraging people to make their shopping in Hong Kong, which will undoubtedly help the city's economy. Of course this measure may have some impact on Hong Kong's integration into the Great Bay area.
The third question is the number of measures to reduce expenses that can be taken. The government is thinking of freezing the salaries of civil servants, as well as eliminating some civil service jobs by reducing subsistence and social security expenses. As the population is aging, spending on subsistence benefits increase progressively and there is not much room for cuts in well-being benefits. In the long run, it may not be easy to get the goal of balance between revenue and expense by reducing government spending through austerity measures.
With an aged population and expenses to increase, the financial problem will only get worse. To obtain the budget balance, the government will have to have stable and long -term fiscal recitas. A few years ago, the government studied the possibility of applying a "rate for land and sea departures", similar to the "collection of border fees to private cars that leave." However, as the “Terra and Mar Departures Rate” is calculated on a per capita base, with the number of Hong Kong cars traveling to the city, for city residents to shop in mainland China, this rate would bring considerable revenues to the Hong Kong government and encourage people to consume in the city by helping their economy.
Another tax that was considered was the sales rate, a way to guarantee the government stable long -term revenues. According to a 2003 study, if the sales fee were 5 percent, the government would raise about 30 billion in tax revenues per year. With this tax, the fiscal deficit can be reduced. In addition, the government can impose higher rates on the highest and lower products on the first -need products, thus achieving the objective of wealth redistribution and reducing the moat between the poor and the rich.
Looking at the budget in its entirety, if the government does not increase revenues it will not be able to meet the expenses. If this situation continues, it will easily exhaust the tax reserves. Therefore, only increasing revenues can gradually get out of a complicated financial situation. In addition, social progress and various measures to the welfare of the population require capital. If the financial problem is not resolved, governance will be difficult.

But, I tell you a tragic-komic story that happened to the former chairman of the Council of Ministers during the time of the dictatorship that reigned before April 25, 1974.
Sources close to the dictator, Dona Maria, told us that the dictator was a daily listener of the humorous programs of the 'parody of Lisbon'. On one day, the dictator was in the ripation of the São Julião da Barra Fort, sitting in a canvas chair, catching his sun's rays and listening to a radio show from the team of Lisbon humorists. At one point, he found it so funny to a radio program that laughing several laughter and fell from his chair hitting his head on the floor stone and never recovered from the brain injury.
Now, after more than 50 years, another head of government has also fallen from the chair, but this one of power. Luís Montenegro when he took office as Prime Minister, due to AD's tangential victory, he said he was ready to rule for four years with transparency and stability. Two terms of the greatest importance in politics, but which were in no way fulfilled by the Prime Minister.
Last week, Luís Montenegro fell from the power chair for his sole fault. The politician, the PSD leader and prime minister in management began to walk in the mouths of the world for lack of transparency in his business that allegedly continued when he took seriousness and the lack of stability in his government due to the many cases that were registered in just over 300 days of governance, namely the 16 Portuguese who died that I INEM has made a strike and did not give clinical support to these people. About transparency it seems to me that everything is told and in the last chronicle we specified in detail the cambalachos of his family business and about the real estate of politicians who make them belong, while falling a singing star, in men wealthy with luxury houses, good Thursdays or a lot in Alentejo.
It happened that after two motions of censorship to the government had been failed, the Socialist Party entered the Assembly of the Republic with a potestative request for a parliamentary commission of inquiry into doubts in the activity of the Prime Minister's family business and which he never wanted to respond in full.
In the face of the socialist attitude, Luís Montenegro decided to gather the Council of Ministers and announce the presentation of a motion of trust in Parliament. Okay, it was the cradled broth. Everyone saw that Luís Montenegro had taken the blackmail and would confront the socialists in the sense if they withdrew the request for a parliamentary commission of inquiry, he also collected the motion of confidence. The parliamentary session that discussed and voted for the motion of trust was a shame in the history of 50 years of democracy. The government and parliamentary leader of the PSD made a very sad and disgusting figure who led to the condemnation of all parliamentarians, except a group called liberal initiative that still hopes to ally with AD and one day go to the Portuguese government. With the vote expressed in an absolute majority against the motion of trust we watched the fall of Montenegro, and its peers, from the chair of power.
Then the President of the Republic, who always disagreed with Montenegro in the presentation of a trusted motion, received the parties and gathered the Council of State announcing that the elections will be held on May 18.
The mess of the election campaign to end an election cycle never seen will begin. Montenegro is convinced that he will win and Pedro Nuno Santos convinced is. There are surveys for all tastes, some give AD to the socialist party. One thing is certain: the arrival will have much less deputies than it had in this legislature that now ends. We now surpass the electoral turbulence recorded in the second half of the 1st Republic, of bad memory.
During this period, four general elections were called to fill parliamentary seats: May 1919, July 1921, January 1922 and November 1925. Four electoral acts in six years and six months. Nonetheless, in a more dilated range than the hallucinating series of recent legislative elections: October 2019, January 2022, March 2024 and those that will follow on May 18. One hundred years ago, nothing substantial was being solved with successive calls to the polls. On the contrary, each touch the electoral rebound made the political and governing picture always more convivial. The story seems to indicate that everything will be repeated. The politicians of our day, whatever the quadrant, should assimilate the lessons of history. Before, however, it is indispensable to know her…</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 01:09:14</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC | World Poetry Day celebrated tomorrow with tertulia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/frc-dia-mundial-da-poesia-celebrado-amanha-com-tertulia/</link><description>This Friday takes place a session at the Rui Cunha Foundation that aims to celebrate poetry, such as what happens around the world.

In the form of gathering, the public is invited to pass the FRC gallery with a poem of their choice, in Portuguese or Chinese, to share with the other participants, in a will be with the purpose of enriching the common experience. Poetry, with its ability to thrill, provoke reflections and convey feelings, crosses centuries and civilizations, being one of the pillars of literary art.
Form of expression
According to the FRC, "more than a simple set of verses, poetry is a manifestation of the human soul, which can be lyrical, epic, social, philosophical or experimental, adapting to different eras and styles."
“From the sonnets of Camões and Liu Yong's classic poems to the free verses of contemporary poetry, this literary genre has been a powerful means of communication and resistance,” he adds.
The session will be conducted by the doctor and writer Shee Va, representing the Association of Friends of the Book in Macau, who will invite participants to reveal poems with special meaning in their lives. The conversation will be held in Portuguese and Chinese, according to the suggested readings.
Shee Va, a gastroenterologist and author of several books on Chinese culture, has been dedicated to various cultural initiatives, having integrated, in 2023, the IV Virtual Meeting of Lusophone Writers in Venezuela. In 2018, he launched a work on the opera in Macao, named “Opera at the end 18-Tome III”.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 02:11:39</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC presents “Law themes” by the end of the month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/19/frc-apresenta-temas-de-direito-ate-final-do-mes/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) promotes today, tomorrow and then next week, on March 26 and 27, at 6.30 pm, a set of lectures on law topics, on the “vicissitudes of the process (I)”, which aims to identify possible incidents in the judicial proceedings and address the respective regimes. The sessions will take place in parallel, in the Portuguese and Chinese languages, coordinated by Teresa Leong.
The sessions are organized by CRED-DM-Center for Reflection, Study and Dissemination of the FRC Macao Law.

According to Teresa Leong, "the judicial process begins with the dispute and ends with the decision to end this dispute." "If the process follows its normal course, without major starters, justice is naturally served without disorder.
With “process vicissitudes (i)” begins this approach with the analysis of the circumstances in which it can, or has to modify the subjects of a judicial process and their implications for the ongoing process. In the first session, that is, today, it will speak of the “subjective modification: subjective substitution vs. subjective cumulation” and “third party intervention: main intervention”. In the second session, a week later, it will be the turn of the presentation of the module “Third Party Intervention: Accessory Intervention and Opposition”.

This is the theme of the next book of writer Mário Lúcio.
In an interview with Lusa agency, the author of “The Devil was my baker,” said the work should be published next year, being in the revision phase and on the way to the 60 readings it does before giving a book by completed.
This time, the theme is the African presidents, who classifies “extraordinary literary figures”, giving the example of Kumba Yalá, former president of Guinea-Bissau, who died in 2014. The reader will never find the names of the presidents in the book, being only referred to as “the president” and having all in common being a “source of the delay in Africa's development”.
"We have had external interventions that surrounded the development of Africa, such as slavery, such as colonization. After we release these processes, came the dictators and they are clearly the source of disrespect for human rights, the source of delays, pile, crime.
Home in Kumba
The narrative begins precisely with Kumba Yalá, although without the name and because in the book they are figures of fiction, then passing through several African presidents, such as the one who brings together the family in a Christmas dinner, during which he distributes strategic places.
"Milhada, from tomorrow the part of the transport is with you; from tomorrow the planes are with you, my first wife; from tomorrow the central bank is with you, my bastard son; and the firstborn gets the sovereign background," he exemplifies.
The Cape Verdean writer also writes about another president who thought the Belgians were in collusion with an ethnic group to overthrow him and, to solve the problem, buys $ 144 million in Machins, Catanas, dagged and hoe that delivers one ethnicity to end the other, ”resulting in three months in the largest genocide in human history, with 800,000 people killed in 1994.
The work also features a character that crowns emperor and spends millions of dollars in Mercedes to receive guests for the coronation in Africa, at a time when the people lived with less than a dollar a day, regarding the figure of former Central President and Central African emperor Jean-Bokassa.
From president in president, history flows until reaching the only name revealed, precisely a woman: Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, former president of Liberia (2006–2018) and Nobel Peace Prize (2011).
The election of this woman, who "managed to take a country devastated by civil wars - Liberia - and stabilize the country," is "a message of hope." "I would say that women are more sensitive and this should probably have a genetic reason. That is, women get pregnant and men do not and the book even talks about it, because there is a pregnancy epidemic and the 72 -year -old president," he said.
In the book, the pregnancy epidemic reaches all women in the country and no one knows why and even some belly men go to the doctor. These belly men are afraid that at the source of pregnancy is a lesson: to know what the pain of delivery is. "The day [men] know what the pain of childbirth is, they will never kill the son of others again," he said.
The Bosses
The author recalls that, in Africa, as in his country Cape Verde, women are heads of family: educate, raise, work and their son is always there.
"I do not see a woman send the children of others, so in catadupa," he said, continuing: "I am convinced that women can save the African continent and the world, but not women who want to rule as dictators, but who really have access and support to actually rule with another sensitive, because I am not seeing another way out."</description><pubDate>2025-03-18 00:22:31</pubDate></item><item><title>COVID-19 | Collective case with 11 infected</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/covid-19-caso-colectivo-com-11-infectados/</link><description>Health services (SS) announced a collective case of Covid-19 in the center of Santa Margarida, in the mud, which caused 11 infected, including 8 home users and 3 workers.

Up to eight typhoons are also expected to pass within 500 kilometers from the city, which is about 65 kilometers from Macao, from June
 
The Hong Kong Observatory launched a 2025 forecast on Tuesday that points to higher temperatures due to the continuous impact of climate change. The entity that monitors the weather and climatic phenomena in the neighboring city, and is usually in line with Macao's weather and geophysical services, estimates that this year enter within 500 kilometers from the city to eight tropical cyclones, starting in June or even before.
The meteorology agency also stated that Hong Kong will be affected by storms and strong and localized rain, although it predicts that annual precipitation is located within normal values.
"Generally speaking, Hong Kong temperatures have recorded an upward trend in recent years. In fact, we have registered Hong Kong's highest wind temperature. It is the result of urbanization and also the effect of climate change," said Observatory Director Chan Pak-Wai, quoted by public broadcaster RTHK.
The director of the Hong Kong Observatory pointed out that 2024 was the hottest year since there are global records and that in the region 11 months were registered with temperatures above the usual.

In mild heat
According to the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) of MSAR, last year the average temperature in Macau was 23.6 degrees Celsius, 0.8 degrees above the medium values ​​climate, equaling the hottest year since there are records (2019).
By the way, 2024 was a year of records at almost all meteorological levels, adding to the high temperatures, tropical storms and torrential rain.
In the annual analysis of 2024, released in early January, SMG justified the most frequent occurrence of extreme phenomena and rising sea level with increasing temperature and ocean warming, representing a threat to coastal cities like Macao.
Last year, April was a highlight as the hottest since April 1952, “with the average monthly temperature, the highest average monthly temperature and the lower average monthly temperature beaten all records, reaching the highest values ​​ever for the same period,” SMG say. In total, Macau registered last year 42 hot days, plus 10.7 compared to climate average values, 31.3 days.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 01:57:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Shenzhen | Registered incident at Ling's nuclear central to</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/shenzhen-registado-incidente-na-central-nuclear-de-ling-ao/</link><description>Authorities announced the registration of an incident at the Ling Nuclear Center in Shenzhen, which had occurred on 27 November last year, when a chemical control system desalination box was left open after a replacement operation.
The case was reported on Tuesday by the Unit Police services, which received a report from the Guangdong Province Nuclear Emergency Management Commission on the Nuclear Emergency Management Commission.
"On November 27, 2024, during the process of replacing the delineation box of the chemical control system and volume of unit 1 of the Nuclear Ling Nuclear Central, the delineation box isolation valve was not closed as requested, causing the liquid level of the control tank to go down," was communicated, citing information from interior authorities. "The staff on the ground immediately suspended the operation, with the level of liquid of the stabilized control tank. During treatment, unit 1 maintained the operation safe and stable, presenting the parameters within normal, having not affected the safety of the central, its staff," he was added.
The nuclear center classified the present occurrence on March 17 as a level 0 deviation event, and communicated to the national supervision and control entity.
According to the International Nuclear Accident Scale (Ines), nuclear incidents are classified in a 1-7 school. For the interior authorities, level 0 is considered "as a deviation that is not included in Ines and is essentially for the correction of deviations and return of experiences."</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 01:54:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Schools | New guidelines for the use of mobile phones</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/escolas-novas-orientacoes-para-o-uso-de-telemoveis/</link><description>Sheng Kung Hui Macau's social services received requests for help -related help from children between six to eight years old. DSEDJ will launch guidelines for next school year on the heights and circumstances in which students can use their mobile phone
 
The government will launch a set of guidelines on the use of mobile phones for students of non -higher education schools in the territory, which will take effect from the next school year. The measure was revealed yesterday by the head of the Secondary Education Division of the Directorate of Education and Youth Development Services (DESDJ), Leong I on, during the Macao Forum Program of the Chinese channel of Radio Macau.
The official indicated that the guidelines will serve as a management guide, and a starting point for schools and parents to reach consensus, indicating the circumstances in which students can use their mobile phones, but limiting their use during classes and even intervals.
To help schools move to the new reality, DSEDJ is committed to supporting schools to buy cabinets to store the appliances.
In the same program, the head of DESDJ Curriculum Development and Evaluation Division, Cheang Sek Kit, recalled that the government spread among the schools in the territory instructions that should be included in the teaching system on good internet use. These instructions indicate that adequate and healthy use of the Internet by a young man should not exceed a daily average of one hour, with intervals of 20 in 20 minutes.
The screen pacifier
On the other hand, a representative of the social services of the Sheng Kung Hui (Macau) charity association has release to the public broadcaster microphones that internet addiction affects ever younger youths. Ho Ka Hong, social worker at the Anglican Church, linked the need to reinforce cyber literacy in schools and promote good use of technology among the young.
"Our organization mostly accompanies young people aged 10 to 24 years addicted to the Internet. However, we have already received requests for help from parents due to excessive internet use by children aged between six and eight years," said the social worker.
Ho Ka Hong recalled that in 2022, Sheng Kung Hui performed an inquiry into literacy on the Internet that it showed, unsurprisingly, that the mental state of young people deteriorates the time they spend online, with particular incidence for the use of social networks. "Young people are always aware of the notifications of their social networks, which can influence their emotions and cause anxiety," added the social worker.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 01:53:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | José Cesário warns of CTT problems</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/19/eleicoes-jose-cesario-alerta-para-problemas-com-ctt/</link><description>José Cesário, Secretary of State for the Portuguese Communities, defended Radio Macau that the usual conditions in the operation of the elections in Portugal, namely the May 18 legislatures, will occur again due to the functioning of the CTT. For José Cesário, these system conditions will affect the electoral participation of the emigrated Portuguese.
"The Assembly of the Republic has not produced any kind of legislative amendment that may be considered in a current electoral process. Therefore, if there is no change, the method will be exactly the same," said the official.
In practice, the voter will continue to have to receive the voting report by the mail at the indicated address, then deliver it to the CTT. However, delays in the operation of services or other bureaucracies make it possible to receive the bulletin on time and hours, for example, generating potential increase in abstention.
"We are fully aware that there are very varied difficulties in the domain of the functioning of the post office systems in various countries, and this is a difficult matter to overcome," he said. The Secretary of State hopes that the May Legislative Elections can take place "in the best way possible". "Unfortunately, I know very well that there are countries where the post office works will strongly limit electoral participation," he said.
The problems are of various order and go through situations where "people, for various reasons, or have changed residence, or not voting in several successive elections, may not receive the vote."
The Portuguese again go to elections on May 18 following the lead to the motion of confidence presented by Prime Minister Luís Montenegro, in the Assembly of the Republic, leading to the dissolution of Parliament.</description><pubDate>2025-03-19 01:58:02</pubDate></item><item><title>World Games | Special Olympics Macau win four gold medals</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/19/jogos-mundiais-special-olympics-macau-conquistam-quatro-medalhas-de-ouro/</link><description>The Special Olympics Macao Movement entourage has won 14 medals, including four gold at the Winter Games for people with intellectual disabilities in Italy. In a statement, the movement stressed that the entourage had only eight athletes, and “for most of them” was the first time they competed in the world winter games.
This is because the latest edition of the competition, which was scheduled to take place in 2022 in Kazan, Russia, was initially postponed due to Covid - 12 pandemic and then canceled due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The star of the Macao entourage was the 18 -year -old Chio Hao Law, who won two gold medals on the 100 -meter and 200 meters of snow races. In September, Chio was Macao's first athlete to compete in the Paralympic Games, finally ending the length heel race for athletes with intellectual disabilities in Paris2024.
Also in the Snow Race, 17 -year -old Huang Hou won a gold medal in the 200 meter race and one bronze in 100 meters. The other gold medal for Macao was for Sou Fai in the 500 -meter race in the speed skating. The 25 -year -old athlete also got a silver medal in the thousand meters race.
In the dance modality, the territory won two bronze medals in the individual race and two more medals in the mixed peer race, thanks to Chang Chak Kuan, 19, and Lam Cheng I, 16. The Turin2025 Winter Games took place between 8 and 15 March, with the participation of more than two thousand athletes from 103 countries.</description><pubDate>2025-03-19 01:44:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Real Estate | Room transactions go up. Down prices</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/19/imobiliario-sobem-transaccoes-descem-precos/</link><description>In February, 176 dwellings were purchased and sold at an average of 76,243 patacas per square meter. Compared to what was happening a year ago, prices suffered a 11.6 percent reduction, but 44 transactions were registered
 
Last month, the house price reduced 11.6 percent, compared to the same period, to an average of 76,243 patacas per square meter. The information was released by the Directorate of Finance Services (DSF). In February last year, the average price of the square meter of housing was 86,225 patacas, 9,982 patacas above the latest amounts released on Monday.
However, when the comparison is between January and February this year, the average price of dwellings has a valuation of 6 percent, from 71,917 patacas per square meter to 76,243 patacas per square meter.
At the price level, the reality is now different from what was happening in 2019. Before the pandemic, the average price per square meter was 98,618 patacas, which represents a reduction of 22.7 percent, or 22,375 patacas, compared to the data provided on Monday.
The information about last month shows that Colaane was the most expensive area in the territory, with an average of 83.5 71 patacas per square meter. In the mud, the average price of the square meter was 82,471 patacas, and on the Macao peninsula of 72,986 patacas.
Greater demand
The highest price reduction seems to have resulted in an increase in the number of purchases and housing sales. In February, 176 transactions were reported, 44 more than in the same period, when 132 were accounted for, which means growth of one third.
When the comparison is made between last month and January, there were 94 transactions, a break of 34.8 percent, from 270 purchases and sales to 176 transactions in February.
However, in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the market was more active than currently happens. In February 2019, 279 transactions were registered, 103 more than last month. However, in terms of the volume of transactions, February 2019 numbers approach the January registration this year.
The latest data also reveals that the Macao Peninsula was the place with the most transactions, a total of 126 housing purchases and sales. In second place comes the mud with 36 transactions and coloane, where 14 purchases and housing sales were registered.</description><pubDate>2025-03-19 01:38:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained the guts to the dogmas of the "modern". For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as António Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter My Dear Friend: You are a pure, excellent, and very noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

In an article published on the Chinese Wechat social network, the China State Ministry of Security explained that the accused, nicknamed Liu, worked as an engineering assistant at a state investigation institute, of which the body no longer provided more details.
Liu will have made unauthorized copies of sensitive documents and confidential information during his period at the Institute. After his dismissal, motivated by the perception of unfavorable treatment and the lack of promotion opportunities, Liu returned to the private sector and began to work for an investment company.
The convict will have allegedly participated in practices such as the manipulation of accounts on behalf of family and friends, as well as the misuse of credit cards to finance speculative transactions.
The losses resulting from these investments generated a situation of great economic pressure, which the defendant allegedly tried to alleviate by selling the information obtained illegally, reads in the article. According to the same source, Liu contacted a foreign espionage agency from an unspecified country to which he will have offered part of the documents in exchange for financial compensation.
After the first transaction, the agency ceased the contact with Liu. However, he again tried to sell classified information, which led him to make several trips to different countries over a few months.
The coordination between Chinese law enforcement authorities led to the monitoring of the accused's communications, which led to his arrest after which he admitted the acts, according to the ministry.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 02:20:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Seoul | Maximum alert before a decision on president</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/seul-alerta-maximo-antes-de-decisao-sobre-presidente/</link><description>South Korea police will activate the highest level of alertness and mobilize all agents on the day of the Constitutional Court's decision on the formal dismissal of President Yoon Suk - YEOL.
South Korean authorities announced the plan yesterday, in an effort to avoid mass protests and possible attacks on important facilities, including the court, in the midst of the current climate of political tension in the country.
The plan includes the mobilization of 14,000 shock police in Seoul, representing 60 percent of the disorder control forces available in the country, according to the Yonhap public news agency.
The exact date of the hearing has not yet been released, but it is expected to happen before the end of March. The Constitutional Court concluded at the end of February the analysis of Yoon's dismissal process, due to the imposition of the statement of martial law on December 3.
Personal safety units, detectives and special forces will be mobilized around the court, and antiDronist equipment will also be mobilized to prevent illegal flights on the area, which was declared air exclusion zone last week. Authorities have warned that any attempted invasion of the court will result in immediate arrests.
There are fears about a possible repetition of incidents of 19 January, when Yoon supporters broke into Seoul's Western District Court to protest the decision to prolong the president's detention.
During the clashes, attacks on police officers and journalists were reported, as well as damage to facilities. On Saturday, thousands of South Koreans filled the streets of downtown Seoul in major demonstrations in favor and against Yoon, without incidents.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 02:18:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Legislative Elections on December 7</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/hong-kong-eleicoes-legislativas-a-7-de-dezembro/</link><description>The Hong Kong government announced Tuesday that the region will hold elections on December 7 to Parliament, which for the second time will only accept "patriotic candidates."
Hong Kong government leader John Lee has ensured that the vote will "select a new generation of legislators who are patriotic, capable and responsible." The chief executive also stressed that he asked the office of constitutional matters and the continent, responsible for relations with Beijing, to work with the Electoral Commission.
John Lee said the two agencies will “work closely (…) to make proper planning and elaborate contingency plans in areas such as advertising, recruitment and formation of electoral personnel”.
The current members of the Legislative Council (Legco), the 90 -seat Hong Kong Parliament, end the four -year term later this year. Since the last electoral reform in 2021, Legco does not have any representation of the opposition.
This is because the current regulation prohibits the participation of candidates who are not considered patriotic. All candidates must undergo a loyalty assessment and support at least 10 of the 1,500 members of the electoral committee, which also directly appoints 40 legislators.
Legco's structure states that only 20 seats will be elected by direct suffrage by Hong Kong citizens, less 15 than before the electoral reform.
The other 30 are filled by representatives of functional groups, mainly linked to specific industries, crafts or professions. The Hong Kong electoral committee currently has 90 seats, which will be filled in a new vote scheduled for September 7.
Almost 8,600 voters were registered with this body, which includes companies, professionals and delegates from the mainland China Legislative agency, according to 2024 data, published by the Hong Kong Free Press news portal.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 02:09:16</pubDate></item><item><title>By postponed by BYD in Mexico for fear of technology escape to the USA</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/adiada-fabrica-da-byd-no-mexico-por-receio-de-fuga-de-tecnologia-para-eua/</link><description>China is postponing the approval of a new BYD factory in Mexico, for fear that the technology developed by the company could end in the hands of the US, the Financial Times said yesterday.
According to sources cited by the British newspaper, which asked not to be identified, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce considers that Mexico would have unlimited access to BYD's advanced systems and technologies and that the country's proximity to the United States could mean that Americans could also access these technologies.
BYD announced in 2023 plans to build a factory in Mexico, where it would produce about 150,000 vehicles a year and create 10,000 jobs. The plan of the Shenzhen -based company also included the manufacture of cars in Indonesia, Brazil and Hungary.
However, Chinese automobile manufacturers need commercial approval to produce vehicles abroad, and Beijing is giving preference to countries that are part of their international infrastructure development initiative known as “track and route”.
For deciding
According to the newspaper, Donald Trump's return to the White House caused Mexico to lose some of the enthusiasm for the BYD project, making it more a priority to maintain relations with the northern neighbor in the face of the threat of rates on transionic trade.
After Trump's team accused Mexico of being a “rear door” for Chinese products to enter the United States without paying applicable taxes, the Mexican government announced rates against Asian country's textiles and Chinese steel and aluminum investigations for alleged unfair competition.
"The new Mexican government has adopted a hostile attitude towards Chinese companies, which makes the situation even harder for BYD," explained one of the sources cited by the Financial Times. For Rhodium analyst Gregor Sebastian, "the Mexican government would obviously like to get some Chinese investment, but its commercial relationship with the United States is much more important."
In a recent interview with FT, BYD's executive vice president, Stella Li, said the company “has not yet decided” what will happen with the plan to open a factory in Mexico: “Every day there are different news. We have to always be seeing how to improve and satisfy, to get the best result for everyone.”
However, in February, Li had advanced that Byd would choose the location of the factory before the end of the year. In 2024, the electric car manufacturer sold more than 40,000 vehicles in Mexico, and revealed that the goal for this year is to double the sales volume and open 30 new dealers in the country.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 02:07:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing greets commitment to a ceasefire in Ukraine after calling between Trump and Putin</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/pequim-sauda-empenho-para-um-cessar-fogo-na-ucrania-apos-chamada-entre-trump-e-putin/</link><description>China greeted yesterday “all efforts” to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine a day after US President Donald Trump contacted his Russian homologist Vladimir Putin.
"Since the beginning of the crisis, China has defended the resolution of conflict through dialogue and negotiations. We support all efforts to achieve a ceasefire, as we believe this is a necessary step in peace," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said yesterday when asked about the conversation between US and Russia leaders.
As for reports on the alleged involvement of Chinese companies in extractive activities in Russia's Ukrainian territory, Mao Ning said "he was not aware of the specific details."
"However, China's position on the Ukraine crisis has always been consistent and clear. The four points proposed by the [Chinese] President Xi Jinping remain our fundamental orientation line to address the issue," he added.
The White House and Kremlin reported on Tuesday about the call between Trump and Putin, in which the Russian leader temporarily agreed to suspend the attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure while Washington and Moscow exploit technical negotiations for a sea cease in the Black Sea and eventually permanent peace.
Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelensky said "Putin rejected in practice the proposal of a global ceasefire" and denounced Russian's continuous attacks on Ukraine.
Equilibrium
Since the beginning of the invasion, China has defended respect for the “sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries”, in reference to Ukraine, while appealing to the “legitimate concerns from all parts”, in reference to Russia.
Beijing opposed unilateral sanctions against Moscow and called for a peace process that respects the balance between European security and global stability.
In this context, China has maintained a close relationship with Russia, with an increase in bilateral trade and a diplomatic stance that has been criticized by the West, which accuses Beijing of providing key pieces to the Russian military industry, something the Chinese government denies.
On Sunday, will take place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, a new round of conversations led by the US, with the presence of Russian and American delegations, while Ukraine is expected to decide his participation in the coming days.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 02:06:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Beijing says he wants to work with France to “prevent the world from returning to the jungle law”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/diplomacia-pequim-diz-querer-trabalhar-com-franca-para-evitar-que-mundo-regresse-a-lei-da-selva/</link><description>The telephone conversation between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and French presidency Diplomatic Counselor Emmanuel Bonne served to reinforce strategic cooperation between the two countries in the growing global instability.
 
Chinese diplomacy chief said yesterday expect China and France to “work together to prevent the world from returning to the jungle law” in a conversation with the diplomatic counselor of the French presidency Emmanuel Bonne.
Quoted by Chinese Official News Agency Xinhua, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed that the global situation is in a state of “growing uncertainty and instability” and appealed to France and China to “reinforce their strategic partnership, jointly protect genuine multilateralism and oppose unipolar hegemony”.
During the telephone conversation, Emmanuel Bonne said he hoped China play “an important role in obtaining a fair, solid and sustainable peace agreement” in Ukraine, a conflict in which Beijing has kept an ambiguous position over the years.
Power of the Word
Wang Yi said China "has always defended the resolution of the" crisis "through dialogue" and greeted "all efforts that lead to a ceasefire, a necessary step towards peace," according to a statement released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the same day that US President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, agreed to start the process of peace with the peace process. Ukraine, with a partial ceasefire, centered on infrastructure and energy.
The Chinese diplomat also urged China and the European Union to resolve commercial and economic friction through dialogue, after months of disputes between the two parts on issues such as Chinese electric vehicles.
"France is opposed to commercial and tariff wars and is willing to work with China to properly resolve economic and commercial frictions through dialogue," said Bonne.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 02:04:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Panama | Beijing criticizes economic coercion</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/19/panama-pequim-critica-coercao-economica/</link><description>China yesterday avoided commenting on the deal reached by the Hong Kong Ck Hutchison conglomerate to sell its participation in the ports of the Panama channel to the Blackrock US fund, merely rejecting “economic coercion” on the international scene.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning has called on “consultation of the competent Chinese authorities” to obtain specific business details without referring directly to the transaction or reports of a possible Beijing interference to prevent the sale.
But he added that China rejects “economic coercion, hegemony and intimidation” at the international scene. The statements arise in a context of growing tension on the agreement, after criticism spread by a Hong Kong newspaper affiliated with Beijing.
The official portals of the Chinese administration in Macao and Hong Kong released on Friday the comment, widespread by the newspaper Ta Kung Pao, a publication of the former British colony seen as close to Beijing.
The newspaper considered that the deal it transferred to a consortium that includes Blackrock and the Investment Limited Terminal a participation of 80 percent in a set of port subsidiaries, which generate 43 ports in 23 countries, including ports at both ends of the Panama and Cristobal channel, "is not a normal commercial practice."

"This will happen in the not too distant future," Trump said to journalists during a meeting of the new Kennedy Center board, a famous cultural center of the capital Washington.
The US head of state also noted that senior Chinese government officials, “below” XI, will soon visit the US capital, although it has not advanced names or details about possible dates.
Trump mentioned Xi's visit by referring that he received visits from foreign leaders in the White House in recent weeks and asked them how Washington was. The Republican stressed that he is “cleaning Washington”, including trying to clean tents used by homeless and graphitis.
Last week the US media had reported that Washington and Beijing began discussions about a summit between the leaders of both countries in June.
The Chinese press had already suggested the possibility of a meeting in April. Also the Hong Kong South China Morning Post newspaper has advanced that Trump could move to China in April to meet Chinese homologist Xi Jinping.
Since the Republican's victory in US presidentials in November that Trump and Xi have expressed interest in holding a summit.
Open future
Since Trump's inauguration in January, US administration has threatened, and then suspended customs rates about Mexico and Canada, while committing to punish Europe and other business partners as well.
So far, China is the only country that has effectively faced widespread increases in Trump's rates decided.
The White House has imposed additional 20 percent rates on all goods from China, citing the role of the Asian country in the US Fentanil crisis. Beijing retaliated quickly at his own rates, adapting the answer to avoid climbing the tensions.
Other actions that are being considered by the Trump business team include restricting Chinese investment in the US and US investment in China, aiming at China-dominated industries such as shipbuilding, and further limiting the sale of high-tech products to Chinese companies.
Trump and Xi had already talked by telephone in January, days before the inauguration of the American for his second term, in a conversation in which they discussed business relations and the future in the United States of the Chinese company by the company bytedance.
Donald Trump said he was open to negotiating a new trade agreement with China and praised Xi repeatedly.
The two leaders reached an agreement in 2020 to end the trade war that harmed both economies.

China is studying measures to help export-dependent companies expand in the domestic market at a time when it seeks to compensate for the impact of protectionist measures on the United States and other markets.
The Chinese Ministry of Trade is currently exploring the most effective ways to help exporters reorient themselves to the domestic market. Minister Wang Wenta visited a Wide Textile Commerce Company this weekend, according to Yuyuan Tantian, an account on the Chinese social network affiliated to state television CCTV.
For Chinese exporters, a change of focus to the domestic market brings a number of challenges, including adapting to different preferences of consumers, payment systems and regulatory regimes.
"Integrating domestic and external trade and supporting exporting companies in expanding their local sales will be a long-term strategy rather than a temporary response to external shocks," reads Yuyuan Tantian.
The measure arises after US President Donald Trump has an additional 20 percent customs taxes on all Chinese products. Washington will also be preparing to launch a broader reciprocal tariff regime next month.
Beijing retaliated with the imposition of customs rates on a series of US agricultural products and restricted the export of various essential minerals.
But the trade war is already felt throughout the Chinese economy. China exports grew 2.3 percent, in homologous terms, during the first two months of 2025, a significant slowdown compared to the 10.7 percent growth in December.
Beijing also summoned Walmart executives for conversations last week, after being reported that the US retailer giant pressed Chinese suppliers to lower prices to compensate for the impact of increasing customs rates.
But Chinese companies face protectionist measures on other markets as well, including Europe and developing countries. Indonesia, for example, imposed up to 200 percent rates on Chinese textile products in order to protect the country's small and medium -sized companies against what it considers to be unfair competition.
The US is also an important market for China's textile and clothing industry. About 17 percent of Chinese textile exports and clothing went to that country last year, according to Yuyuan Tantian.
Look inside
To support the transition to domestic sales, the Ministry of Commerce plans to organize a series of exhibitions across the country to advise exporters to adapt their sales channels and product standards to the domestic market.
"The expansion of domestic sales to foreign trade companies is not about the flow of exports not sold - it has to do with the introduction of high quality foreign trade products in the domestic market," said CCTV -affiliated account.
The strategy fits the growing efforts of Beijing to increase domestic demand. On Monday, the government revealed a vast plan to stimulate consumption, which includes from reducing the costs of child care to stabilization of real estate markets and scholarships.
Signs of improvement are gradually emerging. Data released on Monday showed that retail sales in China increased 4 percent, in homologous terms, in the first two months of 2025, exceeding analysts' expectations.</description><pubDate>2025-03-19 01:46:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Ruby Hui, President of the Macao Autism Association: “Autism differs from person to person”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/19/ruby-hui-presidente-da-associacao-de-autismo-de-macau-autismo-difere-de-pessoa-para-pessoa/</link><description>Created in 2012, the Macao Autism Association continues to fight for more care for children and young people with this development disturbance. But the association's president, Ruby Hui, warns of the need for more incisive policies for adolescents and their specific needs, especially in access to employment
 
 
What balance does the work done by the association in recent years?
My work is above all to establish a connection with all the entities and resources made available by the government and also the game industry, as the authorities have started to [the context of the new game concession contracts] that develop more social support activities. Therefore, we have gathered all these resources to organize recreational activities for children and youth. In addition, we organize therapy sessions for our members. Usually, we request financial support from private companies and the government, covering 30 to 50 percent of these expenses.
The support of the game sector is therefore quite important.
Yes, but it has not really been a great support. For example, the government covers part of our monthly expenses, about 40,000 patacas. But this amount comes only to hire two full -time employees and one part -time employee. They are the ones who organize all activities, deal with the bureaucratic part, which includes the presentation of many reports to the government, because we ask for subsidies for almost half of our expenses.
Therefore, do you consider that they need more support from the executive to be able to hire more professionals?
Yes, it would be ideal. Associations like ours are getting bigger and the children we support are growing. I would say that 60 percent of our members are 11 or more, and about 20 percent are even larger, over 14 years old. We have to think about their future and the needs of therapy and treatment for adolescents, as it is not only small kids who need therapies such as speech or occupational therapy. They are young people who are still in high school and need to acquire different types of social skills, boys need to know how to deal with girls and vice versa. Then, when they become adults, they need to know how to deal with bosses in jobs. There are many valences to explore, but at this moment I would say that the supports are not enough.
Are schools not yet prepared to receive these students, for example?
Autism may be different from person to person. Students with autism, but who have better learning skills, are in normal schools. But parents tell me that there are not enough teachers with certain skills to deal with and teach these children. There are teachers who still have a very traditional mindset to treat these young people, who often have to deal with alone with bullying, for example. I would say that there are many children and young people with autism with psychological problems because of the school.
When it speaks of the traditional mindset, what does this mean in concrete?
In the case of my son, for example, he is obliged to always be sitting at school, but often likes to move and get up from his chair. From the point of view of parents who have children with this problem, there would be no problem, as long as it did not bother others, but for teachers it cannot be, and complain. They say things of the genre: "He will beat the table, he will move the painting, makes a lot of noise." Every day I receive complaints from parents to connect with the school, and for small situations like this.
What are the main difficulties or challenges that Macao families face when they deal with an autistic child?
In my case, my family is middle class, and we are financially well. But when my son was younger needed to do therapy and it was very expensive. Now these therapies cost even more. At the time my son was in primary education, 600 to 700 patacas was paid for each therapy session, but there are days a father told me that the sessions now cost about 1000 patacas per class, which is very expensive. Families of lower social classes cannot afford. Therefore, this support is one of the great objectives of our association, raising money so that we can provide explanations, therapy sessions or other type of support. All so that our members can attend classes with 50 percent discount, where the association pays half the amount.
When the association was created, what were its main objectives?
In 2012 autism was not a very spoken theme. Therefore, we joined [some parents and families] and we started to ask for support from the government and try to draw attention to the subject. We got some things because the government now gives more support to these young people, at least for those under 12. The problem we feel is that these young people are growing and adolescents need other types of supports that do not exist.
What is necessary to change in mindsets and society in relation to autism?
In Macao there are not many companies willing to hire young people with autism. Situation that is not seen in Hong Kong, where there are several hiring programs with social companies. Macau needs to follow this path.
One day in Rio
World Autism Consciousness Day is celebrated on April 2 and, in this context, the Macao Autism Association joined Sands China for a series of activities with children and parents, which took place last March 10th. Through the program “Sands Care”, the game operator provided a visit to the exhibition “Coastal Fantasia”, with the figure of “King Lobster”, a creation of Philip Colbert artist ” A boat trip through the Delta of the Pearl River.
In total, 70 people participated. Quoted by a game operator statement, Ruby Hoi said the tour "allowed children to enjoy the maximum of the trip." "Thank you for all the support provided to people with autism in Macau, and I hope that all sectors of society can continue to support the development of these people and promote their inclusion in society," he said.
For the game operator, this type of events can help “reinforce the cohesion of families dealing with autism, but also promote the awareness of society and support for the community of people with autism fostering a more inclusive and supportive social environment”.</description><pubDate>2025-03-19 01:26:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Paul French, writer: Looking for Wallis Simpson in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/17/paul-french-escritor-a-procura-de-wallis-simpson-na-china/</link><description>The Rota das Letras literary festival, which starts on Friday, will feature the presence of writer Paul French, who launched last year a new biographical book, "Her Lotus Year", which describes Wallis Simpson's experience in China before being a Duchess of Windsor. The British author will also talk about “Destination Macau”, a nostalgic and almost cinematic account of the city's history
 
How did you come to the history of Wallis Simpson's life experience in China?
I lived in Shanghai for many years and many visitors knew that Wallis Simpson had spent time in the city. Rumors ran on what he had done, and visitors always wanted to know if the rumors were true, such as the idea that she had learned esoteric sexual techniques or had posed naked for photographs. It was also said that he had belonged to a group of opium smuggling, or a group of bets that combined horses races. For me, as an author and expert in foreign experiences in Shanghai in the first half of the twentieth century, none of this made sense. So I thought this was the ideal time to really find out what Wallis had done in China. The fact that she was in the country in 1924 and 1925, two of the most fascinating years in the history of modern China, helped a lot.
How do you describe the life of the duchess in the country during that specific political period?
China was in total chaos when she was there, because Puyi, the last emperor, had been expelled from the forbidden city and occurred the biggest strikes ever in Hong Kong history. In addition, political fractions were recorded in Guangzhou, warlords of war in Shanghai and northern China. These were also the most wet years that there is a record in China, with crop production breaks and the occurrence of tiphoid and cholera fever outbreaks. He fired the number of bandits and pirates. Then, in March 1925, Sun Yat-Sen, leader of the Republican Revolution of 1911, died without leaving an obvious successor. Wallis came across all this, as he was retained on the island of Shamian, Guangzhou, while the city struggled; In Shanghai, he saw corpses to be brought to the city from the battles of the warlords; He saw victims of typhus and anger in Tianjin; and troops of the warlords threatening Beijing. But he was also largely in a foreign protective bubble that protected her from foreign soldiers and her white skin. He could delight in China's culture and aesthetics, while around him the whole country threatened to explode.
How was the personality of Wallis Simpson, a controversial figure in the context of the marriage to the Duke of Windsor?
It is very important not to confuse Wallis of 1924 with the later Wallis, from the long years of exile and controversy as Duchess of Windsor. In 1924 Wallis was only 28 years old, fleeing from a physically abusive husband (her first husband, Win Spencer, an American Navy commander) and was not yet particularly sophisticated or cosmopolitan. These were characteristics that would learn in China, mingling in the “colonies” [concessions] international foreign and bohemiums of Shanghai and Beijing. In fact, it was in Beijing that it first mixed with ambassadors, high -level Chinese politicians, high -ranking military officers and a stretch, and from them learned everything from playing Bridge and enjoying Jade to how to behave in high society. Obviously, this was useful a decade later when he met the Prince of Wales in England. Admittedly, the posterior Wallis, the Duchess, is a more difficult figure to like. Perhaps she and the Duke have made some bad political decisions and made some friendships, perhaps Wallis became a little bitter for not being accepted by the British royal family. But the truth is that in 1924 she was young, free of a bad husband and was in one of the most fascinating countries in the world.
What can readers perceive this figure and about China of that time, with "Her Lotus Year"?
China in 1925 was on the brink of potential explosion, as the whole country could have fallen into total chaos, dividing into the size of Portugal managed by warlords with private armies, or a resurgent Qing Dynasty supported by Japan in the North [China], the South and, of course, the foreign powers-England, America, France and Japan-who had Chinese lands like colonies. Ultimately, this did not happen, but no one knew this in 1925. Wallis herself oscillated between feeling incredibly comfortable and happy in what was her "year of lotus," as he described him, quoting Homer's Sopoifers who never want to return home; and feel terrified of the violence of the warlords or those who were against foreigners.
What are the biggest challenges, as a writer, in the process of researching the history of Wallis?
Wallis probably became the most photographed and spoken woman in history, more than Marilyn Monroe, more than Queen Isabel II. But in 1924 she was not famous at all. So it left a very difficult trail to follow. He wrote his memories, but these were "disinfected." A big problem was also the rumors that the British government and secret services circulated in 1936 in an attempt to destroy the idea of ​​a marriage between King Eduardo VIII and Wallis. The attempt failed because he abdicated the throne and they married, but these sexual rumors and insinuations, many of them racist and misogynists, have remained to this day, and they continue to be regularly recycled in the British and American Tabloid Press. I found the real Wallis a much more friendly character than I expected, and I hope readers will feel that too.
Is invited to another edition of Rota das Letras. How do you feel for being part of the festival?
I love to be part of the Macao Literary Festival. Although he had spoken before in Macao, namely in the Portuguese bookstore and other places, he had never participated in the festival. I look forward to being able to talk about Wallis Simpson and also about my new collection of rehearsals about Macau, entitled "Destination Macau". Some stories of Macao that have pleased me over the years, some of them presented with a more English look, as it were, may be interested and will be new to the local public.
Book | “Destination Macau”, the city between “The Imaginary and the Real”
Paul French has just launched the third volume of the “Destination” collection, which had editions of Shanghai or Beijing, and is now dedicated to telling stories of the old macao, a “place as imaginary as real”, as described the synopsis of the work. The work of the British author presents "The Macao by artists George Chinnery and George Smirnoff, the writers Deolinda da Conceição and Maurice Dekobra, to the fantasies of" Pulp Fiction "and febrile dreams of Josef Von Sternberg and Jean Delannoy."
There is still no shortage of Paul French, stories around historical figures such as Pedro José Lobo and Ian Fleming, author and creator of James Bond. Macao of the time of World War II, those who “came to Macao in search of gold, and those who sought war refuge” is described, not forgetting “the combatants looking for a secret passage through the 'neutral' macao”.
Paul French unveil mysteries or tells forgotten stories to many, such as the idea that Japan had tried to buy Macau in 1934 or the person who sailed with the Macau pirates queen, Lai Choi San. There are, in all, 18 stories “true of fascinating people who lived or visited Macau in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries”.</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 00:38:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Augusto Nogueira, President of Artm: “Macau is ahead of Hong Kong”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/augusto-nogueira-presidente-da-artm-macau-esta-a-frente-de-hong-kong/</link><description>The Macao toxicode dependent rehabilitation association is 25 years old this year. Augusto Nogueira makes a positive balance of the fourth century that began with a small therapeutic community and reached international recognition. The Association's president argues that, in prevention, Macau is at the head of Hong Kong and that the use of synthetic drugs is not yet problematic in the territory
 
 
What balance does the work developed by ArtM in these 25 years?
We do the balance very positive, because we started with a small area and a small therapeutic community. Nowadays we have a community with a capacity of 60 people, much more than the 15 we had at the time. We have developed several programs, namely the syringe distribution, which is a success, because it has led to a reduction and almost suppression of HIV contagion by people who inject drugs. For nine years there is the program and we have zero cases of infection. We developed support for social integration and follow -up after treatment, with “After Care”. We do preventive work in schools with the “Be Cool” program. We have the project “Hold on To Hope”, betting on vocational education, through coffee and the art gallery. It is a project that is well achieved and that turns out to be turned to tourism. We have visits from international entities and various non-governmental organizations, and the United Nations themselves. The most positive for us is to know how many people are recovered and who are well today. Unfortunately, we could not recover all people, but in each relapse there is always the possibility of the person coming again to do treatment.
How many people have recovered in 25 years?
We couldn't get this notion. We maintain contact with many people, but others have already left Macau, followed their lives. We have some contacts in the first two years after treatment, but then life goes on. People also want to go on a lifetime with no connection with the artm, sometimes marry and new companions don't know about their previous life and want to keep some confidentiality. But sometimes we meet. The other day they paid me a water without me knowing (laughs). These are small gestures that give us satisfaction to continue and make us believe that recovery is always possible.
What are the big challenges to maintain the ArtM project in terms of space and financing?
In terms of space and places for treatment we are well. The facilities are ten years old, there are maintenance problems, but this is more related to the panorama of construction in Macao. We need a space for the After Care, because what we have currently rented and is deteriorated. We are talking to the Institute of Social Action (IAS) to have a new space. With regard to the back, all our departments have financing, but we obviously seek support for our activities otherwise.
Regarding the authorities' posture regarding consumption and treatment, do you understand that it is still conservative in relation to other countries and regions?
This question is a little ambiguous. In terms of treatment and strategy in combating consumption, I think Macau is very ahead of Hong Kong, for example. In Macao, we have therapeutic community, we work on prevention and treatment, as well as our syringes and methadone distribution program. We have a range of treatments available to those in need. In the area of ​​prevention, the government has given a lot of support. The IAS has been quite open in strategies to combat consumption and prevention. In Hong Kong, for example, there is no syringe distribution program. Macao is from the few regions of Southeast Asia that has a government -supported syringes distribution program. But there could be another different interpretation of the law, with a differentiation between what is trafficking and their own consumption. For example, at this time if the person has a higher amount than that stipulated is soon considered trafficking, without proof. We think that in this case there should be a differentiation. It is then up to the police to investigate whether the quantities found are for consumption or trafficking. There should be an opening to give people more opportunities to be referred for treatment instead of going to prison. But lately, there have not been as many cases as that.
How do you describe the current consumer profile in Macau?
There is a large reduction in heroin consumption, and the few people who did so consume it today, or sleep. At this time the highest consumption is metabetamin, cannabis and some ketamine residues. As for the new synthetic drugs, there have been some records, but so far nothing alarming. But of course we have to be alert, we have to continue to do a good prevention job so that people are aware of the problems related to drug use. Regarding trafficking, we know that before the pandemic there was much cocaine trafficking to Macao, and after Covid-19 this situation almost ceased to happen. A good dissuasive work has been done and has to continue to be done so that there is less traffic to pass through Macau. It does not mean that there are no situations currently, but we are not in such a chaotic situation as that.
Speaking of synthetic drugs and their consumption, which according to the latest United Nations report has reached a worrying situation around the world. What is your comment to the scenario described in the annual report of the International Narcotics Control Board?
It is evident that the use of this type of drugs has been increasing over the years. Synthetic drugs are a real problem in the United States of America, for example, with fentanyl consumption, and Asia in some countries. It is a global problem because consumption and production are easy. Some of these drugs are made with other chemicals and many other products that are not well known to the origin and that can cause many overdoses. The UN suggests combating the production of ingredients that are used to produce these drugs, continue to reinforce the investigation to catch traffickers. But there are points of this report that it is necessary to follow, for many countries, which is the struggle between ideologies.
In what sense?
There is a struggle between those who argue that harm reduction is sufficient to combat all these problems that are arising, and that it is the solution to everything. Then we have those who think that harm reduction is not missing. In the artm we consider that there has to be a balance, because prevention is something important that cannot stop. What happened in Portugal, for example, when they liberalized the drug and failed to prevent and support treatment, [it was not good], and today Portugal is again in a slightly chaotic situation at consumption and trafficking. This means that prevention can never cease to exist. There should be quality treatments, with supervision of entities. The speed of access to treatment has to exist, and it can not be like in some countries where people have been waiting for a vacancy or permission to enter, as non -governmental organizations do not let the person enter until they receive the subsidy for each bed and patient. In these months a lot can happen. Damage reduction should be seen as a continuity for recovery, with rooms for consumption with medical and technical support, or syringe management programs. There is another problem, especially in Europe, which is heroin consumers, when they reach a more advanced age, already have many health problems and need sites to be, of a certain dignity. We have been wasting a lot of time with these ideological wars, and some of them exist for the sake of power, to influence the liberalization of drugs, and this is quite harmful. People's rights end when it begins to harm the rights of all other people, there must be a balance. As the report also says, there is a lack of medicines for some countries in Africa.

Art
To commemorate the 25th anniversary, the artm inaugurated on Friday the “Exhibition of the 25th Anniversary of Artm”, which is evident in the Hold on To Hope Gallery until the 23rd of this month. In the cultural space in the village of Nossa Senhora in Ká-Hó, which is part of the Occupational Therapy Program for the Arts users, you can see an art show done by these, with 45 works of ceramic, painting and wooden works. According to a press release of the association, the exhibition “celebrates resilience, creativity and healing”. “Throughout the last quarter of century, the artm has been a symbol of hope for individuals on its journey of recovery of dependence. This exhibition presents the extraordinary works of art created by our residents,” he is also read.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 00:28:17</pubDate></item><item><title>Debbie Lai, director of the center of the good shepherd | “Victims need more protection”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/debbie-lai-directora-do-centro-do-bom-pastor-vitimas-precisam-de-mais-proteccao/</link><description>Regarding International Women's Day, which was celebrated around the world on Saturday, HM talked to Debbie Lai, director of the center of the good shepherd, one of the entities that welcomes victims of domestic violence in the territory. The official defends speed in investigations of cases of domestic violence and more days of maternity leave
 
 
Regarding domestic violence, the law remains not revised, with many cases where it cannot be accused or condemned the aggressor. What needs to be changed in current legislation?
You should accelerate the time spent in investigating the case, as well as to make a simple promotion of the law, to let people understand what they will face if they report the situation to the police. There is still afraid of the complaint to the police, so what happens is that the aggressor, before a complaint, gets angry, again committing violence and the family is departed.
How many women are currently at the center of the good shepherd?
According to the License of Service granted by the Institute of Social Action (IAS), we can welcome 14 people, including children. We currently have 11 people, six women, three children and two girls living in our center. Some of these women have problems due to emotional conflicts, and although they already have some stability at this level, they continue to have financial difficulties. Many of these women are not permanent residents, so they are unable to apply for government social housing, and they need more time to save money to pay an income in Macao, which is not cheap. If young children exist, it is harder for them to find a full -time job, so these women cannot move in a short time for a home, staying in our center a year. And in this situation, the center cannot have more empty rooms to help other women in crisis.
Do you consider that more reception centers are needed for victims of violence in Macao, or more resources to ensure the victim's safety, since the territory is so small?
I think the resources are sufficient, but the investigation process is time consuming. Victims need more protection, as there is always the risk that the perpetrator continues to threaten them.
What is necessary to increase the birth rate and ensure that women continue to have access to equal economic and employment opportunities?
Promotion needs to be continuous, and should increase maternity leave, as in other countries there are more maternity leave. The monthly value of day care centers could also be decreased. The attribution of a subsidy by each child could also be considered if the family has financial problems.
There is a lack of support for single -padded families, where women are alone with dependent children, or where women are caregivers? In concrete terms, what needs to be improved?
I think yes. I think some of them do not know that there are resources in society to help them, or may not have motivation to seek help. Many of these women also do not want to rely on government, not even non -governmental associations or organizations that provide services to the family. But these women can always apply for the subsidy attributed by the Institute of Social Action, which gives them some money and allows you to stay at home to take care of their children.
How do you describe women in Macao currently, especially the Chinese community? Are you more emancipated and equal to men regarding their rights?
Nowadays the capacity of women has changed a lot, as they have equal opportunities and the right to develop. Many local companies are already chaired by women, for example. In addition to having physical strength, they can choose their jobs, attend higher education, marry and have the ability to take leadership positions. However, there are many women who come to Macau and marry residents and have a lower social position, suffering from various family problems. I speak of machismo that still exists, the addiction of the game, situations of toxicodependence or lack of communication. There are men who control everything, creating a climate in which the wife has to hear her husband and is devoid of self-esteem to get out of this situation. In such cases, it is very easy to have discussions, conflicts and even cases of violence between the couple. These are situations that obviously also affect their children.
International Women's Day celebrated in Macau
International Women's Day was celebrated in Macao in very diverse ways. In the case of Sands China, flowers were offered to the operator's workers as a way of expressing “the appreciation for the indispensable contributions that women make in the workplace, in the family and society”, can read in a company statement. It was also organized a debate that focused on the issues around women, organized by the Sands Empowher volunteer team, a “global initiative of diversity and inclusion led by women, which aims to connect the team's female members to create network job opportunities”. This event was broadcast live on Sands China's various digital platforms.
Sands Empowher is, above all, to organize training and mentoring actions so that women can develop in professional and career terms.
In the same note, it states that the company “is committed to building and maintaining a workplace with respect and equality”, defending and guaranteeing women's rights. Regarding sexual harassment, Sands states that it has carried out a campaign to prevent cases since July 2018, as well as actions that reduce cases of discrimination against women.
This was “the first in Macao”, and a “training action with all team members” on these themes was also carried out. Regarding support for maternity, "the company also offers breastfeeding rooms for mothers and performs a wide variety of activities for parents and children to promote family harmony."
At the Portuguese School of Macao, International Women's Day was celebrated on Friday with the DAC project-“Women who inspire”, an initiative organized by the teachers of the disciplines of Portuguese, Philosophy and Mathematics, among others. The 10th grade students have developed several works on inspiring women in the most diverse areas. One of them was the recently deceased poet Maria Teresa Horta.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 03:54:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP Macau | FIA confirms GT World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/gp-macau-fia-confirma-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>The World Council of the FIA ​​last Wednesday confirmed the expected, that the eighth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup will be held as part of the Macao's 72nd Grand Program, from November 13 to 16. However, there is a big news for this year's edition
 
The International Federation, which co-organizes this race in partnership with Sro Motorsports Group and the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), took the opportunity to announce a new qualification model for the race. In addition to the 30 -minute qualification session equal to the previous editions (Q1), a second qualification segment (Q2) was added, reserved for the top ten pilots of the first session.
The Q2 session will be held in Super Pole format, with each pilot to go to the track individually for a total of two qualification turns, and each pilot is also allowed to use a new tire set at this session. This novelty will allow qualification to be decided without interference from third parties.
The remaining program of the Queen of GT will remain the same as the previous editions, with the free training session, the traditional 12-lap classification race on Saturday afternoon, followed by the 16-lap main race that will decide the world's Cup winner on Sunday.
Veterans compliments
These measures introduced by the FIA ​​were very well received by the most experienced GT riders. This is because traffic has always been a huge obstacle in obtaining a good qualification return on the guide circuit, something essential for those who aim to win this title.
"It's an excellent idea to introduce the Super Pole session in Macao," said German Maro Engel, the winner of the World Cup last edition by Mercedes-AMG. This will be one of the most spectacular and exciting sessions of the season and should also secure sports justice.
Raffaele Marciello, for two occasions winning of this trophy, and one of the BMW factory riders, also reacted positively, adding: “In Macao, it was always complicated to make a clean lap. With this new format, you will not hear the excuse of traffic or a red flag. Having only two laps will be very challenging, but now the fastest pilot will probably be in pole.”
This is an opinion shared by Laurens Vanthoor, the World Cup winner in 2016, who said there will no longer be “apologies” in the qualification. Porsche's experienced Belgian pilot believes that “there will be an added pressure because you only have these two turns”, because in a difficult circuit like this, “if you make an error, there is nothing more to follow. In a normal qualification, you have more opportunities. Personally, a shootout is always something that I appreciate a lot. For pilots like this, it will be almost the highlight of the weekend.”
And the younger ones too
Chinese pilot Yifei Ye premiered at the Grand Prix last November at the World Cup. Ferrari's official pilot, which competes in the Endurance Fia World Championship (WEC), has left a good impression on the guide circuit, and he also welcomes the now introduced measurements.
“It's good to eliminate these red flag interventions and yellow flags, so that in the end, the one that really is the fastest to get pole position,” said Yifei Ye that she could return to the race this year. "In Macao, everyone is very close in terms of times, so it will be extremely difficult for pilots to try to get to 'Super Pole'. I think it will also be great for viewers."</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 01:03:51</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Célio Alves Dias will continue to run this season</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/gp-celio-alves-dias-vai-continuar-a-correr-esta-temporada/</link><description>Macaense pilot Célio Alves Dias was one of the long -term returns of the 2024 car.
 
The Macao Cup winner of Macau in 2021 was removed from motorsport at the time of 2023 for personal reasons, but last year made his debut in the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8). Despite the vast experience in tests of the specialty, having conducted several generations of tourism cars, Célio Alves Dias had never managed the new bobbinns that the Macao-China General Association (AAMC) introduced in its competition in 2023. Last time turned out to be of learning, with some difficulties in the tuning and behavior of the Japanese car.
Participation in races at the Zhuzhou International Circuit and the Macau Grand Prix made Célio Alves Dias realize that his Toyota GR86 was not at the strongest competition level. Based on the conclusions drawn from these experiences, he decided to start preparing for the new season.
"The car had to be all dismantled. My car was bought in Monday, and the chassis and the security arc, for me, were not well done," explained Fu Lei Racing Team pilot to HM. "This, I made the car too hard and very difficult to bow. I tried a well -mounted China car, and there is a difference. I had a long time in January, in China, with this car. Our cars, made in the same workshop, were very hard, which made it difficult to get around quickly."
If in the Macao Grand Prix, the house riders, excellent guide circuit, managed to equate the progress to their hong Kong opponents and the interior of China, in the initial races on the Zhuzhou track in Hunan province, it wasn't quite like that. "There are many differences between cars, but especially in chassis, because the engines, in terms of power and horses, are almost all at the same level. Our opponents have also experienced many pieces, many engines, even speed boxes, and chassis. Competition cars are always the same.
Silver Jubilee in November
Being a usual Portuguese name in the Macao Grand Prix in recent decades, Célio Alves Dias debuted at the Guide Circuit in 2000 and from then was a frequent presence and no faults in the race until 2023. This year, its objective is to account for its twenty-fifth participation in the biggest sports event of RAEM, but will have to align in the findings.
While awaiting the announcement of the 2025 calendar by AAMC, Célio Alves Dias details details to start his test program, because his Toyota, after being reviewed, "is ready to test" in the interior of China, something that will happen "very soon," says the pilot.
In the last edition of the Grand Prix, Célio Alves Dias qualified in 12th place for the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. However, his participation was short and unhappy: at the wheel of Toyota with dorsal No. 11, was forced to give up after being immobilized on the climb of San Francisco. The Macanese pilot was out of the race on the first lap, in an incident that caused the Safety Car.</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:50:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Iame Asia finals of Karting back in December</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/finais-da-iame-asia-de-karting-voltam-em-dezembro/</link><description>The Macao Karting International Award will receive again, from December 11 to 14, the Iame Asian finals. Like last year, the coloane karting race will give invitations to the very coveted world end of Iame in 2026.
Organized by the Institute of Sport, Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), Otk Kart Asia and Iame Asia, the 2024 event brought back the international spirit to one of the largest competitions of the sport on the Asian continent. Coloane's karting received several races and different categories of Iame Series Asia, recovering the international prestige of an event that has been the scene of the Cik-Fia World Championship events.
Pilots from the interior of China, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Italy, France, Austria, United States, Brazil, Chinese tape, Hong Kong, and, of course, Macau, filled the track from the field in 2024 for four days of intense Competition, something that has not been seen for several years.
After the success of the previous edition, the formula is repeated this year. Singapore's organization again chooses Coloane's karting for its biggest event of the season, confirming the presence of the usual categories: Cadet, Junior, Senior and Master.
Thank you Macau!
The Iame (Italian American Motor Engineering) is one of the world's leading engine manufacturers for Karting. Founded in 1968 by Bruno Grana, the company is headquartered in Italy and is one of the references in Karting Internacional, having bet strongly in the Asian market in recent years. The presence in Macau is part of this strategy of growth and expansion.
The announcement of the return to the territory was made on social networks: “After an incredible debut in 2024, we are back with the Macao International International Prize and the Iame Asia final for another epic confrontation! The city of emotions at high speed and legendary races will be the stage for the best pilots in Asia and everyone!
Satisfied with the reception in 2024, Iame Asia organizers took the opportunity to leave a "huge thanks to AAMC and the Macao government for their continuous support and confidence to make it possible!"
In addition to the Macao test, the 2025 calendar of Iame Series Asia includes three events in Malaysia and three events in Thailand.

The competition for local pilots and decides to find out the Macao Grand Prix in November will again return to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC).
After a year when the MTCS headed to the Zhuzhou International Circuit in Hunan province, AAMC listened to most of the territory pilots and chose to make these important races closer to the main interveners' house - the pilots. In recent years, the circuit of the surroundings of Zhaoqing has been the preferred stage for the realization of these races, due to the proximity and the fact that it serves as an operational basis to most teams.
The first of the two events scheduled for the 2025 MTCS is scheduled from 18 to 20 April, while the second round is scheduled from 16 to 18 May. The AAMC newsletter says that "all riders must go through a selection process before they can participate in the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix - Macau Touring Car Challenge."
Registration, for the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8), are open until March 29 and after the end of the registration period, "all applications will be subject to AAMC approval, which reserves the final right to accept or reject any registration."
The technical regulation was also published, as was officially confirmed the use of tires of the Italian brand Pirelli, which belongs to the Chinese conglomerate Sinochem, as had already happened on the last edition of the Macao Grand Prix.
Confirmation of the Great Bay
AAMC also confirmed the two findings for the GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4), which will be concomitant with the new Chinese Championship Sro GT Cup.
