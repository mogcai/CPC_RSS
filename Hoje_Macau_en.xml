Chan Ka Leong asks the government to launch a new major consumption award as soon as possible
 
From here until March and April a lot of water will still pass under the bridge. The popular saying goes summarizes the message of the president of the General Union Directorate of Macao residents, Chan Ka Leong, who thinks that until the presentation of economy support measures, contained in the SAM Executive Executive's Lines of Governing Action (LAG) lines (LAG) lines (LAG) Hou fai. Chan Ka Leong, who is also a member of the Executive Board, understands that short-term measures are urgent to stimulate economic development, support and revitalize small and medium enterprises before the presentation.
As such, the leader recommends to the government to urgently launch a new round of the discount coupons program, a major consumption award. In addition, the close connection between community groups, entrepreneurs and traders should also be promoted to organize events that attract people to community neighborhoods outside the tourist circuits. In statements quoted by the Chinese channel of Macau radio, Chan Ka Leong indicated that government intervention in both directions, economic stimuli and attractive events, can alleviate shortly the difficulties felt by citizens and small and medium enterprises. In addition, the leader thinks it is worth studying the possibility of launching another consumer card.
Divine message
Chan Ka Leong also indicated that the pecuniary reimbursement program, or pecuniary checks, should be optimized with regard to its beneficiaries. However, you think you will first have to gather social consensus, not expecting changes in the next lag.
The leader made the recommendations to the executive during a dragon and Leão dance ceremony, held on Sunday afternoon at the IAO Hon garden.
At the same time, the deputy and member of the direction of residents Leong Hong Sai pointed out as a solution to the economic problems of Macao the national support.

The deputy recalled that the demand for this type of housing has decreased
 
With the legislation that is currently in force, an individual candidate can only compete for a T1 fraction in competitions for economic housing. Also, after the house delivery, if the person contracts marriage, I had a child and his household increases, he cannot move to a more plated fraction.
From the perspective of deputies Nick Lei and Lo Choi In, the government has to amend the law that regulates economic housing and add flexibility to candidates and public housing policies.
Speaking to the citizen newspaper, Nick Lei stressed that the population has long wanted to change the law, relieving the normative rigidity that affects the demand for this type of public housing, but that the government has not corresponded to the will of residents.
The deputy linked to the community of Fujian also advocates the introduction of permanent candidacies in economic housing, ie the delivery of applications at any time and the entry to a waiting list, similar to what happens with social housing.
Supply and demand
Deputy Lo Choi In also defends the flexibility of candidacies for economic housing, but points out that in recent years the demand for this type of housing has decreased significantly. In fact, in the last contest, opened in September 2023, the number of valid applications (5,076) was lower than the available fractions (5,415). In total, 6,562 applications were delivered.
From the optics of Lo Choi In, to make economic housing more attractive it is necessary to increase the proportions of T2 apartments, lower the price of houses (which are too close to the private market) and allow buyers to resell fractions in the market. Currently, if a resident wants to sell an economic housing apartment can only alienate it to the housing institute for a value corresponding to that of the initial purchase.
Also in statements to the Citizen Journal, the deputy also showed concern about the increased rally credit related to mortgage loans for housing. Lo Choi in appealed to government's attention to a problem that he considers at risk the stability of the financial market of Macau.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:35:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Law chan u asks for the preparation of a five -year plan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/economia-lei-chan-u-pede-elaboracao-de-plano-quinquenal/</link><description>With the 2nd five -year plan of MSA to come to an end by the end of this year, Lei Chan U asks the Directorate of Regional Policy and Development Study Services to take stock and indicate how the Plan for the period is being developed. 2026-2030
 
Law Chan U intends that the government will make a situation of the progress of the work of the 3rd five-year plan of the MSAR (2026-2030), which is expected to take effect next year. The subject is addressed in a written interpeação shared yesterday by the office of the deputy linked to the Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom).
In 2015, the MSAR began to follow the interior model of China that every five years has a plan on the development of society for five years. The deputy defends this option and justifies that the “elaboration of a five -year plan helps to build a future development model and to define the objectives of economic and social development”.
In view of the importance it assigns to the plan, Chan U considers that it is necessary that the Directorate of Policy Study and Regional Development Services (DSEPDR) will update the work for the future program and to indicate when they will start the preparation work.
On the other hand, the Faom deputy intends that the executive will make a situation of the plan currently in force the 2nd five-year plan of the MSAR (2020-2025), which is in the last year of validity. “When the government is expected to start reviewing and completing the effectiveness of the five -year period?” He asks.
Among the deputy's concerns is also the need for “perfect convergence” between the end of the plan currently in force and the beginning of the future plan.
The Role of the Island
Throughout the question, law chan u virtually does not refer to content that I would like to see in the plan. However, he wants to know if part of the plan will aim at the deepened cooperation zone between Macau and Guangdong and where cooperation will follow “the spirit of Xi Jinping's speeches”, given at the time in Macao, during December of the year past.
Regarding the XI's speeches, law also argues that the “government must follow these instructions and take specific measures in the elaboration of the third five -year plan”.
At the same time, the Faom legislator argues that the 3rd five -year plan of the MSAR should be articulated with 15th Fivenote Plan of the Popular Republic of China and follow the example of what is done “successfully” within China.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:31:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Communication | Former candidate for Al Critica Sam Hou Fai</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/comunicacao-ex-candidato-a-al-critica-sam-hou-fai/</link><description>Johnson Ian, a candidate in legislative elections, criticizes the form of communication used by the Chief Executive to publicize the team of secretaries of the current term. Considering “incredible” the way the disclosure was made, Johnson Ian, who is partner of Deputy Ron Lam, argues that there are stories that have to be announced in another way
 
Executive head, Sam Hou Fai, announced the team of secretaries with which he will work in the coming years through a statement, without the right to a press conference or other additional explanations, which led Johson Ian, former candidate for the Legislative Assembly ( Al), classifying this action as “amazing”.
The former journalist and also president of the Macau Synergy Association, which is linked to Deputy Ron Lam U Tou, told the All About Macau newspaper that the form adopted by the executive to communicate policies through communications is “unidirectional”, unable to explain fully the questions to the population.
Johson Ian also warned that, on social networks, there are voices to doubt the new governing leadership, because there is not much “movement” of public actions and comments after the inauguration.
In the opinion of the official, if the government continues to communicate with the population simply through communications, this can impair their image and credibility.
"Macau has many problems that cannot be explained only through communications," he said. For Johson Ian, if Sam Hou Fai and the secretaries remain silent, it is certain that department heads and other subordinates will not make public statements either. This can cause a disconnection with society, he defended.
Fewer limitations
The new executive took office on December 20, but only communicated to announce the visits made in community neighborhoods with Sam Hou Fai and other members of the governance team. In addition, and according to Johnson Ian, no interviews were accepted on the fringes of activities and visits to associations.
Only Tai Kin IP, secretary for the economy and finance, answered simply to the questions posed by journalists on February 1, after another visit with the chief executive.
Thus, Johnson Ian suggests that the government will end the limitations of access to some media that, since October, are not allowed to enter some government services, with the argument that there is not enough space for all.
"Whenever it is said that there is limitation of space, the images show that there are many empty chairs, which demonstrates that it is a lie," said Johnson Ian.
The official said that there is currently a greater diversity in the local media, as it is not limited to publishing on paper, also using social networks and digital platforms to make content and information, such as others media around the world. Thus, the president of the Association considers that the MSAR also has to follow this trend in order to welcome the visions of the media, rather than limiting them in their action.
Johnson Ian presented the cases of some rulers from Europe, USA and Hong Kong who resort to social networks to give public explanations and comment on various issues, also understanding that the current practices of the Macao government can no longer achieve the objectives they are proposed. For Johnson Ian, it is no longer enough to publicize press release to reproduce in traditional media, given the fewer readers or viewers compared to digital platforms.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:28:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Vocational Education | Alert Study for Human Resources Failures in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/ensino-profissional-estudo-alerta-para-falhas-em-recursos-humanos-na-china/</link><description>A study published in The China Quarterly concludes that there are still many questions to resolve so that technical-professional education in China can respond to human resources needs. The work warns of the “rapid massification” of this type of education, with priority for “number of enrollment over quality”
 
Technical-professional education in China has been popularized, but a recently published study in Cambridge University Press magazine “The China Quarterly”, concludes that there are still gaps to find that courses can actually respond to needs of the country in terms of labor in the industrial sector.
“More Graduates, Fewer Skills? Vocational Education Expansion and Skilled Labar Shortages in China ”[More graduates, less skills? The expansion of vocational education and qualified labor faults in China] is the name of the study developed by Xinmiao Song of the University of Lingnan, and Duudo XU of the University of Hong Kong Department of Sociology.
Academic work draws attention to the “disturbing trend” of “rapid massification of vocational education, which gives priority to the number of enrollments to the detriment of the quality of education” and that “does not respond to the search for skills and hand-based training qualified work ”.
In addition, the authors add to the “adverse consequences for both administrative management and teaching, caused by this scenario. “The development of competences often is up to post-school professional associations and an exclusive group of elite students. However, reform initiatives, such as the Manual Arts Campaign and competency contests, benefit only a few, without improving the prospects of employment of the student population in general. ”
Thus, the two academics argue that “more attention to the tensions inherent to China's teaching and vocational training system”, because “only when there is a deeper understanding of the underlying causes to the ineffective training of competences in vocational schools China can achieve its national objective of industrial modernization ”.
The study was developed in two vocational schools, and interviews were conducted to 104 students. In addition, ethnographic data of four doctoral projects were used in the area of ​​vocational education, developed between October 2017 and December 2020.
It is also noted that the country needs “increasingly urgent” of qualified workers “due to world economic competition”. However, "despite the massive expansion of the teaching and vocational training system in the last two decades, there is still a significant deficit of qualified labor," there is "debates about the ineffectiveness of vocational education." These focus above all on, “in the absence of institutional synergies between teaching and industry, but they often ignore the conflicts inherent to the vocational education system and the processes of competency training at the micro level”.
Practical difficulties
To the “micro level”, that is, in schools, the authors denote the existence of several difficulties in the effective functioning of these courses in line with the intended results.
In secondary education there is “a delicate balance between the promotion of social equality and the development of skills”. However, "analysis indicates that, in the context of the rapid expansion of secondary education, schools have difficulty effectively harmonizing these objectives."
“In order to maintain a proper student body, schools and teachers are often obliged to compromise the quality of candidates and teaching standards in the classroom. This situation generates a change in daily pedagogy and school administration to preserve discipline and stability, thus attributing the development of skills and the selection of talents-ideally a mission from the whole school-to extra-curricular professional associations, pursued Just for a few, ”is added.
It is also concluded that “the acquisition of competences is a multifaceted process, shaped by the dynamic interaction between educators and students”, because “the academic preparation of students and their motivations to learn are equally pertinent for the formation of microcompetences, such as the These are the resources of schools and the capabilities of teachers. ”
Thus, “the resolution of the ineffective formation of competencies requires more than the top -to -base initiatives”, “an approach that recognizes the obstacles that students face in the acquisition of skills, as well as their seizures and uncertainties, is necessary. In search of a job ”, it is mentioned.
The authors also talk about “elitism” in some formations related to handicraft courses and “competency contests”. "These initiatives may inadvertently suggest that handicrafts are reserved for a restricted number of people, as competencies contests often remain inaccessible to most vocational education students, both objective and psychologically."
Thus, the authors emphasize that "there is a significant undoing between this elitist approach to the acquisition of competences and the real conditions faced by vocational education students."
“The superficial promotion of manual labor spirit and the exclusivity of skills failed to truly resolve the challenges associated with the acquisition of skills, the search for employment and the commitment to follow technical professions among vocational education students,” is also mentioned.
Still, limitations in the study are referred to, namely the fact that it focuses only on public schools in higher secondary education, and the results may not completely represent other levels of vocational education, such as the higher institutes of vocational training ”.

Numbers from the “Factory of the World”
In the study is the intense industrial development that China has achieved in the last 40 years, emerging as the "factory of the world," as the authors describe, "taking advantage of their demographic dividends."
“However, the labor-intensive growth model has proved unsustainable due to population aging and intense global competition. To escape the 'trap of medium income', the Chinese government has launched a series of industrial modernization actions in the transforming industry and services sectors, ”but“ despite the ambitious agendas for the next decade, the persistent scarcity of qualified workers continues to hinder these efforts, ”is referred to.
By 2020, there were more than 23 million students of vocational education, so “this scarcity of skilled labor is a surprise”, is referred to in the study, which highlights “the substantial efforts and resources that the Chinese government dedicated to Improvement of vocational education in recent years ”.
For example, “Free Secondary Professional Education, the expansion of higher vocational facilities in one million students from 2019 to 2021 and the creation of universities of applied technology” emerged. In addition, the vocational education system watched an unprecedented trajectory, with enrollment in secondary professional schools higher than increasing from 4.56 million in 2004 to 7.11 million in 2009 ″.
In terms of the need for human resources, the study cites data from China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security for 80 cities in the country. “The ministry's quarterly reports revealed that the workfold/person who seeks skilled labor reached a historical peak of 2.0 in early 2020”, and “higher-level qualified workers, technicians and the upper technicians had a particularly high demand. ”
It is also noted that the Ministry of Education provides that the country continues to confront this year “with a deficit of 30 million qualified workers, which represents a 48 percent break in domains such as materials, the savings of energy and vehicles powered by new energies ”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:25:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Nanjing | Two of the last survivors of the massacre die at 99 and 89 years old</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/nanjing-dois-dos-ultimos-sobreviventes-do-massacre-morrem-com-99-e-89-anos/</link><description>Two of the last survivors of the Nanjing massacre, Yi Lanying and Tao Chengyi, died this weekend, 99 and 89, respectively, the institution that preserves the memory of the event yesterday.

"It was harder because it is longer, there are more characters, and Thailand is a beautiful place to film, but it had many challenges," the creator said at a Los Angeles release conference.
The new season has eight episodes, one more than the previous and two more than the original. It brings back two characters that the audience met in the first and second seasons: Masseur Belinda (played by Natasha Rothwell) and the widower of Tanya Mcquoid, Greg Hunt (played by Jon Gries).
“We were sad because the character of Jennifer Coolidge [Tanya] died in the last episode and we wanted to bring her back, in a way, with Belinda,” explained Mike White. Belinda was the masseuse that Tanya said she was going to help in the first season and then did not.
Explore Buddhism
White, interested in Buddhism for several years, wanted to turn to an exploitation of religion, God and spirituality this season. "Thailand seemed the perfect scenario because it is a Buddhist country and there is something in its culture where it seemed interesting to introduce the chaos of Western," he said.
Mike White also wanted to analyze how people seek to reach their ideal self, but they always seem to be supplanted "by a force that pushes them back to the land of monkeys." The omnipresence of monkeys in the resort where the characters are installed reinforces this idea.
Although with a different theme and rhythm from the previous ones, the narrative style of “White Lotus” remains this third season. It starts with a crime, where it is not possible to see who the victim is, and walks back in time to explain how to the tragic outcome.
In this resort of Thailand, the audience is presented to a group of three friends in the forties - Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan), Laurie (Carrie Coon) and Kate (Leslie Bible), whose relationship deteriorates over the episodes.
“Everyone is pretending to pretend,” Carrie Coon described at the Los Angeles conference. "And I believe that we can all identify with this to pretend that we live an extraordinary life, when we actually feel out," he added.
Leslie Bible pointed out that this is a problem exacerbated by social networks like Instagram, which make it difficult to resist comparison and judgment. "The lives of others look much more like a phone than in real life, which when they are really happening," he said.
Another key piece of this season is the dynamics of the Ratcliff family, with mother Victoria (Parker Posey), father Timothy (Jason Isaacs) and children Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), Lochlan (Sam Nivola) and Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook).
It is a rich family of North Carolina that has many more problems than it looks and will eventually face existential challenges throughout the series. All male members of the family have nudity scenes, something Patrick Schwarzenegger said it has become easier to do for the extreme confidence in Mike White.
"Making scenes of nudity is different when it comes to a screenwriter or director we do not know, who we do not trust or who have never seen work," said the actor, son of Arnold Schwarzenegger. “Mike loves to push the borders and continue to enthusiastic, but also give suspense to the audience,” Patrick continued. "I had no hesitation," he said.
There are also the couple Rick (Walton Goggins) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood), whose difference in ages and vision of the world and relationships will shock the paradisiacal scenario of Thailand. "White Lotus" will debut an episode a week on Mondays for two months at the Max Portugal service.</description><pubDate>2025-02-17 17:26:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Taiwan | Beijing says they have severely retreated in their position</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/taiwan-pequim-diz-que-eua-recuaram-gravemente-na-sua-posicao/</link><description>The Chinese government yesterday contested the review of an informative document from the US State Department, which eliminated a line on the United States opposition to Taiwan's independence. The United States "retreated severely" in its position on Taiwan and sent the wrong message to the island's "separatist forces", said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun.
"We urged the US to (…) to stop encouraging and supporting Taiwan's independence and avoid further harming relationships between China and the US and peace and stability in Taiwan's narrow," said Guo, when asked about the Review at a press conference.
The US State Department removed the phrase “we did not support Taiwan's independence” from the informative document last week. The document on US relations with the autonomous island is published on its official portal.
This is not the first time the state department has removed the sentence. In May 2022, the State Department removed the sentence, but once again put it a few weeks later, after a strong protest from China.
It is unclear why the State Department has changed the language again and if it signals some change in the policy of President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House last month. The US does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but are its strongest supporter and largest gun supplier.
China, which states that Taiwan should be under its control, has intensified the military exercises around the island of 23 million in the inhabitants in recent years. The US government informative document claims to expect that "differences will be resolved by peaceful, coercion -free means, acceptable to people on both sides."</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:50:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Flu | 64 -year -old man linked to fan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/gripe-homem-com-64-anos-ligado-a-ventilador/</link><description>A 64 -year -old man is hospitalized in serious condition and linked to a fan, after being infected with the A flu virus.

February 2025
The Chinese tradition says that the classic works of culture were not just four books: The Analects (《論語/1 论语》 lunyǔ), the book of Mâncio (《孟子》 mèngzǐ), the great study (《大學/大学》 dàxué) and the doctrine of the middle (《中庸》 zhōngyōng), and five classics: The Classic of Mutations (《易經易经》 Yì Jīng), The Book of Odes (《詩經诗经》 Shījīng), The History (《史記/太史公記 // 史记/太史公记》 Shǐjì/tàishǐ gōngjì), the rites (《禮記礼记》 lǐjì), the annals of spring and autumn (《春秋》 chūnqiū)), but four books and six classics, because There was one more relative to music (樂經/乐经) Yuè Jīng, which in the meantime was lost.
However, “music” (樂/乐 yuè) is so important to the Chinese that their synogram is confused in the written form with that of “joy” (樂/乐 lè).  From an etymological point of view, it is the pictogram of a musical instrument, whose base represents the wood part and the top the strings of it.  This, for the satisfaction that raises when it is touched, will serve by extension of meaning to figure the synogram of joy.
Music before belonging to humanity, depends on the deities of the Chinese popular animist religion and natural forces such as wind or biological beings such as birds, or mythological like fenices.  It is known that the yellow emperor (黄帝 Huángdì) ruled in a mythical antiquity that dates back to organized Chinese civilization. But this, according to one of the great Taoist philosophers of Chinese antiquity, Lie Yukou (列御寇 Liè Yùkòu ”) in the homonymous work Liezi (列子“ Lièzǐ ·) puts the emperor to make spiritual trips in which he finds feminine deities of matriarchal times, as Huaxu (華胥/华胥 Huáxū), mother of the first Chinese Emperor Fuxi (伏羲 Fuxī) and, therefore, ancestral matriarch of all Chinese or even the mother and/or mysterious woman of the ninth sky (九天聖 (圣) 母/九天玄女 jiǔtān shèngmǔ/jiiǔtiān xuannǚ), which will have taught him a lot, even in the case of the latter to appreciate music, poetry, and was also initiated by her, who had a human face and the body of phoenix, in the arts of love.
As for Phoenix is ​​the bird that symbolizes eternal life and peace; When the gray itself is reborn, it transports the hope of whole, renewed and peaceful beings, as it only arises in the world in times of tranquility and harmony. But it is also in close relationship with the music, because it is a mythological bird that sings, such as the wind, whose sound is composed for the Chinese by the melodious beating of the wings of the birds, when it comes to breeze, or the beating of the same in storm.
Linglun (伶倫/伶伦 Ling Lun) created the twelve shades following a request from the yellow emperor, which after being properly polite and trained his musical ear for the mysterious woman of ninth sky, was bored in the trips of inspection by Earth with The monotony of melodies. This great musician rushed to fulfill orders and surrendered with soul and heart to listen to all the sounds of nature to obtain the inspiration required to the mission. But it was in the Kunlun Sacred Mountain (崑崙山/昆仑山 Kūnlún Shān) that he obtained the lighting necessary for the creation of twelve shades by resorting to twelve bamboo tubes. How did he verify the right tones? “Loading the twelve bamboo tubes, Linglun reached the foot of the Kunlun mountain to hear the song of the Phoenix. When the birds sang, the male gave six shouts and the female answered them with six others. Linglun compared the twelve screams with his sounds and found that there was a perfect match between them. ” (Wang and Alves, 2009, 48)
He had reached his goal. The shades followed the model of the Phoenices, when he presented his creation to the Yellow Emperor, having been precisely rewarded with the title of God of Music [音樂 (乐) 之神 Yīnyuè Zhī Shén] and the world has since filled with More beautiful melodies.
Going now to philosophy, the cosmos faced as a mysterious musical instrument is one of the favorite metaphors of one of the great Taoist philosophers, the prince of Huainan, Liu an [劉 (刘) 安 Liú'ān, 179? -122 BC] It leaves us a work of the early days of the Han Dynasty, entitled Huainanzi (《淮南子》 Huáinánzǐ). The work is known in the Chinese tradition also with the title of (《淮南子鴻烈》 Huáinánzǐ Hóngliè), whose meaning is “the radiant light of Master Huainan”, having been the sixth chapter translated by Canadian synologist Charles Le Blanc, under the Title Huainanzi 淮南子 Philosophical Synthesis in Early Han Thought, containing the suggestive subtitle The Idea of ​​Resonance (Kan-Ying 感應) with a Translation and Analysis of Chapter Six.
Suppose that the whole universe is linked, in the manner of the ropes of an instrument, spreading the sound, echoing and resonating when it touches a string, will have its western counterpart in the mysticism of the Pythagorean pre-Socratic philosopher and its assumption of the “music of the spheres”, that is, the melody produced by the stars in their heavenly trajectories.
Returning to the Master of Huainan, he is informed in section II of the IX of the sixth chapter, that “the mutual response of things belonging to the same category is deeply mysterious and extremely subtle” (BLANC, 1985, 116), to which the text corresponds to the text Original is in Appendix 1 (Blanc, 1985, 221-215): “夫物類之相應玄妙深微知不能論” (6/ 3a.5) 2. These lines can be explained by resorting to another postulate, “the mutual influence of spiritual qì 3 (天神氣 shén qì)” “” (6/4a. 1), whose visible action manifests itself in the similarity of the outer forms of things, But also in the complementary game of the female and masculine forces that make them creative and transforming, and the superior action, as the Taoists believe, is based on the invisible and silent mutual response (相應 xiāngyìng), that is, non -discursive, which It does not prevent it is intuitive and melodious.
The mutual resonance is sustained by a complementary game of the energies yin (陰/阴 yīn) and yang (陽/阳 yáng) at the most varied levels, guided by the principle of causality, which acts between similar and different beings, because it arises O Qì enabling and uniting what is distinct, in a perfect resonance, so as to figure the cosmos as Taiji or “Supreme last” (太极/太極 tàijí). Thus, section IV of Chapter VI is achieved, where musical resonance (6/6b.9-11) is exposed, which works metaphorically to introduce universal resonance, implying a “great immersion” in the “supreme harmony”, impossible to explain (Blanc, 1985, 138). We are told that an tuner of Sè (瑟), an instrument of Chinese strings with 25 strings (vaguely recalling an Arabil), when touching a rope, will obtain the mutual harmony of the same rope in another instrument. However, “if someone changes the tuning of a rope so that it does not respond to any of the five notes, but when touching it gets a resonance with the 25 strings, then there is a difference with regard to the sound, succeeding that it was evoked that to govern all others. ” (Ibidem) “改調一弦其於無音無所比鼓之而二十五弦皆應此未始” (6/6a.11).
The sage, holy, or supreme musician will be one who can put himself in a direct intuitive connection with Tao (道 道), without herself being able to provide the reasons for it. Dip in the numenal world, play and mix essences, becomes what you want and lives in mutual resonance, absolute and total musical, with all that exists, not just relative to your "similar."
There is a music story for Guqin (古琴 Gǔqín), another instrument of seven -string Chinese strings, told by Taoist philosopher Liezi in the chapter of the previously mentioned homonymous work, yellow emperor, 11th section, (《列子 黄帝》第十一 黄帝》第十一部分 Lièzǐ · huángdì ”dì Shíyī Bùfèn), which illustrates this universal resonance, easier to obtain a spontaneous mind, as it happens to children, and as the founder recalls Laozi (老子 lǎozǐ), the founder) Perfect heart-heart is that of a newborn. In the story that I present my translation below, the protagonist is a boy with whom birds play naturally, but when his father asks him to capture one of them in order to entertain himself, the birds distance themselves, That's why the score for Guqin calls on “the distance from water owls” 《鷗鷺忘機/ō ōuu lù wàng jī 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgte7wzut1y

海上之人有好漚鳥者 ， 每旦之海上 ， 從漚鳥遊 ， 漚鳥之至者百住而不止。其父曰：「吾聞漚鳥皆從汝遊 ， 汝取來 ， 吾玩之。」明日之海上 ， 漚鳥舞而不下也。故曰：至言去言 ， 至為無為。齊智之所知 ， 則淺矣。5

海边有个喜欢鸥鸟的人 ， 每天早上到海上去 ， ， ， 跟鸥鸟玩耍 “我听说鸥鸟都爱跟你游玩 ， 你抓一只来 ， 我玩玩。 ”第二天他来到海上 ， 鸥鸟都在空中飞翔而不下来。所以说：“ 最好的语言是没有语言 ， 最高的作为是没有作为。同别人比试智慧的想法 ， 那是很浅陋的。
There was a boy near the sea that liked a lot of water owls. Every day, he used to stroll by the sea where he played with the birds, more than one hundred.  Once, the father commented: “I heard that the water owls often play with you, grabs one for me so that I can also entertain me with them. “The next morning, by the sea, the birds danced over his head, but they didn't approach. For this reason it is said: “The best speech is speechless, the best action is not acting. If wisdom can be compared, then it is superficial! ”

“We arrived at the port of Chinchéu, we found three ships from Portuguese that had been a month ago that were arrived (from Liampó) of which we were very well received and wrapped with a lot of party and contentment and then gave us new land, and the merchant , and the peace and quiet of the port. ”
Fernão Mendes Pinto, pilgrimage, chap.57
"When the Portuguese, in the 16th Century, Recovered China to European Knowledge, Zayton Was in the longing the great haven of forreign trade."
Henry Yule, The Book of Marco Polo The Venetian, London, John Murray, 1874, Chapter LXXXII, II Vol., Pag 221, Note 2.
Among the reports of our 16th century chroniclers and adventurers there is some confusion as to the exact location of the place we called Chincheo. The toponym appears associated with two different but close spaces, the cities of Quangzhou 泉州 and Zhangzhou 漳州 or, by extension, the Chincheos will be the inhabitants of the current province of Fujian, and Chincheo may still be the name of the province itself. Now to Quangzhou, the two characters - who sound like "chuanchou" in Mandarin - have the approximate reading of "Chinchew" in the local pronunciation, in the Hokkien or Fulaohua 福佬话 福佬话, (the old language of Fujian), a subgroup of the great min of the South South spoken in the province of Fujian. From "Chinchew" to the chincheo of the Portuguese in China goes a very short step. Moreover, it is curious that, in addition to the Mandarin, the most spoken dialect in Taiwan, Formosa, is exactly the Hokkien since part of the island's population is originally from the Quangzhou region, emigrated to Taiwan in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Not wanting to enter any other discussion, I believe the city of Quangzhou, such as Liampó or Ningbo 宁波, in the neighboring province of Zhejiang, [1] will be the major ports of commerce and shelter of the Portuguese of the first half of the 16th century, still still Prior to the foundation and fixation in Macau, which will only happen from 1553/55, after our sailors, merchants and adventurers were expelled from these two cities by the Chinese because they are foreigners and have assumed behaviors of true haitao 海偷, the "pirates of the sea" as the Chinese called us. Just read the saga of António de Faria in the pilgrimage of Fernão Mendes Pinto to understand how to trade but also loot, steal, live extremely part of the Portuguese hundredists of the Portuguese by lands of China. Just as they entered the daily lives of other peoples, including Chinese.
Quangzhou or Chincheo, or if we want to Zaiton of Marco Polo that in his book he considers her “a of the two best and Mayors that sound in the world” was one of the first places on China's back to navigation, point of scale and often at the beginning of what is conventionally called the “sea silk route”. From here he left Marco Polo on his long return trip to Italy. It is believed that Zaiton, the Arab name in Quangzhou,-also associated with “olive”-gave rise to the words “satin” in English and “satin” in Portuguese, all related to the many tons of silk that exported by Porto from Quangzhou. [1]
In the dynasties Song and Yuan (from 960 to 1368), the city has reached the zénite of its development as the great warehouse of the seas of Asia. They were Muslim merchants, especially Persians - who since the ninth century they gave body to the expansion of Islam to the vast Southeast Asia - which settled in Quangzhou where they calculate they had reached 150 thousand souls. It was so strong its economic power in the city that between 1345 and 1365 were the subject of a brutal persecution by the Chinese powers, and there were thousands and thousands of dead. In the fourteenth century, Zaiton was also inhabited by Jews, Hindu and Catholics, and the Italian Franciscan Andrea of ​​Perugia was the first bishop in the city in 1332. Then dozens of mosques and three churches, all devastated in the persecution in those years.
In the summer of 2013, I am in search of the city of Zaiton, Quangzhou, Chinchew or Chincheo.
Seventy kilometers of bus since Xiamen and I arrive in the city that seems to me harmonious, well distributed by the valley and the hills that surround it. Where is the river, where is the port? I ask and are saying that Quangzhou has no sea port, only at the mouth of the river, in front of the islands, there is a small port for fishing boats. Path miles along the Jinhera River towards the sea. The river is hardly navigable, everything is blown away, the sand and mud have once deposited in the bed of deep water, the current city lives almost its back facing the Jinhera River and the ocean. The great port of Zaiton, the most likely Chincheo of the Portuguese in China, was swallowed by the mud, the sands deposited in the river, and, before its mouth, the waters almost disappeared with the centuries.
I get a taxi and tell the driver's wife, an affable and friendly lady, I want to go, always on the bank of the river, to the mouth. It's four or five more kilometers, but the driver asserts me that there is no large port, just a village of fishermen and fishing boats. We advanced on the road. I guess a hundred trainers, all blue, made in China, moved down there. There is even a port at the mouth of the river, also with benches and restingas, with a lot of sand and mud, but a port against the sea.
I leave the taxi and advance to the pier, for fishing boats aligned next to the jetty, I enter the confusion of those who arrive with fish to discharge and to sell. Women carry heavy buckets of fish suspended at the end of bamboo sticks, others sitting in stools clean crabs and oysters, others, still, with an entredious hair that turns on the head in a safe pulling by a kind of chopsticks, packing fish Loose and seafood that sell in small lots. There are men playing Weiqi, Chinese chess, and players loudly hitting the top of makeshift tables. Some fishermen, certainly tired of the sea, are quietly watching the bullied mixed with the calm of these seaside people.
Attraven the street, the way to the village next to the side that seems to keep the past centuries. Low wooden houses, some of one townhouse, decrepit and poor. Narrow streets, quite filth, small shops, one or another house of food, almost only fish and seafood, old planted in the threshold of houses, boys jumping happy by alleys and alleys. I'm in Quangzhou, in the chincheo of five hundred. Porto and the city should be so in the sixteenth century and, when returning, I prove, that I am not in a village but in the extension of the old Quangzhou urban fabric itself. Almost guessed Fernão Mendes paint with the conversation with António de Faria, perhaps his alter ego, in a reed, anchored at the mouth of the Jinhera River, here, Chincheo, the year 1545.
The next day, visit the Quangzhou Maritime Museum, meeting the history and the many navigations for these seas of Fujian, southern China.
In the fundamental Chinese sources there is almost no reference to Portugal and the Portuguese. If we were the first to terrify these stops, in the sea connection between Europe and the Empire of the middle realized in 1513 with the arrival of Jorge Álvares to Toumen, at the current Hong Kong, Guangdong province, we were not the pioneers in the navigations along of the back and in the stay in China. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Marco Polo, the Franciscan Muslims and missionaries, all journeying for the old Zaiton, deserve the honors of museum exposure, with the exposure of stones and headds recently discovered with extensive texts in Arabic and tumular stones with Christian crosses.
It is interesting to show the different types of boats that in the past have ventured into these seas, from the Junos of the High Sea of ​​Admiral Zheng He (1377-1433) that with these ships navigated to Mombasa in 1433, to the stems and ships, these yes linked to a Portuguese presence. Also noteworthy is the patriotic figure of Zheng Chenggong (1624-1662) or Koxinga, who from pirate spent the national hero after expelled in 1661 the Dutch seated 38 years ago at Forte Zeelhand, Taiwan, where they controlled Formosa Island.
Even next to the Maritime Museum is another three-story building, which also works as a kind of museum, the Islamic Cultural Center where the Muslim community once resident in Zaiton/Quangzhou is honored. At the entrance we came across a statue of IBN Battuta (1304-1377), Tânger's great natural Arab traveler, just below our Algarve, who in the fourteenth century undertook a very long journey to China and left us a fabulous account of their travels, something similar to the “book of Marco Polo”. Battuta lived for a year in Zaiton, exactly 1346. In the Garden of the Cultural Center we found a cemetery for the deceased illustrious Muslims in the city and it is also worth visiting the great Qingjing mosque, originally built in 1009 by the first proselytes of Islam and that remain restored ruins, and a portico. Taking advantage of the space adjacent to Qingjing, a new mosque has just been built with money from Saudi Arabia, not too large, but witnessing a long -term and relationship, not always affectionate and peaceful, between Islam and China.
Returning to our five hundred sailors will be to remember that the Portuguese of then were not much given to visit mosques, pagodas, Buddhist temples or Taoists. But in Quangzhou/Chincheo, since the year 686, a magnificent set of pavilions and pagodas dedicated to Buddha veneration, the Kaiyuan temple. Around the year 1100, in the Song Dynasty (960-1279) was inhabited by more than a thousand monks. Today, in the temple of Kaiyuan, stand out the two beautiful stone pagodas, equal, not too high, just five floors with the walls covered by low-relevous original, all dated from the thirteenth century when Zaiton or Quangzhou was one of the big cities From China.
Few people visit Kaiyuan. The unfolding of the gaze, a little reverence for the Buddhas, remember Portugal and the Portuguese of Anthony, and dilute me in the serenity of the day.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Work | Future Ready Talent Program released in Macau and Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/17/108890/</link><description>Wynn and insurer Aia are two of the 14 companies that are part of the “Future Ready” project, launched by LinkedIn on Thursday in Hong Kong. The program bets on vocational training in the two special administrative regions, with special focus on artificial intelligence
 
The LinkedIn social network, facing the world of work, launched last week in Hong Kong, a talent formation program that has the collaboration of 14 companies from the territory and Macao, namely the Aia insurer and the operator of the game Wynn. The program, titled “LinkedIn Future Ready”, aims to “equip professionals from Hong Kong and Macau with the skills needed to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market,” is referred to in a note of the organization.
The other participating companies or entities are the Cathay Pacific airline, the Chow Tai Fook jewelery group, the PLC group, the English Schools Foundation, the FWD group, Hop Lun, Link Asset Management, Mtr Corporation, a company Hong Kong's meter, and PCCW consultant, without forgetting Prudential, Swire Properties, which operates in the real estate market, and the Hong Kong Jockey Club.
The program includes "initiatives for the updating of skills, knowledge exchange and [sharing] of data based information." Essentially, “Future Ready” intends to “equip companies with tools and resources needed to navigate a workforce transformation scenario and promote a culture of innovation”.
Given the latest projections of the social network, which published, in January, the report "Work Change Report - Ai Is Coming to Work" [Labor Change Report - Artificial Intelligence (IA) is coming to work], the program “ Future Ready ”intends to make more training available in this area in both territories.
“The 'LinkedIn Future Ready' program is a bold initiative that aims to support the work force in Hong Kong and to Colmar Skills in terms of skills, as well as unlocking new opportunities in growing economy,” said Mei NG, director-general of LinkedIn social network in Hong Kong.
The official also added that the social network will work closely with the 14 participating companies, to build “a more resilient workforce” by providing “companies that develop and implement innovative talent strategies and ensure that their employees are equipped with the skills necessary to succeed in the future. ”
Skills below
According to the same statement, before advancing to this training program, an assessment of markets was made in both territories. It is concluded that “Hong Kong and Macao perform well in cross-cutting skills and innovation-both essential to navigating the dynamic current business landscape”, and by transversal skills, “communication, teamwork and leadership” is understood.
In terms of innovation, another factor analyzed, “Hong Kong exceeds the APAC average [Asia-Pacific countries] in innovation skills, reinforcing its role as a business center with future vision that also promotes transformation in industry” . However, the neighboring region “is behind APAC average in AI proficiency”, so the mentors of the “Future Ready” program consider that there is “an urgent need for initiatives to improve skills to help empower the workforce adapt without problems to technological advancement ”.
There is, in this domain, a “growing demand for AI -related skills”, as “77 percent of Hong Kong business leaders said they would hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills rather than a more experienced candidate without these skills” .
In addition, "although transverse skills remain the strongest area of ​​Hong Kong, the region continues to be below APAC average and is late in four of the five domains of critical skills evaluated."
One of the objectives of the program announced on Thursday is to “improve and requalify the labor” of both territories “for a future fueled with AI”, so that there is “a certain combination of technical and human skills”, constituting “A competitive advantage for professionals and organizations”.
The 14 partner companies will have access to more than 23,000 courses available on the “LinkedIn Learning” platform that are based on 41,000 skills sets, namely “curated learning paths, technology training, AI training and digital learning resources from Ponta ”, is explained.
The future accelerates
According to the same report released by LinkedIn in January, AI's growing adoption worldwide will lead to a "search for new jobs and skills." The social network data reveal that “more than 10 percent of hired workers currently have positions that did not exist in 2000, including functions such as data scientist, social networking manager, sustainability manager, customer success manager and AI engineer manager ”.
In the concrete case of Hong Kong, by 2030, “60 percent of all skills used to do a job will have changed, with the innovations of accelerating this transformation to 80 percent”, is mentioned. Thus, it is concluded that "this rapid pace of change has created a gap of competencies that is difficult to conform in the short term."
In addition to betting on professionals, the “Future Ready” program also wants to promote ideas and debates, promising, for example, “quarterly round tables for executives” and meetings “with sector leaders to discuss the evolution of jobs, skills and requirements of learning ”. “The program will also provide a platform for the sharing of best practices, influencing the broader development of the workforce in all sectors,” is still added.
Also noteworthy is that the LinkedIn report on changes in work structures describe the most usual forms of AI use, namely communication in human resources or marketing. Thus, "recruiters who use LinkedIn's AI -assisted messages to involve candidates are registering an acceptance rate 44 percent higher compared to the AI ​​-free messages." In addition, “marketers who use LinkedIn's ad campaign creation tool, Accelerate, are presenting a cost per 42 percent lower compared to the classic campaigns” of this social network.
For this report were held several inquiries, namely more than 2,500 entrepreneurs from five countries (United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and India). The questionnaire focused on executives from various business areas (human resources, operations or marketing) was made in nine country and had 19,991 participants from companies with over 1000 employees. This inquiry was held from 26 November and December 13 last year.
In worldwide terms, in 2030 about 70 percent of each worker's tools and skills will change, with the “emerging as a catalyst”, and “the investments made in AI [by companies] are starting to start compensate: In the last two years, 51 percent of the business that adopted the Generative AI reported an increase in revenues of 10 percent or more. ” “Unsurprisingly, 88 percent of top executives with top management positions said AI adoption to help accelerate business is something important to develop next year,” one reads.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Corruption | Report Alert for gaps in Hong Kong and Singapore</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/14/corrupcao-relatorio-alerta-para-lacunas-em-hong-kong-e-singapura/</link><description>The 2024 Corruption Perception Index presents Singapore as the third cleaner jurisdiction of corruption worldwide, out of 180 countries and regions. Hong Kong is in 17th place in the ranking, but the report leaves a warning: world financial centers remain vulnerable to corruption
 
This Tuesday was released the perception rate of corruption (CPI, in the English acronym), which analyzes corruption in the public sector of 180 countries and regions, the responsibility of the non-governmental organization international transparency.
In the case of China, the CPI reveals that there was no significant change. If 100 points means a country virtually corruption, and 0 points a highly corrupt country, China registered last year 43 points in 100, rising a position compared to 2023, occupying 76th ranking position.
The CPI also looks at Hong Kong's situation, which got 67 points in 100, occupying 17th position in 180 countries and regions around the world. Taiwan, is currently 25th in the ranking of 180 countries, and no change of positioning compared to the CPI of 2023.
To register the presence of an Asian country on the list of the four less corrupt. This is the case of Singapore, third with 84 points in 100, following Finland (2nd) and Denmark (1st). The list of the top four ends with New Zealand.
According to official CPI data, countries and regions that are considered “full democracies” have an average of 73 points, while those who have political systems in which “faults” have 47 points. According to the index, non-democratic regimes receive only on average 33 points.
The CPI analyzes corruption in 180 countries based on sources such as studies or specialists, measuring corruption only in the public sector. However, it is assumed limitations in this count, as the ranking does not include "corruption of private companies, financial secrecy or transnational corruption."
If the score represents “the level of perception of public sector corruption on a scale of 0-100”, the country's position in the ranking is only comparison with other countries, and these lists “can change merely if the number of countries are to alter".
Looking at the global scenario, the report points out that “once again that developed economies dominate the top of the 2024 CPI ranking”, it is countries that “have a long time benefiting from a strong rule of law, the operation of institutions. Government and Political Stability - Factors that contribute to a perception of low corruption levels at internal level ”. However, "these attributes make these countries main targets of corrupt actors for money laundering and protection of illicit gains."
The Money Trail
According to the report, the fact that developed economies dominate the CPI can give a false idea that these countries "are making corruption effectively and remains untouched." “This idea could not be further from the truth. In particular, the nations that constitute large financial centers are more vulnerable to the financial flows of corruption. While their strong institutions convey an idea of ​​integrity, financial sectors and regulatory staff often provide opportunities to explore gaps, reducing anti-corruption global efforts, ”is still described.
In this regard, the examples of Hong Kong and other territories associated with offshore jurisdictions are presented, where it is not always possible to determine the trail of money. “Western financial centers such as Switzerland, Luxembourg, or the United Kingdom have a history of scrutiny of facilitating money laundering movements. However, non -western centers such as Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates progressively have played similar papers and require similar analysis. ”
“Like western counterparts, they boast the existence of a strong rule of law and institutions with a proper functioning, even though bank laws, corporate structures and secret provisions allow cases of funds washing and diversion of regulations, avoiding the Detection ”of less legal cases, is still described.
It refers to the case of the transfer of African funds to financial centers, such as Carlos São Vicente, former CEO of an Angolan state company that transferred about $ 1.2 billion to companies registered in shorts, and later transferred companies, and later Tronches of money for accounts in Singapore and Switzerland. Only for a Singapore reported account, 558 million US dollars were transferred.
Opacity here
With regard to Hong Kong, it is revealed that by 2023 the territory "fines for four banks in a total of $ 3.2 million, negligent 0.0085 percent of the profits reported by these same banks this year."
Still regarding Raehk, it is revealed that "there is no central registration system on the possession of beneficiaries - it is simply required for companies that maintain this information for themselves." “Some types of investment funds are still exempt from maintaining records from their owners. With over 1.4 million companies registered in 2023, maintaining compliance with monitoring these rules is a huge challenge, creating gaps that actors in the shadow can easily explore, ”he is also described.
It also states that "opacity is even worse with regard to investment funds," with Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates "not having any form of registration of funds beneficiaries." “As a result, even the authorities have no way to know how many funds there are and how they operate in their countries, leaving the active adjacent to these funds alone. In cases where illegalities are suspected, the authorities trust the beneficiaries to provide information: a process that consumes a lot of time and is not efficient, ”he adds.
Money and climate
In general terms, the CPI report points out that, in the Asia Pacific region, "leaders have failed to wage corruption in the middle of climbing a climate crisis." In a note signed by Ilham Mohamed, Yuambari Haihuie and Urantsetseg Ulziikhuu, regional advisers of international transparency, consider that “governments throughout the Asia Pacific region continue to fail in anti-corruption promises”, drawing attention to the fact of the region Facing many natural disasters and being a “house of one third of the world's population, with the second largest number of young population” in the world.
“With no concerted efforts to combat corruption now, the first generation that is facing the extreme climate change will face disastrous consequences,” is described.
"Corruption obstructs environmental policies, wages climate financing and prevents advancement in regulations and policies, making those who have less resources more vulnerable," the report, which points out that corruption waging "the effective use of money. ”In the fight against climate change.
Pakistan is mentioned, “which has suffered unprecedented climate vulnerabilities in recent years, with systemic governance failures and barriers in the implementation of policies - including delays in the implementation of regulations and establishment of institutions within the 'Climate Change Act 2017' - have left The context of financing far below the US $ 348 billion projected for the end of 2030 ”.
Also noteworthy is the case of Vietname, which had 32 projects of solar and wind energy under investigation due to “abuse of power”. The report describes "that the lack of civic space for effective inspection, as well as a limited number of mechanisms for effective complaint systems support - such as informators protection - has threatened these fundamental programs."</description><pubDate>2025-02-14 00:11:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Defense | World expense increased by 7.4% in 2024</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/defesa-despesa-mundial-aumentou-74-em-2024/</link><description>The worldwide expense with the defense sector increased by 7.4 percent by 2024, but European countries can be unlikely to maintain their pace due to internal budget pressures, according to a study published yesterday.
According to the Military Balance 2025, produced by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), public expense with defense reached $ 2.46 billion last year, increasing in all regions of the world, except in sub -Saharan Africa.
European investment has grown in particular, especially the 23.2 percent increase of Germany, which would have surpassed the United Kingdom in military spending in second place in NATO behind the US.
IISS estimates that, as a whole, NATO European members spent $ 442 billion from the defense sector in 2024, less than a third of the total Atlantic alliance expense, which rises to $ 1.44 billion.
“With the persistence of budgetary pressures in most European countries, it is likely that it is difficult to maintain the increase in expenses. The burden is not widely shared, with some NATO countries to spend more than 3 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), while others remain below the base line of 2 percent, ”says IISS, in a statement.
In real terms, the European defense expense has grown 50 percent in nominal terms in the last decade, according to the 2025 Military Balance, which every year makes an assessment of military capabilities and the worldwide defense economy.
The study includes updated data on military structures, equipment inventories and defense budgets from more than 170 countries.
IISS estimates that an increase to 3 percent of GDP of all European NATO members would grow the amount more than $ 250 billion and almost $ 750 billion if the 5 percent value was reached, as it reached Suggest US President Donald Trump.
"However, these values ​​are unattainable at this time, with some countries resorting to extra-organizational instruments to reinforce budgets," the British Study Center acknowledges. As for the US, although this country spends in defense 3.39 percent of GDP, “limitations are evident in its industrial defense base” due to the need for investment and modernization, he says.
Complicated accounts
The IISS estimates that Russia's military expenses increased 41.9 percent by 2024, overloading the budget for the equivalent of 6.7 percent of GDP, which is higher than the total of the European expense with the defense in terms of parity of the Purchase power.
However, it states that the Russian economy remains resilient thanks to revenues from non -energetic sources, which allow you to maintain a reduced budget deficit and central bank measures.
According to the military balance, it is increasingly difficult to quantify the Russian expense with the defense due to financing by regional entities, private companies and even families, which pay equipment and basic provisions. About China, IISS accounts for internal reorganization and reforms to make the military structure more efficient, namely through the fight against corruption, investigation and increased capacities, namely equipment.
The Chinese budget in 2024 was estimated at about $ 235 billion, an increase of 7 percent compared to 2023 and an amount equivalent to 44 percent of total expenditure in Asia.</description><pubDate>2025-02-13 01:42:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Vocational Education | Alert Study for Human Resources Failures in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/ensino-profissional-estudo-alerta-para-falhas-em-recursos-humanos-na-china/</link><description>A study published in The China Quarterly concludes that there are still many questions to resolve so that technical-professional education in China can respond to human resources needs. The work warns of the “rapid massification” of this type of education, with priority for “number of enrollment over quality”
 
Technical-professional education in China has been popularized, but a recently published study in Cambridge University Press magazine “The China Quarterly”, concludes that there are still gaps to find that courses can actually respond to needs of the country in terms of labor in the industrial sector.
“More Graduates, Fewer Skills? Vocational Education Expansion and Skilled Labar Shortages in China ”[More graduates, less skills? The expansion of vocational education and qualified labor faults in China] is the name of the study developed by Xinmiao Song of the University of Lingnan, and Duudo XU of the University of Hong Kong Department of Sociology.
Academic work draws attention to the “disturbing trend” of “rapid massification of vocational education, which gives priority to the number of enrollments to the detriment of the quality of education” and that “does not respond to the search for skills and hand-based training qualified work ”.
In addition, the authors add to the “adverse consequences for both administrative management and teaching, caused by this scenario. “The development of competences often is up to post-school professional associations and an exclusive group of elite students. However, reform initiatives, such as the Manual Arts Campaign and competency contests, benefit only a few, without improving the prospects of employment of the student population in general. ”
Thus, the two academics argue that “more attention to the tensions inherent to China's teaching and vocational training system”, because “only when there is a deeper understanding of the underlying causes to the ineffective training of competences in vocational schools China can achieve its national objective of industrial modernization ”.
The study was developed in two vocational schools, and interviews were conducted to 104 students. In addition, ethnographic data of four doctoral projects were used in the area of ​​vocational education, developed between October 2017 and December 2020.
It is also noted that the country needs “increasingly urgent” of qualified workers “due to world economic competition”. However, "despite the massive expansion of the teaching and vocational training system in the last two decades, there is still a significant deficit of qualified labor," there is "debates about the ineffectiveness of vocational education." These focus above all on, “in the absence of institutional synergies between teaching and industry, but they often ignore the conflicts inherent to the vocational education system and the processes of competency training at the micro level”.
Practical difficulties
To the “micro level”, that is, in schools, the authors denote the existence of several difficulties in the effective functioning of these courses in line with the intended results.
In secondary education there is “a delicate balance between the promotion of social equality and the development of skills”. However, "analysis indicates that, in the context of the rapid expansion of secondary education, schools have difficulty effectively harmonizing these objectives."
“In order to maintain a proper student body, schools and teachers are often obliged to compromise the quality of candidates and teaching standards in the classroom. This situation generates a change in daily pedagogy and school administration to preserve discipline and stability, thus attributing the development of skills and the selection of talents-ideally a mission from the whole school-to extra-curricular professional associations, pursued Just for a few, ”is added.
It is also concluded that “the acquisition of competences is a multifaceted process, shaped by the dynamic interaction between educators and students”, because “the academic preparation of students and their motivations to learn are equally pertinent for the formation of microcompetences, such as the These are the resources of schools and the capabilities of teachers. ”
Thus, “the resolution of the ineffective formation of competencies requires more than the top -to -base initiatives”, “an approach that recognizes the obstacles that students face in the acquisition of skills, as well as their seizures and uncertainties, is necessary. In search of a job ”, it is mentioned.
The authors also talk about “elitism” in some formations related to handicraft courses and “competency contests”. "These initiatives may inadvertently suggest that handicrafts are reserved for a restricted number of people, as competencies contests often remain inaccessible to most vocational education students, both objective and psychologically."
Thus, the authors emphasize that "there is a significant undoing between this elitist approach to the acquisition of competences and the real conditions faced by vocational education students."
“The superficial promotion of manual labor spirit and the exclusivity of skills failed to truly resolve the challenges associated with the acquisition of skills, the search for employment and the commitment to follow technical professions among vocational education students,” is also mentioned.
Still, limitations in the study are referred to, namely the fact that it focuses only on public schools in higher secondary education, and the results may not completely represent other levels of vocational education, such as the higher institutes of vocational training ”.

Numbers from the “Factory of the World”
In the study is the intense industrial development that China has achieved in the last 40 years, emerging as the "factory of the world," as the authors describe, "taking advantage of their demographic dividends."
“However, the labor-intensive growth model has proved unsustainable due to population aging and intense global competition. To escape the 'trap of medium income', the Chinese government has launched a series of industrial modernization actions in the transforming industry and services sectors, ”but“ despite the ambitious agendas for the next decade, the persistent scarcity of qualified workers continues to hinder these efforts, ”is referred to.
By 2020, there were more than 23 million students of vocational education, so “this scarcity of skilled labor is a surprise”, is referred to in the study, which highlights “the substantial efforts and resources that the Chinese government dedicated to Improvement of vocational education in recent years ”.
For example, “Free Secondary Professional Education, the expansion of higher vocational facilities in one million students from 2019 to 2021 and the creation of universities of applied technology” emerged. In addition, the vocational education system watched an unprecedented trajectory, with enrollment in secondary professional schools higher than increasing from 4.56 million in 2004 to 7.11 million in 2009 ″.
In terms of the need for human resources, the study cites data from China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security for 80 cities in the country. “The ministry's quarterly reports revealed that the workfold/person who seeks skilled labor reached a historical peak of 2.0 in early 2020”, and “higher-level qualified workers, technicians and the upper technicians had a particularly high demand. ”
It is also noted that the Ministry of Education provides that the country continues to confront this year “with a deficit of 30 million qualified workers, which represents a 48 percent break in domains such as materials, the savings of energy and vehicles powered by new energies ”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:25:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Pecunaries Checks | An economic "comfort" that has generated debate</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/cheques-pecuniarios-um-conforto-economico-que-tem-gerado-debate/</link><description>The pecuniary reimbursement program started in 2008 to distribute the fruits of the development of MSAR by residents. However, he returned to the agenda the possibility of leaving outside those who do not live in Macau. Sonny Lo describes the measure as an economic "comfort", while José Félix Pontes says that altering politics entails "courage"
 
Every year permanent and non-permanent residents, whether they have many or few economic possessions, receive, respectively, ten thousand patacas and six thousand government patacas. A check that is obtained only because it has a resident identity card, whether or not resident in Macao. According to the government, the objective of the pecuniary reimbursement program has always been the sharing of the economic success of the territory with the population, obtained largely with the taxes charged on the game.
However, in recent weeks there are no shortage of voices, especially in the Legislative Assembly (AL), asking those who live outside Macao stop receiving the check. The issue was once again discussed yesterday on the Macao Chinese Macao Forum Program of Macau, with Nelson Kot, president of the Macao Social Synthetic Studies Association, to argue that the checks should be attributed through the performance of the various social classes. Thus, the values ​​would be different.
“Some elderly do not have many income and depend on the reform to live. If this group of people receives a higher value check, your life can improve. If you consider the principle of social justice, the government should consider the form of distribution of pecuniary checks depending on the various social classes, taking advantage of ways to increase the rights of some groups, ”he said.
Lei Chun Kwok, vice president of the Macao Economic Association of Macau also participated in the program, recalling that when the checks were launched in 2008, the local economy suffered from the impact of this year's worldwide crisis, so the check-to-check was intended to support to support population dealing with increased inflation.
Then, in the pandemic, he remembered Lei Chun Kwok, eventually constituted another support, given the attribution of checks in advance. Also academic at the University of Macau recalled that for residents who do not live in Macau, the potential of these checks to stimulate consumption is limited. “Given the economic perspective, if the holders of the checks that live abroad only deposit them in bank accounts, saving all the money, this does not benefit the general interests of Macao, because money does not enter the economic system or help to create economic activities. ”
Leong in Pong, Deputy Chief of the Social Affairs Council of the General Union of Macao Residents Associations (Ugamm), also defended in the same program as residents, to receive the checks, should live in Macau at least 183 days a year, as a rule too imposed on the beneficiaries of the non-obligatory central social security regime, as well as to renew the non-permanent BIR.
50 percent in vouchers
For economist José Félix Pontes, there should be no short -term changes in politics. “For the future years, and in the assumption that the government will maintain the measure (which I defend), it should be restricted [the attribution] to those who live in the MGre, at least 183 days in each year, followed by the Criteria of 'tax resident' of MSAR, ”he suggested to HM.
However, the economist understands that exceptions should be created, if the limitation advances, namely for “Macao students who study abroad, or permanent residents treated in hospital establishments in China or abroad for long periods, or teachers who teach in institutions teaching outside Macao ”.
It is also suggested by this economist that the amount of each check should be attributed to two components, namely half in check and half in “voucher” format, “so that they can be used exclusively in commercial establishments on the masters”.
However, José Félix Pontes considers that "it will be difficult to change the situation and it will always be a measure that the Government of the MSAR will have to reveal political determination and courage."
For analyst Sonny Lo, checks leave "a sense of comfort among residents and, ideally, should continue, even if the amount can be reduced a little in annual terms." The checks thus represent "a welfare factor that has led to political and social satisfaction in Macao."
If there are changes, Sonny Lo does not predict social disturbance, since "in Macao people are politically very calm and give relative support to the government."
Focus Objectives
Let's look at the numbers: In 2008, the first year of launching the pecuniary reimbursement program, checks were given to 534,672 residents, in the global value of 2,545 million patacas; Since the beneficiaries are about 750,000, which causes an annual expense for the administration of 7.5 billion patacas.
For José Félix Pontes, the question of the beneficiaries is not new, because “since the beginning of the distribution of these checks that has been questioned if it should be limited only to those who are actually living permanently in the MSAR, or if it should include, Regardless of the effective place of residence, any and all permanent resident ticket or non-permanent resident ticket. ”
“Also the issue of the 'income level' of each resident has been questioned, and there are those who argue that these checks should have the beneficiaries resident with lower income, or that they were from staggered amounts depending on their income. Finally, the eventual attribution of checks to 'blue card workers' (non-resident workers) has been very 'soft', from time to time, as they also contribute, in various sectors, to The development of Macau's economy, ”he recalled.
The truth is that, in resurgence of this debate, the possible inclusion of TNR, for example, was never directly considered. Deputy Ron Lam has been one of the advocates of changes to the pecuniary reimbursement program, and the government should clarify whether the measure is financial support or distribution of dividends. The deputy said that there are currently about 100,000 residents living outside Macao. Ron Lam also said that, according to data from the budgetary proposals for the 2025 economic year, the government spared 79.32 million patacas with checks that were not deposited within three years. The deputy defended a survey of the reasons so that these checks were not deposited or raised. Also, Mrs Lo Choi in defended the end of the checks for those outside Macao.
José Félix Pontes understands that it is time to think about the true objective of this policy. “The objective defined for the distribution of pecuniary checks has to be present, which consisted of sharing with the resident population of the financial success in the evolution of the economy, which is indissolibly linked to the government's revenues in the game tax . Hence talking about the distribution of the dividends of the game. However, the measure has to be seen not only as a sharing of economic gains, but also, and to some extent, as a reinforcement of the social security of MSAR residents or promoting the local economy. ”
HM questioned a resident of Macao, of Portuguese nationality, who did not want to be identified, and left the territory about a year ago, currently living in Portugal. However, the resident has already considered a possible return to the territory. About checks, it says it is important to analyze the intentions of the executive.
“If the idea of ​​the checks is to distribute the richness of the casinos to the people of Macao, to the people who are residents, it makes no sense to end them, because people continue to have a 'rib' of Macao in some way. If the perspective is this altruism, then it makes no sense to stop the checks for those who are outside. If the question is there is a reward, there is different. What checks are what, after all? Are not the distribution of wealth to the people of Macao? Or if you contribute to Macau receive a reward? This is the central question. If it is to distribute the richness of the casinos everyone is entitled. ”
The resident highlights the example of a person who all life lived in Macao, renovated himself and went to another country for "several reasons, even health." “It is important to know this kind of cases. But the key is to know what the pecuniary check is and what it is for. I have always been told to me it was the distribution of wealth, ”he said.</description><pubDate>2025-02-13 00:24:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Study | Reluctant government in legislating vital will</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/11/estudo-governo-relutante-em-legislar-testamento-vital/</link><description>A study by Man Teng Iong, professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Macao, and Vera Lúcia Raposo draws attention to the absence of the “anticipated directive of will”, or vital will, of the legal system of masters. The document allows a person to decide previously whether or not to receive medical treatments in the terminal phase of life
 
For several years in Portugal any citizen can sign an Early Directive of Will (DAV), also known as the Vital Testament, which allows the conscious decision on the type of medical treatments to receive in a given health context. Being far from constituting a legal form of euthanasia, the document allows to know the patient's will when he, for health reasons, cannot do so.
In Macao, the DAV is not legislated and the authorities have revealed signs of reluctance to advance in the process. This is what the study concludes “Advance Directives in Macao: Not Legally Recognissed, but. . . ” [DAV in Macao: No legal recognition, but… ”, signed by Man Teng Iong, professor at the University of Macao Law School (one), and Vera Lúcia Raposo, former director of the same faculty and currently a teacher at the Faculty of Law from the New University of Lisbon. The study was recently published by Cambridge University Press, although it was the theme of Man Teng Iong's master's thesis defended a few years ago.
The authors analyze the legal framework of the issue in Macao, concluding that “to date, the Macao Executive assumed a precautionary attitude towards the DAV, accepting (or tolerating) these instruments, but not investigating this subject with the necessary force” .
"It has been reported that, due to the aging of the population of Macao, and in the light of the adoption of DAV legislation in the last twenty years in countries such as the United States, Australia, Canada and Singapore, the executive recognized the need to legislate DAV." , it is added.
The authors indicate that local authorities even recognize the positive factors of accessing this type of legal document. “Such legal instruments will not only increase quality of life and protect patients' dignity at the end of their lives, but also reduce unnecessary medical expenses. On December 3, 2019, Health Services (SS), and the sub -entity of the Life Science Ethics Committee, introduced the 'guidelines and future policy of the DAV' in Macao, agreeing to legitimize [a matter]. However, despite the agreement around the implementation of DAV, the executive insists on maintaining a preliminary discussions around DAV. ”
Thus, the authors consider that "hesitation may reflect the fear of the [SS] in facing difficulties and controversies around the plans for its implementation."
Consensus as an argument
The authors point out that the “barriers to the implementation” of the DAV legal framework in Macao arise “from a low conscience from the public in the face of DAV legislation and the possibility of patients can change the way of facing the end of life, well as the arrangement of the patient's family members to fulfill the patient's wishes ”.
The study stresses that the SS have always argued that “an extensive and profound action of sensitization and education with the public has been done in academic, social and legal areas whenever necessary, and that the law that regulates DAV can only be implemented later obtained the consensus of all sectors ”.
However, the study states that “it is possible to argue that the position of the executive lacks proper justification”, because “this type of consensus invoked to postpone the regulation of DAV is not possible to achieve, due to the multiplicity of legal, ethical visions and even religious about matter ”. In addition, the authors point out that "even if such a consensus could be achieved, the executive did not take the necessary steps to encourage or facilitate discussion, or awareness, with the population."
Data on a study made about the notions of the population of Macao on the subject are referred to, concluding that "the lack of information about the DAV was the main determining factor in the decision of people to make the DAV."
"The study also found that 73.6 percent of the sample (724 people) were willing to complete a DAV if the document had legal recognition."
Social and political “resistance”
Thus, the study's authors warn of the existence of “a great resistance - from certain groups of residents of Macao and the Executive - for the implementation of adequate DAV regulation”. "A possible reason for this hesitation is to the fear that formally legislating DAV can lead to euthanasia, a forbidden practice in Macau, even if the two situations are clearly different," the authors say, who understand to be "imperative that the executive regulates the DAV ”.
At this specific point, a new law should “clarify some legal aspects, such as the requirements for the [DAV] and to be legally operational”, ensuring the patient's decision autonomy and ensuring “a more appropriate solution from the point of view of the point of view human rights ”.
The authors draw attention to the influence of Portuguese law of 2012 on the DAV legislation in Macao, drawing attention to the fact that DAV have a greater compatibility with what is currently in the local Civil Code.
However, legislating the DAV also causes a cultural discussion, is pointed out. “It is unclear whether DAV regulation would be in agreement with the widespread values ​​of the predominant Chinese community, which still has a great connection to the family. More studies are needed to clarify this and other subjects, since, for example, there are no data on numbers estimates and implementation of DAV in the jurisdiction of Macao ”, and there is“ an urgent need for further investigations that exploit perspectives of the doctors around the DAV ”.
The case of the Kiang Wu Hospital, which at the “The Hospice &amp; Palliative Care Center” palliative care center provides treatment for cancer terminal patients. However, before the admission of these patients, the signing of the document “Consent for the Hospice &amp; Palliative Care Center” is required, a kind of consent that is mostly signed by family members and not by the patient himself. In addition, "it is not an authorization document by patients, or not, of medical procedures, but an acceptance of hospital terms and conditions."
What current law allows
In general terms, DAV in Macau have some legal framework, namely in the Civil Code, although they are not legislated with their own law. The authors conclude, however, that "there is some uncertainty about to what extent DAV would be effective, in particular given that doctors tend to reject any document that rejects a support and life maintenance treatment."
“In Macau the discussion around the DAV is almost nonexistent. Without a clear and transparent debate that includes specialists and studies with legal arguments, there will be no legal developments related to the nature, content and use of DAV in the near future, ”he describes.</description><pubDate>2025-02-11 23:58:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Artificial Intelligence | Study highlights China's leadership goal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/11/inteligencia-artificial-estudo-destaca-meta-de-lideranca-da-china/</link><description>China aims to lead the global market of artificial intelligence, “both in terms of theory and application”, seeking self-sufficiency in this domain. This is one of the conclusions of Muhammed Can's PhD Thesis, “Artificial Intelligence as a resource: an evaluation of China's mobilization and extraction strategies”, defended at the University of Minho
 
A few months before the launch of the “DeepSeek” platform in China, which revolutionized the Artificial Intelligence (AI) market in competition with the chatgPT, was defended at the University of Minho (one) a doctoral thesis that precisely concludes, the ones Steps Beijing is taking to seek global leadership in this area. The work, by Muhammed Can, calls “Artificial Intelligence as Resource: An Appraraisal of China's Mobilization and Extraction Strategies” [Artificial Intelligence as a resource: an evaluation of China's mobilization and extraction strategies], and analyzes the connection of the He went to international relations, as well as the strategy that the country has adopted in this domain in recent years. The thesis, in the area of ​​political science and international relations, was defended at the school of Economics and Management of UM.
Thus, it is concluded that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) “aims to become the world leader in both theory and AI-applications”, and some main objectives were outlined for “the process of resource mobilization and development AI ”. According to the author, they go through the “search for self-sufficiency, a view of 2015 strategy, 'Made in China 2025 ′”, as well as “economic transformation, with a view to perfectly integrating AI and automation in the national economy perfectly ”.
Moreover, the author considers that Beijing seeks to become a competitor and leader in the AI ​​area to combat advances in other markets, namely in the United States, using initiatives such as the “Digital Silk Route of China and definition efforts of patterns as the way for external validation ”.
Thus, "China's external resource extraction strategies are facilitated by the various economic mechanisms, aiming at the transfer of knowledge and talent acquisition, with the aim of filling out the resource gap with the United States."
The “techno-nationalism”
The thesis also speaks of the notion of “techno-nationalism”, linked to the area of ​​international relations, such as “the most important variable in China's IA policy”, and can also “be seen as a continuation and manifestation of the strategy of ' Two markets, two features' of the CCP ”.
With this approach, China intends to "protect the domestic market and, simultaneously, expand abroad, promote the sale of products manufactured in China and extract resources such as data, talent, know-how and many others."
In addition, “the implications of techno-nationalism also extend to foreign technological companies that operate in China”, since, “in the context of ordinary companies, China uses several barriers and takes advantage of its national legal framework as an instrument for an instrument for the strategic transfer of technology and specialized knowledge ”.
Academic work takes into account the policies and laws implemented between 2012 and 2023, concluding that after the launch of the “New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan” [NAIDP, in the English acronym], in 2017, the Chinese strategy for AI Won a new direction. "The thesis shows that the pace to which the resources were mobilized increased sharply after the announcement of NAIDP in 2017", having been revealed a set of "initiatives and plans related to AI, intended for systematic mobilization of essential resources for the development of I was ”.
In the years referring to the study, “the CCP has enacted a series of data related policies and laws, including laws related to the privacy of individual data”, introducing “legal frameworks specifically related to national security, which have direct implications for governance and data regulation ”.
The author also describes the way Beijing has adopted to mobilize all resources available around AI policy, with the Council of State “promulgating comprehensive strategic plans pertinent to AI or AI -related matters - such as the action plan Triennial Internet + Artificial Intelligence ”. It is these documents that will “articulate short and long term goals and standards, serving as a course for a coordinated development in this field”. The essential resources in the development of AI projects and policies are "data, algorithms and computing capacity."
It should be noted that there is a “CCP resource mobilization strategy” that has the “approach of 'whole society' and 'whole government'”. Such "implies that all segments of society, including government institutions, private companies and individuals, may be involved in AI development effort if it is considered necessary." It is, according to the thesis, “an integrated approach that allows a more cohesive and comprehensive strategy for the mobilization of resources in the context of AI development”.
After “the introduction of global strategies”, the CCP “begins the process of mobilization of resources through designated government institutions”, namely Ministries, the AI ​​promotion office and the China Cyberspace Administration ”.
“To improve its resource mobilization strategy, the CCP actively incorporates private actors in the AI ​​development ecosystem. By designating certain large technological companies such as AI national champions, the government not only mobilizes these companies, but also encourages them to mobilize more resources according to the state's strategic objectives ”, it reads.
Importance of local governments
Like in other fields, China realized early on that AI was an important area to invest and would have to be part of economic and political strategies. Thus, Muhammed Can's thesis "demonstrates that CCP changes in technological policy are closely aligned with the strategic environment," as the party "has realized opportunities and threats in significant global developments."
Still regarding the mobilization of resources for the development of AI, the author speaks of a process “complex and distributed instead of a singular approach, from top to bottom, led only by the CCP or the State Council”.
“Although the CCP establishes the general rules and guidelines, it actively involves a wide range of stakeholders - including companies, universities and ministerial bodies - in the mobilization process. This distributed strategy can be understood in the context of China's size, both in terms of population and geographical extension, which requires a more dispersed approach. ”
The author highlights the “preponderant role that local governments play in the development of AI”, as “they function as extensions of the central authority, and their active involvement implies direct mobilization of resources”, namely at the level of algorithms and computing capacity.
"The thesis concludes that local governments have also instituted various strategies to improve policies associated with data, algorithms and computing capacity," can be read. “Some local governments have taken the initiative to formulate their own AI strategies before the central authorities issued official guidelines. Subsequently, these local strategies were reviewed to conform to the central directives. ” To analyze local AI policies, the author analyzed the cases of Shanghai and Shenzhen.
Moreover, the idea of ​​mobilization around the AI ​​area is attached with historical issues, as Beijing has always sought the avant-garde in the technology area, namely since the Cold War times. As read in the thesis, “China began to rely heavily on exported technology from the Soviet Union after the creation of the Popular Republic of China”, but “the restrictive strategic environment began to evolve with the historic visit of US President Richard Nixon , in 1972 ”, having represented" an invaluable opportunity for China and the US counterbalances the Soviet threat. "
Thanks to archive research, the author concludes that "China's strategic environment has moved to a partially permissive state around 1978, coinciding with the beginning of the reform and opening policies of leader Deng Xiaoping." From this year onwards, “a dramatic expansion of opportunities for the CCP in the field of technological development”. In general terms, "the concept of mobilization is intrinsically linked to the role of longtime vanguard of the CCP, a role that facilitated the rapid mobilization of resources during key moments of its history."
Not on purpose, China has participated since yesterday at the Summit about AI that takes place in Paris, the AI ​​action summit, having sent Deputy Prime Minister Zhang Quoqing. In this summit, which ends today, “heads of state, researchers and technology companies that will discuss how governments should respond to rapid advances in this domain are present,” according to Lusa.</description><pubDate>2025-02-11 02:52:36</pubDate></item><item><title>ATFPM | Elections scheduled for October 26</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/atfpm-eleicoes-agendadas-para-26-de-outubro/</link><description>The Association of Macao Public Function Workers (ATFPM) scheduled the elections to choose a new direction to October 26.

Law Chan U intends that the government will make a situation of the progress of the work of the 3rd five-year plan of the MSAR (2026-2030), which is expected to take effect next year. The subject is addressed in a written interpeação shared yesterday by the office of the deputy linked to the Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom).
In 2015, the MSAR began to follow the interior model of China that every five years has a plan on the development of society for five years. The deputy defends this option and justifies that the “elaboration of a five -year plan helps to build a future development model and to define the objectives of economic and social development”.
In view of the importance it assigns to the plan, Chan U considers that it is necessary that the Directorate of Policy Study and Regional Development Services (DSEPDR) will update the work for the future program and to indicate when they will start the preparation work.
On the other hand, the Faom deputy intends that the executive will make a situation of the plan currently in force the 2nd five-year plan of the MSAR (2020-2025), which is in the last year of validity. “When the government is expected to start reviewing and completing the effectiveness of the five -year period?” He asks.
Among the deputy's concerns is also the need for “perfect convergence” between the end of the plan currently in force and the beginning of the future plan.
The Role of the Island
Throughout the question, law chan u virtually does not refer to content that I would like to see in the plan. However, he wants to know if part of the plan will aim at the deepened cooperation zone between Macau and Guangdong and where cooperation will follow “the spirit of Xi Jinping's speeches”, given at the time in Macao, during December of the year past.
Regarding the XI's speeches, law also argues that the “government must follow these instructions and take specific measures in the elaboration of the third five -year plan”.
At the same time, the Faom legislator argues that the 3rd five -year plan of the MSAR should be articulated with 15th Fivenote Plan of the Popular Republic of China and follow the example of what is done “successfully” within China.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:31:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Employment | Seminar makes known technological industry to young people</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/emprego-seminario-da-a-conhecer-industria-tecnologica-a-jovens/</link><description>A little over a week ago, the government and Macau Youth Development Service Center organized the seminar “The Future of the Macao Technology Industry”, which aimed to help Macao young people know the job opportunities offered by the local technology industry.

Considering “incredible” the way the disclosure was made, Johnson Ian, who is partner of Deputy Ron Lam, argues that there are stories that have to be announced in another way
 
Executive head, Sam Hou Fai, announced the team of secretaries with which he will work in the coming years through a statement, without the right to a press conference or other additional explanations, which led Johson Ian, former candidate for the Legislative Assembly ( Al), classifying this action as “amazing”.
The former journalist and also president of the Macau Synergy Association, which is linked to Deputy Ron Lam U Tou, told the All About Macau newspaper that the form adopted by the executive to communicate policies through communications is “unidirectional”, unable to explain fully the questions to the population.
Johson Ian also warned that, on social networks, there are voices to doubt the new governing leadership, because there is not much “movement” of public actions and comments after the inauguration.
In the opinion of the official, if the government continues to communicate with the population simply through communications, this can impair their image and credibility.
"Macau has many problems that cannot be explained only through communications," he said. For Johson Ian, if Sam Hou Fai and the secretaries remain silent, it is certain that department heads and other subordinates will not make public statements either. This can cause a disconnection with society, he defended.
Fewer limitations
The new executive took office on December 20, but only communicated to announce the visits made in community neighborhoods with Sam Hou Fai and other members of the governance team. In addition, and according to Johnson Ian, no interviews were accepted on the fringes of activities and visits to associations.
Only Tai Kin IP, secretary for the economy and finance, answered simply to the questions posed by journalists on February 1, after another visit with the chief executive.
Thus, Johnson Ian suggests that the government will end the limitations of access to some media that, since October, are not allowed to enter some government services, with the argument that there is not enough space for all.
"Whenever it is said that there is limitation of space, the images show that there are many empty chairs, which demonstrates that it is a lie," said Johnson Ian.
The official said that there is currently a greater diversity in the local media, as it is not limited to publishing on paper, also using social networks and digital platforms to make content and information, such as others media around the world. Thus, the president of the Association considers that the MSAR also has to follow this trend in order to welcome the visions of the media, rather than limiting them in their action.
Johnson Ian presented the cases of some rulers from Europe, USA and Hong Kong who resort to social networks to give public explanations and comment on various issues, also understanding that the current practices of the Macao government can no longer achieve the objectives they are proposed. For Johnson Ian, it is no longer enough to publicize press release to reproduce in traditional media, given the fewer readers or viewers compared to digital platforms.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:28:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Casinos | MP asks for more breaks between shifts</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/17/casinos-deputada-pede-mais-pausas-entre-turnos/</link><description>Representative Song Pek Kei argues that the government should encourage changes in casinos working hours, namely with the introduction of more shift breaks in order to promote a better work environment and more employment -looking stability.

Without specifying what measures will be taken, the government highlights the success of the Grand Prix for Consumption and the importance of the organization of sports and cultural events in the neighborhoods
 
The Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) is “reviewing and evaluating” the effectiveness of consumption promotion activities in community neighborhoods. Without specifying exactly that trade incentive measures in residential areas, outside the tourist circuits, will be implemented, DSEDT director Yau Yun Wah begins by highlighting the results of the great consumption award.
The discount coupons distribution campaign was attended by more than 22,000 stores, including retail restoration and sale. For 13 weeks, about 227 million patacas were used in coupons, generating a total consumption of 1.1 billion patacas, the DSEDT director said in response to a written interpellation of Ella Law.
For now, the body is auscultation “opinions of various sectors”, to study the launch of more consumer promotion activities in community neighborhoods, and ensures that it will continue to cooperate with the different industrial and commercial associations of the territory.
However, the executive points out that the economy can be stimulated in other ways, as well as direct financial support. The organization of tourist and cultural events in residential neighborhoods can be alternative solutions.
In this domain, Yau Yun Wah indicates that the Directorate of Tourism Services is committed to collaborating with the dealers to extend to the community neighborhoods “Brand Emblematic Activities”, such as the Lunar New Year celebrations, the International Festival of Macau Gastronomy cities , the International Contest of Fire-of-Fire and the Light Festival.
In addition, the government will support activities that bring tourists to these areas, such as the “Coastal Fantasia: The Lobster King's Vacation In Macao” and Philip Colbert's Macao Art Tour ”, shows to Macao by Sands China.

The government also refers to three financial support programs to associations that carry out tourism activities, combining community resources and local stores. For 2025, 43 activities were approved, which the government estimates involving more than 2,000 commercial establishments and could count with the participation of 2.2 million people.
The DSEDT director also mentions as an example to follow sports events involving community neighborhoods, such as the car exhibition at Tap Seac Square during the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix and the visits of tennis players to the neighborhoods during the Macau Tennis Masters last year.</description><pubDate>2025-02-17 00:46:54</pubDate></item><item><title>CEPA II | Changes discussed this Wednesday</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/17/cepa-ii-alteracoes-discutidas-esta-quarta-feira/</link><description>The Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) holds this Wednesday a clarification session on the changes to the “Commerce of Services Agreement” in Cepa II (Student of the Strength of Economic and Commercial Relations between the interior of China and Macau).

The contents of the new law are simple, but from an operational point of view, there are many issues that deserve to be discussed.
The two main questions are as follows, in the first place, neither infrastructors nor their legal guardians are not penalized in the light of the new law, the penalty is only about companies that generate social networks. This approach can lead to disputes on the attribution of responsibility when put into practice.
Secondly, the new law requires companies that generate social networks to take measures to verify the age of users. However, the new law clearly stipulates that users cannot carry in these platforms the identification documents, which makes the correct determination of their age difficult. A goal spokesman has stated that Facebook respects Australian law, but is concerned about the process adopted, as it considers that the law was accelerated to ensure the interdiction of children's access to social networks without being heard to the different opinions on the subject.
Since currently there is no more effective method to prevent children from using social networks, to solve the problem, the Australian government has stated that it would adopt the “age certification system”. It is planned to invite 1,200 Australian citizens to take an age evaluation test, and a consulting firm will implement recommendations in the middle of this year. This will be one of the largest tests with age assessment technology ever performed. If successful, it will become an important reference indicator for legislative agencies and technological platforms around the world to detect the age of users of social networks. It will be a highly representative global model and will be congratulated.
But if it fails, will Australia have an alternative plan to enforce the new law? Although not mentioned in the news, from the point of view of public administration, it would be complicated to have a completely new computer system of unknown effectiveness to deal with the social problems arising from the access of children under 16 to social networks, the which is undoubtedly a risk. If prepared for both scenarios Australia will be easier to implement the new law.
When it is necessary to verify the age of the users, the most effective method is through the presentation of identity cards, passports, etc. In Australia this method is not legal, possibly because photos and identification data are personal information and involve privacy protection issues. When companies that generate social networks receive accurate information, they can correctly determine the age of users, but at the same time, as they have access to many data from users, they have to treat them carefully. In light of the new law, companies that generate social networks can avoid these problems because they will not have to process the personal data of users, and they do not need to worry about the possibility of their data being disclosed, stolen or sold by third parties .
Moreover, in relation to the practical and operational aspects of the new law, there is another issue that is concerned with online game. The children under 16 are students of basic education. Young people in this age group have no self-control and self-preservation capacity yet and easily addicted to the online universe. They are very dependent on social networking platforms and online games. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that excessive use of social networks is a risk to the physical and mental health of children and that legislation should be introduced to control this risk. If Australia has passed legislation to protect the physical and mental health of children under 16, is the next step prevent them from playing online?
On October 25, 2019, the management of the Press and Publications of Continental China issued the “National Press Administration Warning and Publications for Prevention of Addiction in Online Games among the Minors”, stipulating that all online game companies can only Have games available on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. These days, the games are available for one hour from 20.00 to 21.00, and no service will be available at other times. This regulation was actually applied in mainland China.
On the other hand, South Korea passed a law in 2011 to restrict access from under 16 to online play between 22.30 and 6.00, but the law was very contested and was eventually repealed because it did not respect the rights of younger people .
The new Australian law recognizes the risks that social networks pose for children's physical and mental health. If young people start using social networks too early, they are subject to adverse consequences such as depression, harassment, anxiety and weak academic results. If you continue to evolve into “internet addiction”, it will be even more serious and inevitable to legislate. The question of restricting children's access to online games can be seen as continuing the restriction of children's access to social networks and can be treated in the same way. The experience of mainland China in this area may be valuable to other countries.
Hong Kong and Macao currently have no legislation that regulates access from under 16 to social networks or online game platforms. Do we need legislation to regulate these issues? The new Australian law is a warning to remind us of this problem. What should we do? Each of these regions can conduct an in -depth investigation and decide according to their conclusions.
Next week we will have a new theme.

Poorly comparative was what happened to Finance Minister Miranda Sarmento, against his infrastructure and housing counterpart, Miguel Pinto Luz, in the case of suspension of income allowance to more than 80,000 people living in trouble. Without any notice, the Tax and Customs Authority versus finance, with all cruelty, suspended the income subsidy of about 200 euros, a measure decreed by the previous government for a period of five years and began in 2023.
Minister Pinto Luz, who has the protection of the Institute of Housing and Urban Rehabilitation (IHRU) - an institution that was limited to pay according to the green light received by finances during the last two years - was obliged, confronted by deputies in the Assembly of the Republic, apologizing to the injured. Who had to apologize to the Portuguese affected with such ungrateful measure was the Minister of Finance. Obviously, the injured injured revolt fell on top of Ihru who was not even prepared for such a significant contestation and doesn't even have enough employees to face lines of people who have been at the door of IHRU. service for hours standing.
Prime Minister Luís Montenegro has claimed to all the winds that governs for people. We think your people are friends and compadres, because the millions of poor people in our country of certainty that they do not fit into their governance. It was very evident for those who Montenegro rules. On January 1, 2023, its predecessor António Costa took one of the most human and supportive measures of Portuguese politics in democracy.
It decreed that about 200,000 poor, families who lived in great survival difficulties and who could not pay home income, began to enjoy for five years of approximate income of 200 euros, to help pay income. , after the finances they find through the IRs which citizens need to help, which came to happen automatically. Now we have watched, without any notice, to the government cut of this income subsidy to more than 85,000 people. These people, who had this sin to make the income payment and who, once again, were missing before their landlords. A measure full of cruelty and inhumanity.
The Institute of Housing and Urban Rehabilitation (IHRU) knew perfectly perfectly that the State Budget has captivated the amount of 300 million euros for the payment of income subsidies to about 200 thousand poor Portuguese. The institute would never admit that this case would happen without warning in advance. Even so, the finances did not curb the infamy of cutting the income subsidy so necessary for thousands of unprotected Portuguese. The IHRU, which was the paying institution, was immediately targeted by the greatest criticism in the media and the Assembly of the Republic, where a deputy vented to be a "cretinice".
In the face of the protests, IHRU issued a statement indicating that from the beginning of last week, people who were impaired would have an application on the IHRU website where they could confirm their income data from the Finance Portal and insert their own complaint. This application was not made available to the vast majority of injuries and IHRU was forced to turn off its only phone number where people could request information about what had happened to their income subsidies due to the large avalanche of calls telephone calls .
The infamous decision of the finance covered Portuguese throughout the national territory. However, the almost general injured man had no solution vector and, in Lisbon, injured ones began to know that the only solution would be personally moving to the IHRU premises near Spain's square in order to be attended to the problem.
It should be noted that among the despised people and stolen by the government, include citizens and citizens who are invisual, disabled, old and who are all impossible to go to the IHRU headquarters. No longer talking about the thousands of injuries who do not have any internet access, who have no computer to be able to consult the IHRU website or the finance portal, which encloses total contempt for these people.
A very poor, 79-year-old, resident in the Moscavide neighborhood, without internet access, was advised to personally move to IHRU headquarters. The citizen left home at 07.00 hours, picked up the train at East Station to Roma-Areiro, moved along three lines of the metropolitan, green, red and blue, rose dozens of stairs because the rollingmen and elevators they were damaged. He felt bad and sat on a bench in the garden of Spain Square near Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro Avenue where the headquarters of Ihru is located. At 9.05 hours he entered the superbo building of eight floors and on the counter they transmitted it, dry and coldly: "There are no vacancies, come back at 14.00 hours!". The citizen looked at the small waiting room and were sitting around twenty people. Eight floors to serve 20 people each morning? Ah… there are many other services in IHRU and employees have more to do…
But who created this ungrateful mess were the finances and the revolt fell over IHRU and the institute was not prepared for the reaction of more than 85,000 people… The citizen concerned returned to Moscavide by the same way and at noon left again On the same way to the headquarters of IHRU, hoping that his problem of removing his income subsidy would be resolved, as his income from last year to this year had not increased a Euro. Dealde. At 14.00 hours there were no passwords. Poor man who returned to Moscavide and gave up risking some heart attack after so much effort.
Is this to rule for people? Is this the public function and service? Is this what the people deserve? Is this the finance service that does not waste time penalizing a Portuguese that is late in the payment of any tax? Is this to rule for people? Is this, protecting the most unprotected from the nation? Is this, a way to make people believe in politicians? This is this, which causes the people to manifest themselves in the polls that are fed up with cruel and liars and tend to vote for President of the Republic in a man like Admiral Gouveia and Melo. Ai, Portugal, Portugal…</description><pubDate>2025-02-17 01:17:09</pubDate></item><item><title>The False Ally</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/14/o-falso-aliado/</link><description>It seems that we started to open our eyes, because, believing in the poll that today is news, only 18% of the probed Portuguese think the US is a country of our ally. I think they never went, except in a short period of World War II and, even then, only for circumstantial convenience of both countries.
Who sent here was the Salazar who even the US thought horrors, there, although only legally, various parties. He pleased him, however, to realize that the one who actually dictated the rules in Uncle Sam's land were the owners and users of white supremacy who practiced a brutal exploration of color populations, such as Angolan Baixa do Cassange.
In addition, there was also the post-slave maintenance of apartheid, even in public transport, a very difficult reality to ignore even the mafias and a thousand Christian churches.
It turns out that in Europe from 27 the clairvoyance of probes is still more residual because they cordially accept the concept of the “necessary partner”, such as cleaning the tail with various color paper, as can be concluded from the last poll carried out by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR).
In the countries that participated in this inquiry (Germany, Bulgaria, Denmark, Spain, Estonia, France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, United Kingdom, Romania, Switzerland and Ukraine), the vast majority of respondents think the US is enough with them Statute of “necessary partner”, with which one has to cooperate strategically ”.
It is in France and Germany that there are the most significant portions of the population looking to the US as a rival or an opponent, 19% and 23%, respectively.
The poll, held between November and December, also estimates that Trump's reelection only changed European US perception, showing, for example, the change in Denmark, which in the inquiry of April 2023 had more than 50% Of the respondents to say that the US was allies and just over 30% claiming it was Washington was an essential "partner".
Something then changed in the Shakespearean country of Prince Hamlet, where there are now neo -Nazis in the government, such as Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Finland and others.
The authors of the ESFR inquiry warn that “it will be difficult to find a coherent European way for the future” and divide respondents into four categories regarding their view of the position of 27: the European euro-tetimists who see the European Union ( UE) as a power and believe that their collapse is not eminent with Trump in power; European, who think that I is not a geopolitical power and anticipate their collapse soon; Euro-realals, who do not face me as a power, but do not believe it will collapse; And the Euromortaists, who see me as a power at risk of collapse.
I am not sure which of these categories aquartelate me, because my concern is that, as we go, the liberation of Europe for peace, solidarity and dignity of all its citizens seems increasingly distant.
But there we will arrive, since the history of the world is made of ups and downs, never returning to the beginning of all civilizations, when what would eat more would also live more.

Want the neo-Nazi parties and the varied far-right to make the school the bastion of its ideological and cultural battle against the very varied education system, so-called progressive ideology ”for what we see public school and education at the center of a fierce battle to normalize your ideas.
According to a study by the scientific journal "Analytical Archives of Educational Policies", there is a "common political agenda, although with not always subtle nuances, which shape an international of European far-right education." Even without organic or functional structure, it relates under the common idea that "school is a crucial space through which the mentality of the population can be shaped."
The authors of the study, Enrique Javier Diez-Gutiérrez, and Mauro-Rafael Jarquin-demi, cited by António Rodrigues, in the “public”, that the far right fights the progressism instillo in the heads of the populations can reach, and are, and are Many, “traditional values” from a market perspective, that is, dying them with a strange mix of patriotism, neoliberalism, xenophobia and assimilation ”, so those who are not in this wave have been“ leaning against the wall ”, as they cry André Ventura and his proselytes.
The purpose of these modern monsters, very well lepped, is, according to the study's authors, "questioning and discrediting" the public school model, "undermining" the relationship between parents and school, "fostering fear" in teachers until They themselves censor themselves. They want an apolitical and neutral school, at the same time trying to eliminate the reality of a school that educates citizens based on “plural democratic values”, values ​​that favor “social equality”. Give priority to individual decision against public ethics and the common good. ”
It should be added that, knowing all this and professing a democratic-viscerally democratic ideology in the class struggle-I would never be able to “touch the wall” neither the Ventura nor his former luggage luggage.</description><pubDate>2025-02-14 00:46:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao in the year of the serpent and mass tourism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/macau-no-ano-da-serpente-e-o-turismo-de-massas-2/</link><description>(Continuation of the February 6 edition)
The area from Senate Largo to Rua de S. Domingos, Rua da Palha, Travessa do Bispo and Travessa da Sé should be thoroughly planned in tourist and gastronomic terms and the stores should be located there for Chinese cuisine, Macaense, Portuguese and International and the remaining spaces are explored by stores of tourist interest and recommended by Macao tourism services. Only in this way Macau will honor the distinction of being considered a creative city in the area of ​​gastronomy by UNESCO and will produce in part the longed for economic diversification. Other types of urban planning to tourist activity and gastronomic scripts should also be created in other areas of Macau, Taipa and Coloane.
Mass tourism alters the social landscape of any destination. In Macao, the influx of millions of tourists every year has transformed local customs and traditions. The local population, which is significantly smaller than the annual number of tourists, sees their cultural practices and lifestyle overshadowed by the growing marketing of the region. The balance between the preservation of cultural identity and the satisfaction of mass tourism is complex. Macao's previous head of the Macao Executive, Ho Iat Seng, advocated initiatives that promote cultural tourism, with the aim of showing the rich heritage of Macao from its modern attractions. These efforts include heritage conservation projects and local handicraft promotion, allowing residents to interact with tourists in an authentic and respectful way.
On the other hand, local feeling can be a challenge, as some residents express frustration with the overwhelming presence of tourists. The growing population of tourists creates agglomeration in public spaces and facilities, leading to the dissatisfaction of the local inhabitants. The resolution of these tensions is essential to maintain a harmonious coexistence between residents and visitors. The environmental impact of mass tourism is another critical aspect that deserves to be discussed. Macau's rapid urbanization led to remarkable ecological changes. The construction of resorts and casinos resulted in the loss of habitats and increased pollution. The increase in the number of daily tourists contributes to waste production (where rats are proliferating and also invading stores in the historic center including those serving food) and the use of local resources, which arouses concerns of sustainability.
Recent efforts started by the Macao government focus on the attenuation of these negative effects through environmental regulations and ecological initiatives. In order to promote sustainable tourism practices, proposals include the incentive to use public transport (insufficient and where users are fitted by dealership employees in Ferreira do Amaral Square and drivers as if it was shouting and where those Large bags of tourists take the place of users and hurt them sometimes without anyone prohibiting such practice) and the promotion of ecological construction initiatives for new enterprises. These policies reflect a growing awareness of the need to preserve the Macao environment of its economic ambitions.
Several influential personalities shaped Macau's tourist landscape. Among them is the late Dr. Stanley Ho, one of the most prominent figures of the casino industry and one of the main architects of Macau transformation into a global game center.
His vision and investments had a lasting impact on the region, leading to the construction of several milestones that are now synonymous with Macao Tourism. In addition, public and private sectors leaders are crucial in promoting responsible tourism practices that residents require. Hospitality and tourism management professionals should defend sustainable strategies to balance economic growth and environmental conservation. Their efforts should contribute to the ongoing discussions on the maintenance of a viable tourism model in the face of changes in market dynamics.
The prospects for mass tourism in Macau vary widely among stakeholders. Government officials often emphasize economic benefits, seeing tourism as a vital engine for growth. They promote policies that attract investments and tour operators, arguing that these measures create job opportunities and improve infrastructure. On the other hand, local residents may have a more critical perception of tourism.
They emphasize the negative effects on their quality of life, including cultural dilution and increased cost of living. Its voices illustrate the need for a more inclusive approach to tourism development that gives priority to community participation and feedback. From a business point of view, tourism sector operators are caught between tourists and local community's needs. Although they strive to attract visitors, they also have to consider the long -term sustainability of their operations. If local feeling continues to sour, it may end up endangering your business.
Looking to the future, Macau faces various developmental challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic had a dramatic impact on global tourism, including in Macao, where the number of visitors has fallen significantly since the early 2020. Recovery strategies should now align with sustainable development goals. The government is exploring diversification beyond play and mass tourism, promoting cultural tourism, sports events and family attractions as alternative pathways. With the resumption of trips, Macao has the opportunity to reconcellize his tourism model. The adoption of ecotourism and cultural initiatives can help attract more visitors. Innovative marketing strategies that enhance unique cultural heritage and the natural beauty of Macau can increase its attraction and at the same time mitigate the negative aspects of mass tourism.
The sectoral collaboration between government bodies, local communities and the private sector will be crucial to shaping a future tourist landscape that benefits all stakeholders.
The involvement of local populations in tourism planning and decision making can create a sense of shared property, ultimately leading to a sustainable and inclusive tourist framework. The relationship between Macao's cultural evolution and the mass tourism phenomenon reveals a multifaceted and complex dynamic.
The year of the serpent serves as a reflection of growth and transformation in this context. Although mass tourism has generated significant economic benefits, it also has challenges related to social, environmental and cultural consequences. To ensure a balanced approach, stakeholders must work in collaboration to navigate the intricacies of tourism development, ensuring that Macau maintains their unique identity, while benefiting economically.
As the tourist landscape evolves, the adoption of sustainable practices and the promotion of community involvement will be fundamental to preserving Macau's essence for future generations.</description><pubDate>2025-02-13 01:41:00</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC | Alex Chao Pictures About Macau exposed from today</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/frc-imagens-de-alex-chao-sobre-macau-expostas-a-partir-de-hoje/</link><description>Today is inaugurated in the Rui Cunha Foundation gallery the photography exhibition “Macau in My Heart”, an ode to the territory from which Alex Chao Io Chong, the author of the images, is natural. Until March 1, 30 images on various places that show the unique side of the territory can be seen free of charge
 
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) inaugurates today, from 6.30 pm, the photograph exhibition “Macau in My Heart”, by Alex Chao Io Chong, a well -known local artist and a professional photographer for over 30 years, which brings together this collection of 30 Photographs of the city, exploring different topics, styles and approach techniques. The curatorship is in charge of David Sit, art critic, painter and university professor.
Quoted by a FRC press release, Alex Chao described that he began “a photographic trip of decades as a teenager,” resorted to the lens and camera “as a poet uses a pen, to turn such deep emotions into a visual language, Capturing distinct moments such as the transformation of this city, from a fishing village in a prosperous international city, and recording poetic images by intertwining history and modernity. ”
The images captured illustrate the architecture of the old and recent city, the urban movement, the sparkles and the colors, the rhythm of the population. “Here, the Portuguese historical architecture and the modern high buildings are complemented, while traditions and innovation go hand in hand,” said the photographer and artist.
“Rapid economic development brought prosperity to the city and also made Macao a tourist attraction and a worldwide famous entertainment center. Throughout this process, I witnessed many important moments: the opening of international casinos, the construction of new milestones and the annual fireworks ”, records that are part of some examples in the exhibition.
Connection to the arts
Alex Chao graduated from the Polytechnic University of Macao, with specialization in Visual Arts (Artistic Education). In the early years, he studied and dedicated himself to professional photography and visual arts education. He was a professional photographer at the former Hotel Mandarin East in Macao, for many years, and also director of the photography studio at the then Polytechnic Institute of Arts of Macao, with decades of research and practice in the development of photography.
Alex Chao also has a vast experience in the areas of visual design, book editing, printing, multimedia and exhibition planning.
He was a member of several exhibitions held at the Creative Macau gallery, for example, both collective and individual. The last one was held last year, titled “Unique Vision-Creativity and Aesthetics of Photography”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:45:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Television | "Hard" season of "White Lotus" explores the country's spirituality</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/17/televisao-temporada-mais-dificil-de-white-lotus-explora-espiritualidade-do-pais/</link><description>The third season of the “White Lotus” series, available on the HBO streaming platform, explores religion and spirituality in Thailand and was the “hardest of all,” said creator Mike White. "It was harder because it is longer, there are more characters, and Thailand is a beautiful place to film, but it had many challenges," the creator said at a Los Angeles release conference.
The new season has eight episodes, one more than the previous and two more than the original. It brings back two characters that the audience met in the first and second seasons: Masseur Belinda (played by Natasha Rothwell) and the widower of Tanya Mcquoid, Greg Hunt (played by Jon Gries).
“We were sad because the character of Jennifer Coolidge [Tanya] died in the last episode and we wanted to bring her back, in a way, with Belinda,” explained Mike White. Belinda was the masseuse that Tanya said she was going to help in the first season and then did not.
Explore Buddhism
White, interested in Buddhism for several years, wanted to turn to an exploitation of religion, God and spirituality this season. "Thailand seemed the perfect scenario because it is a Buddhist country and there is something in its culture where it seemed interesting to introduce the chaos of Western," he said.
Mike White also wanted to analyze how people seek to reach their ideal self, but they always seem to be supplanted "by a force that pushes them back to the land of monkeys." The omnipresence of monkeys in the resort where the characters are installed reinforces this idea.
Although with a different theme and rhythm from the previous ones, the narrative style of “White Lotus” remains this third season. It starts with a crime, where it is not possible to see who the victim is, and walks back in time to explain how to the tragic outcome.
In this resort of Thailand, the audience is presented to a group of three friends in the forties - Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan), Laurie (Carrie Coon) and Kate (Leslie Bible), whose relationship deteriorates over the episodes.
“Everyone is pretending to pretend,” Carrie Coon described at the Los Angeles conference. "And I believe that we can all identify with this to pretend that we live an extraordinary life, when we actually feel out," he added.
Leslie Bible pointed out that this is a problem exacerbated by social networks like Instagram, which make it difficult to resist comparison and judgment. "The lives of others look much more like a phone than in real life, which when they are really happening," he said.
Another key piece of this season is the dynamics of the Ratcliff family, with mother Victoria (Parker Posey), father Timothy (Jason Isaacs) and children Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), Lochlan (Sam Nivola) and Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook).
It is a rich family of North Carolina that has many more problems than it looks and will eventually face existential challenges throughout the series. All male members of the family have nudity scenes, something Patrick Schwarzenegger said it has become easier to do for the extreme confidence in Mike White.
"Making scenes of nudity is different when it comes to a screenwriter or director we do not know, who we do not trust or who have never seen work," said the actor, son of Arnold Schwarzenegger. “Mike loves to push the borders and continue to enthusiastic, but also give suspense to the audience,” Patrick continued. "I had no hesitation," he said.
There are also the couple Rick (Walton Goggins) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood), whose difference in ages and vision of the world and relationships will shock the paradisiacal scenario of Thailand. "White Lotus" will debut an episode a week on Mondays for two months at the Max Portugal service.</description><pubDate>2025-02-17 17:26:57</pubDate></item><item><title>BAFTA | Movie “Conclave” collects four awards</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/17/bafta-filme-conclave-arrecada-quatro-premios/</link><description>Edward Berger's “Conclave” was considered yesterday the best film by the British Academy, which awarded him four BAFTA 2025 awards, at a ceremony that became Adrien Brody as best actor and Mikey Madison as best actress.

According to the TSI ruling released yesterday, the Base Judicial Court (TJB) sentenced the man, “for the practice, in material authorship and in the intentional form and attempted, for two crimes of qualified damage to a penalty of nine months in prison for each one ”, and, by legal height, the sentence was“ a single penalty of one year and three months in prison ”.
However, both man and MP appealed to the sentence, because the MP “understood that he should be convicted of the crime of fire for his conduct”, while the man considered “excessive penalty”, and the court requested the type of crime. for "the crime of damage in tempted form."
The TSI considered granting a partial appeal, condemning the man for "practice, as a material author, of a fire crime in the tried form, in the penalty of 10 months in prison." In relation to “the facts at the main door of the MP building, and a penalty of four months in prison for the crime of qualified damage” already verified in the first instance. Thus, the sentence of one year in prison decreed by the TSI appears in legal cumulus.
Of discord
The crimes occurred in January last year, when the man set fire to the premises of the MP and the Judiciary Police (PJ) for not agreeing with a decision that led him to lose more than 800,000 dollars from Hong Kong.
The TSI describes that the man wanted to "take revenge and vent his anger", having bought "a bottle of kerosene and prepared the instruments necessary for the plan." First, he went to the PJ building, "dumped half of the kerosene under a police car parked at the main door and placing newspapers under this car with the aim of damaging it."
The fire was extinguished almost immediately, but the man then headed to the MP building and repeated the act, settling "fire to a towel with a lighter, throwing it to the roll gate", having abandoned the place. The fire was also extinguished quickly. Later, the resident was arrested by PJ agents near the siege gates.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:56:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Flu | 64 -year -old man linked to fan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/gripe-homem-com-64-anos-ligado-a-ventilador/</link><description>A 64 -year -old man is hospitalized in serious condition and linked to a fan, after being infected with the A flu virus.

Chan Ka Leong asks the government to launch a new major consumption award as soon as possible
 
From here until March and April a lot of water will still pass under the bridge. The popular saying goes summarizes the message of the president of the General Union Directorate of Macao residents, Chan Ka Leong, who thinks that until the presentation of economy support measures, contained in the SAM Executive Executive's Lines of Governing Action (LAG) lines (LAG) lines (LAG) Hou fai. Chan Ka Leong, who is also a member of the Executive Board, understands that short-term measures are urgent to stimulate economic development, support and revitalize small and medium enterprises before the presentation.
As such, the leader recommends to the government to urgently launch a new round of the discount coupons program, a major consumption award. In addition, the close connection between community groups, entrepreneurs and traders should also be promoted to organize events that attract people to community neighborhoods outside the tourist circuits. In statements quoted by the Chinese channel of Macau radio, Chan Ka Leong indicated that government intervention in both directions, economic stimuli and attractive events, can alleviate shortly the difficulties felt by citizens and small and medium enterprises. In addition, the leader thinks it is worth studying the possibility of launching another consumer card.
Divine message
Chan Ka Leong also indicated that the pecuniary reimbursement program, or pecuniary checks, should be optimized with regard to its beneficiaries. However, you think you will first have to gather social consensus, not expecting changes in the next lag.
The leader made the recommendations to the executive during a dragon and Leão dance ceremony, held on Sunday afternoon at the IAO Hon garden.
At the same time, the deputy and member of the direction of residents Leong Hong Sai pointed out as a solution to the economic problems of Macao the national support. The legislator recalled that this is the "first year of implementing the spirit of the important speeches given by President XI Jinping during the visit to Macao."
In addition, Macao will benefit from the continuous introduction of policies launched by the interior authorities of China, who will help with the economic diversification of the MSAR.
During the celebration festivities of the Lunar New Year, in the IAO Hon Garden were assembled stalls with games and cultural performances.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:40:22</pubDate></item><item><title>MICE | More events but less visitors</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/mice-mais-eventos-mas-menos-visitantes/</link><description>Statistical data on the sector of exhibitions and conventions (MICE, in the English acronym) reveal that between 2023 and 2024 there were 364 more events, which represents an increase of 31.4 percent in annual terms.

The deputy recalled that the demand for this type of housing has decreased
 
With the legislation that is currently in force, an individual candidate can only compete for a T1 fraction in competitions for economic housing. Also, after the house delivery, if the person contracts marriage, I had a child and his household increases, he cannot move to a more plated fraction.
From the perspective of deputies Nick Lei and Lo Choi In, the government has to amend the law that regulates economic housing and add flexibility to candidates and public housing policies.
Speaking to the citizen newspaper, Nick Lei stressed that the population has long wanted to change the law, relieving the normative rigidity that affects the demand for this type of public housing, but that the government has not corresponded to the will of residents.
The deputy linked to the community of Fujian also advocates the introduction of permanent candidacies in economic housing, ie the delivery of applications at any time and the entry to a waiting list, similar to what happens with social housing.
Supply and demand
Deputy Lo Choi In also defends the flexibility of candidacies for economic housing, but points out that in recent years the demand for this type of housing has decreased significantly. In fact, in the last contest, opened in September 2023, the number of valid applications (5,076) was lower than the available fractions (5,415). In total, 6,562 applications were delivered.
From the optics of Lo Choi In, to make economic housing more attractive it is necessary to increase the proportions of T2 apartments, lower the price of houses (which are too close to the private market) and allow buyers to resell fractions in the market. Currently, if a resident wants to sell an economic housing apartment can only alienate it to the housing institute for a value corresponding to that of the initial purchase.
Also in statements to the Citizen Journal, the deputy also showed concern about the increased rally credit related to mortgage loans for housing. Lo Choi in appealed to government's attention to a problem that he considers at risk the stability of the financial market of Macau.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:35:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us around the house, pies us his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on violations in Ukraine in this “special operation”), an act that he forced us to watch, and then we tell him: High There we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You haven't said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - Madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails about sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is managed to seek a reason for Things abroad to us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicidou -If and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ that had not entered the story. »
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when you announced the Nobel Prize in this year's literature, I couldn't help but remember this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, compared to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large newspaper Daily National Wrote wrote Five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize of Literature was awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete unknown. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners - I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example - but that only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone is He knows and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from him.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I also preferred that in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have been awarded. Les années ”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club Narrative Prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho Award Coast.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification as to their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but to be highlighted simply that we "we do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funeral trips for countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - which starts still awaits us, that secret spells we will still have to overcome, what horrors will be erected before our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the midst of Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneousness and frankness were coarcet in relationships in relations Human, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a "essence", therefore declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, "one and absolute". Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as António Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and very noble poet, but one Also victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I malice.

Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people, who always seems the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters At eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Evidently, they are the two 'Bigger Than Life', but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my rank of hatter at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and Treasurer.

The United States "retreated severely" in its position on Taiwan and sent the wrong message to the island's "separatist forces", said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun.
"We urged the US to (…) to stop encouraging and supporting Taiwan's independence and avoid further harming relationships between China and the US and peace and stability in Taiwan's narrow," said Guo, when asked about the Review at a press conference.
The US State Department removed the phrase “we did not support Taiwan's independence” from the informative document last week. The document on US relations with the autonomous island is published on its official portal.
This is not the first time the state department has removed the sentence. In May 2022, the State Department removed the sentence, but once again put it a few weeks later, after a strong protest from China.
It is unclear why the State Department has changed the language again and if it signals some change in the policy of President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House last month. The US does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but are its strongest supporter and largest gun supplier.
China, which states that Taiwan should be under its control, has intensified the military exercises around the island of 23 million in the inhabitants in recent years.

A video released by the CCTV state television channel shows the applauding, before the entry of Xi and other Communist Party leaders of China (CCP), at the beginning of an unusual symposium with private sector executives, including companies such as Tencent, Byd, Huawei and DeepSeek (see main text).
The fall of MA dates back to the end of 2020, when he gave a controversial speech, which attacked Beijing's strategy to minimize risks in the financial system and traditional banks, which, according to him, were managed as "pledge houses."
Days later, the Chinese regulators forced the suspension of Alibaba's Fintech Scholarship entry into the subsidiary, Ant Group, operator of the popular Payment Platform Alipay. The deal, which derailed only 36 hours before the expected date for its realization, should have been the biggest entry into history in history, allowing the company to raise $ 34.5 billion.
Until then, Ma was the richest man in China - is now the eighth with a fortune of $ 27.2 billion, less 44 percent than in 2021. The entrepreneur was not only the great visible face of the development of the sector Private in the Asian country, as it was also considered practically untouchable.
In the shadow
After the Beijing disputes, Ma remained discreet, to the point that the authorities would have forbidden him to leave the country or have been detained.
The change, according to the experts, arrived in early 2023, when Ant Group met one of Beijing's main demands: dissolve MA's vote power, which many analysts interpreted as the end of a regulatory campaign that had resulted in fines Anti-monopoly against Alibaba and other prominent companies such as Tencent or Didi, the "Chinese Uber".
In the words of consulting firm Trivium China: "The campaign started with Jack Ma and ends with Jack Ma".
In March of the same year, the businessman reappeared in China after news that he had moved abroad, and experts anticipated that Beijing hoped his return to encourage government efforts to regain private sector confidence.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:49:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Xi Jinping receives leaders from the private sector</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/economia-xi-jinping-recebe-lideres-do-sector-privado/</link><description>The high level meeting between the central authorities and representatives of the private sector, some linked to new technologies, gives a new sign of trust to the home economy

Xi gave an “important speech” after listening to several business leaders, official news agency Xinhua said. The details of the speech have not yet been published.

The Hong Kong South China Morning Post newspaper has advanced that Jun, founder and executive director of Xiaomi, Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba Group, Wang Chuanfi, President and Executive Director of the BYD electric vehicle manufacturer, and Ren Zhengfei, founder and director Executive of the Huawei Technologies group, are some of the names that circulate as possible participants.
Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and China's chief leading chief, Wang Huning, were also present.
Last year, China advanced with several measures to replace trust with investors as domestic consumption remained weak and the external environment brought new challenges, with the election of Donald Trump in the United States. The meeting is interpreted as a Beijing's turnaround, which in recent years has launched a harsh regulatory campaign against major technology companies.

In December 2020, the regulatory authorities announced the opening of an anti -monopoly investigation into Alibaba and suspended Antoni's entry into the Fintech branch, which would be the largest in history.
This campaign included investigations to companies such as Tencent and Didi, “Uber Chinese” for alleged risks to users' data security. For years, the digital sector has flourished in China, not only thanks to the huge market in the country, but also to a little rigorous regulation - or its application - to which Beijing wanted to end.
XI does not hold this type of meetings frequently. Although lower -level employees regularly met with entrepreneurs, the last time Xi attended a high level meeting was in September 2018. China's private investment fell 0.1 percent, in homologous terms, in 2024.
The rapid evolution of the country's technological progress - represented by the success of the domestic artificial intelligence model Deepseek - provided political decision makers a new way for sustainable economic growth and investors a reason for renewed enthusiasm.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:47:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Technology | XI receives leaders from the Chinese giants</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/17/tecnologia-xi-recebe-lideres-dos-gigantes-chineses/</link><description>Chinese President Xi Jinping will today receive leaders of the country's technology giants, in a demonstration of support for the sector, according to sources mentioned Friday by the Hong Kong Kong South China Morning Post.
According to the newspaper, between 20 and 30 founders or executive directors of starting companies and established companies, such as Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba and Xiaomi, will participate in the unusual “high level meeting”.
The meeting takes place weeks before the Chinese legislature holds its annual meeting, in which the government traces the economic script for next year, and in the midst of intensifying the trade war with the United States after the return to Donald Trump's power.
The newspaper said the legislature seeks to send a positive signal to the private sector to revive the country's economy.
The meeting can also be interpreted as a Beijing turnaround, which in recent years has launched a harsh regulatory campaign against major technology companies. For years, the digital sector has flourished in China, not only thanks to the huge market in the country, but also to a little rigorous regulation - or its application - to which Beijing wanted to end.
However, advances such as the Deepkseek artificial intelligence and intelligence, which will also be present at the meeting, were an important technological blow to Beijing, in the face of Trump's trade war. Alibaba has also recently revealed its own AI model, Qwen, which will partner with Apple to allow iPhones to offer Apple Intelligence service in China, according to the Hong Kong newspaper.
Also present at the event will be representatives of Huawei, and the so -called “six little dragons” of the Chinese “technological mastery”, which include, in addition to DeepSek, the manufacturers of UNITEE and Deep Robotics robots, the Game Science studio, the creator of 'Software' of 3D Manycore interiors and Brainco interior design, which develops products designed to train the brain.</description><pubDate>2025-02-17 01:22:36</pubDate></item><item><title>New Delhi | Stamped kills at least 18 people</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/17/nova-deli-debandada-mata-pelo-menos-18-pessoas/</link><description>At least 18 people died in a stampede at a railway station in the capital of India, Nova Deli, the news agency Press Trust of India said yesterday.
Nova Deli's interim chief minister, Atishi, said many of the victims traveled to Prayagraj in northern India, where the Kumbh Mela festival is taking place, which originates annually the largest Hindu pilgrimage in the world.
The stampede took place on Saturday night, while thousands of people were gathered at Nova Deli's railway station waiting to catch a train. The incident occurred after some passengers slipped and fallen over others as they descended from a passage that connects trains platforms, the authorities said.
Sheela Devi, who was at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narain hospital in Nova Delhi, to collect her daughter -in -law, said an announcement about a train platform changed confusion among passengers, which led to the stampede. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Moda said he was "distressed by the stampede."
“My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a quick recovery. Authorities are assisting all those affected by this stampede, ”Modi said on social network X. Railroad Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said an investigation was ordered to find out what led to the stampede.
Tragedies succeed
The incident happened a day after at least ten people died and another 19 was injured after a vehicle that was heading for Kumbh Mela collided with an bus. Traffic accidents are common in India due to poor road conditions, the precarious conditions of some vehicles and the lack of attention to drivers' traffic rules.
In recent days, Kumbh mela organizers have banned vehicle circulation in the festival area after thousands of people have been trapped in various traffic jams, with an extension of more than 200 kilometers and some drivers reporting that they needed 12 hours to Advance 50 kilometers.
Kumbh Mela has been taking place every 12 years in a different city (between Prayagraj, Ujjain, Nashik and Haridwar) and has a ritual bath that happens at the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers.
The Hindus, which represent almost 80 percent of the country's more than 1.4 billion more than 1.4 billion, believe that a dive in this considered sacred place can purify them from past sins and end the reincarnation process.
The train tickets sold out before Kumbh Mela began, while the cost of plane tickets fired, leading millions of people to opt for the car trip. This year's edition of the festival, which lasts six weeks, was already marked by the death of at least 30 people in a stampede on January 29.</description><pubDate>2025-02-17 01:20:01</pubDate></item><item><title>China and Brazil reaffirm in Munich commitment to peace</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/17/china-e-brasil-reafirmam-em-munique-compromisso-com-a-paz/</link><description>Chinese diplomacy head Wang Yi reiterated in Munich in a meeting with Brazilian special counselor Celso Amorim, the commitment of the two countries to end the war in Ukraine, the Chinese authorities said yesterday.
At a meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the Chinese and Amorim Foreign Minister, a special sent by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, reaffirmed the good health of bilateral relations.
In a statement, the China Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated that both highlighted the work of the “Friends of Peace” platform, created by the two countries within the UN to explore alternative peaceful solutions for war in Ukraine, and pledged to play a role. constructive in obtaining a political solution.
China and Brazil have pressured developing countries to support a six -point peace plan, which presented in 2024, which describes the Russian invasion of Ukraine as “a crisis”, asks “the end of climbing or provocation by either party ”and appeals to an international peace conference through a“ fair debate ”.
The initiative was received with skepticism by many Western countries and Ukraine itself, mainly due to the ambiguity demonstrated by Beijing since the beginning of the conflict and its tacit support to Moscow.
Arm -arm
Wang stressed that China is willing to work with Brazil to continue cooperation, "practice true multilateralism, defend the fundamental role of the United Nations and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of global southern countries."
Amorim told the Chinese diplomat that Brazil is open to continuing to work with the Asian giant to "defend international justice."
Wang and Amorim also agreed to deepen cooperation in Latin America and the BRICS Community of Emerging Economies, whose rotating presidency was assumed by Brazil this year. The Brics of Brics Cimeira, formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, will take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6 and 07.
In addition to the founding countries, in recent years, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Iran, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia have joined the bloc as members of full right, and Bolivia, Cuba, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan and Nigeria have recently joined as associated states.
According to official data, China is the largest commercial partner in Brazil since 2008. The Chinese market was the destination of 30 percent of Brazilian exports in 2023, the year that totaled $ 104 billion, consisting mostly by food products and raw materials.
China maintains investments in Brazil of about $ 40 billion, especially in the energy sector.</description><pubDate>2025-02-17 01:11:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Cook Islands discuss cooperation with Beijing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/14/ilhas-cook-discutem-cooperacao-com-pequim/</link><description>The COOK Prime Minister said yesterday that he spoke to Chinese institutions about Marine Science and Economic Cooperation, during a trip to China, where he should sign a partnership that raised concerns in New Zealand.
During the trip to China, which began on Monday and ends today, Mark Brown is expected to sign a partnership agreement with Beijing, whose details are not known.
New Zealand, the country with which Cook Islands have a security partnership, has been concerned about this visit. Brown said in a statement that he hopes to "be able to share more information in the coming days" as the main agreements are finalized.
The trip raised concerns about the New Zealand government about the alleged lack of transparency in the planned agreement between the Cook and China Islands, at a time when Beijing seeks to increase the influence on the South Pacific.
The Cook Islands have their own government, but their foreign and defense policy is under the control of New Zealand, which is forced to help them in emergency situations. On the other hand, the approximately 17,000 cook islands inhabitants have New Zealand citizenship and can live, work and access the public services of New Zealand.
For the common good
Brown said that during the visit, he maintained talks with Chinese institutions “about Marine Science, climate resistance and economic cooperation” that “opened the door to new areas of collaboration”, including deep sea exploration and aquaculture.
"I want to assure our people that all conversations are guided by what is best for Cook Islands: to ensure that our partnerships support economic growth, environmental sustainability and national sovereignty," the politician said.
Brown had already secured New Zealand that the deal would not have an impact on his relationships and that there would be no surprises in the domain of security.
The opposition in the Cook Islands was not satisfied, having presented a censorship motion against Brown on Wednesday because of the tension with New Zealand, local media.
Relations between New Zealand and the Cook Islands, which were a New Zealand colony between 1901 and 1965, are not the best, after Wellington rejected a proposal from his partner to be able to use his own passport and not the issued by the New Zealand authorities, as so far.
The New Zealand government indicated that its own passport would be equivalent to amending the Citizenship Statute of the Cook Islands and that this would imply the amendment of the partnership.</description><pubDate>2025-02-14 00:48:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | Beijing greets phone call between Trump and Putin</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/14/ucrania-pequim-sauda-telefonema-entre-trump-e-putin/</link><description>China said yesterday that the dialogue is the only way out for war in Ukraine and congratulated Wednesday's talks between US President Donald Trump and Russian homologist Vladimir Putin.
"Russia and the United States are influential powers and we congratulate ourselves that they are reinforcing dialogue, which is the only way to get out of the crisis," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun in press conference.
"From the beginning, Chinese President Xi Jinping has defended peace talks," he added. Trump and Putin agreed to start “immediate negotiations” to end the conflict. The spokesman added that China will “continue to strive” for peace and play “a constructive role” in the resolution of the war.
Since the beginning of the Russian invasion, China has adopted an ambiguous position, appealing to respect for the territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine, and respect for the “legitimate security concerns” from all parts, in reference to Russia.
Beijing also condemned unilateral sanctions against Moscow for “not solving problems” and repeatedly appealed to a “political solution” to the conflict, advanced with a peace proposal, which was then rejected by Kiev and the Western Allies.</description><pubDate>2025-02-14 00:40:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Ricardo Clara Couto, author of the documentary about Francisco de Pina | The weight of the guilt that persists</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/ricardo-clara-couto-autor-do-documentario-sobre-francisco-de-pina-o-peso-da-culpa-que-persiste/</link><description>“Francisco de Pina - The Portuguese who wrote the future of Vietname” tells the story of Father Jesuit, born in Guarda in 1586, who made the romanization of the Vietnamese alphabet. The documentary, by Ricardo Clara Couto was funded by RTP2 and aired at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center
How did you come across this character in Portuguese history in the East?
My brother, named Filipe Pires, traveled for Vietnam for a while and when he arrived from the trip he told me that he had to know the incredible history of the Jesuit Francis of Pina who had made the romanization of the Vietnamese alphabet, providing freedom and cultural independence tremendous. I was a little skeptical at first, because I found it strange no one to know this in Portugal, but I started my research on the subject and discovered a university study of a Franco-Vietnamese teacher who teaches in Madeira. I then confirmed that the idea that my brother had brought from Vietname was correct. From there, I tried to discover the origin of this priest, the work he had done, and realize why there was so little knowledge about Francisco de Pina in Portugal.
In addition to being a Jesuit missionary, can you highlight some biographical points that help you understand your legacy?
In the documentary I did not have the time to be able to take a more exhaustive biographical approach. I focused on the part where he arrives at Vietname. We talk about a man with an incredible culture and a desire to acculturate and be acculturated. A man who was a musician and was easier, thus learning the Vietnamese, which is a six -tone language. Deep down, despite being a Jesuit priest, he had the first of course culture and not so much religion. This, for me, is a reason for huge admiration. For him the essential objective of evangelization was secondary, because, for him, if we could not understand the culture of Vietname, we could not teach the Vietnamese people. It was more important to deepen local culture and language, making it possible to be able to explore the most religious part. It was also a man who had a hard time when he arrived at Vietname.
Why?
There were some internal wars before some local gentlemen of the regions who did not agree with the mission of the priests. This is not explored in the documentary, but in fact Francisco de Pina even made some steps [for the Jesuit mission], as the priests were not totally accepted everywhere. He eventually took refuge in a Japanese neighborhood and, from there, built his base.
Francisco de Pina, like what happened to many Jesuits at the time, was training in Macau, at the College of S. Paulo. How was it influenced by this period spent in the territory?
There is not much information about this time. It is known that it was indeed formed in this college, as was the case with many Jesuit priests at the time, but then went to Japan. Only then go to Vietname. So far, there was nothing of great relief in the life of Francisco de Pina, who followed the normal way. Japan was already expelling the Jesuit priests and it is in this context that goes to Vietname. The only most prominent thing about this period is that the 14 ships that left Portugal to arrive in Macau this year remained only three, and the ship where I was Pina Francisco was one of those who survived the storm.
Do you consider that your great legacy was the romanization of Vietnamese? What are the great contributions of this process in linguistic terms?
It is a giant contribution. If we think that even in the romanization of the language, Vietname was very dependent on the Chinese alphabet, and could not have cultural, linguistic and economic independence as well. After the romanization of the alphabet it was possible for Vietname to grow in these domains and have her own identity. The country has grown a lot to this day, because without writing a tongue passes only to the new generations of mouth in mouth, and the legacy of Francisco de Pina also remains today. The Vietnamese people are very grateful to this, and the proof is that two years ago a delegation of the Vietnammemesse Language Foundation Foundation came to Portugal and offered a monument to Guarda City Council (see Caixa) in honor of Francisco de Pina. However, I was surprised by the fact that the Vietnamese, and we talked about full -sided academics, know the story, the figure of Francisco de Pina, existing in the country several references. But in Portugal it is a little known figure.
How do you explain this?
I think this will have to do with the need Portugal has to make its catharsis about this period of history. Portugal was a completely different country from Africa to the East, and completely different from Africa to the Americas. But, however, there is this weight of guilt. Portugal cannot talk about this period of time, despite having a rich history between Africa and the East, but this time is not very approached because the country has not taken over what happened and, therefore, cannot talk about this period. Therefore, so much of the rich history of Portugal is unknown to the Portuguese.
How was the research process for the documentary?
I quickly arrived at the study of Professor Minh Ha Nguyen Lo Cicero of the University of Madeira, and with her we went to the roots of the Vietnamese language. When I discovered it was amazing, because it is part of the Vietnamese alphabet romanization triangle, as it is Franco-Vietnamese. Until recently, the official version that existed was that Alexandre de Rhodes, French Jesuit, had romanized the alphabet, later registering it in the Vatican and saying that it was a work in honor of his master, Francisco de Pina. However, the name of Francisco de Pina disappeared. From here we passed to the nationalist French official narrative that the romanization of the alphabet had been made by French because Vietname was a French colony. Then I also arrived at Professor António Morgado. The remaining contacts were made at Vietname, linguists, university professors and language specialists, especially in writing, who later joined the documentary.
How would you describe the Vietname of the time of Francisco de Pina?
It was very fragmented. They have a very their own culture that existed through a writing with Chinese hieroglyphics, but deals with Vietnamese, which led only 1 to 3 percent of the population to read and write. With the romanization this percentage increased exponentially, and with this the culture developed with the populations, united them more around common writing. I think this has made Vietname more modern and prepared to integrate into the rest of the world by having a more affordable language.
Do you feel it will help unravel this part of the history of Portugal, as well as the history of the Jesuit mission itself?
I hope so. Portugal seems to have a certain fear and shame to talk about this time, and proof of this is that this Vietnamese people came to Guard to offer a monument and practically did not come out of the subject. In addition, the representatives of the Vietname delegation were a little admired for not being received at an official level, except for the mayor of Guarda. I, who was invited by them to be present, felt a little shame of others, because Vietname came to Portugal to offer a monument and this is viewed as a secondary event, which is not. It would be important to make known this priest and this made to the country and the world, because Portugal and Vietnam have a very close and rich cultural history, as with Japan and China. But this is a little known aspect of the Portuguese people and [this documentary] can be a good opportunity for the country to make their catharsis.
Vietnamese artist sculpture resembles Francisco de Pina at Guarda
In November 2023, the Vietnamese Language Foundation offered the city of Guarda the sculpture “Nova Estela” by Vietnamese artist Nguyen Huy Anh. The work can be seen in the Garden of the Eduardo Lourenço Municipal Library. According to news from the agency Ecclesia, the event took place under the celebrations of the 824th anniversary of the attribution of Foral by King D. Sancho I to the city. “This is a posthumous tribute to Father Francisco de Pina, a Guarda-born Jesuit priest in 1586, whose religious path underwent a mission in Vietname, where he lived nine years of intense missionary activity, linguistics and of interculturality, ”said the Diocese of the Guard, in a statement.
According to the same note, the missionary Francisco de Pina was responsible for the introduction of the Latin alphabet and diacritical signs in the transcription of the sounds and tones of the Vietnamese language, which used, in writing, Chinese characters.
The priest embarked for over 400 years at the Nau de Nossa Senhora do Mount of Carmo, having completed the training at the São Paulo College in Macau and received the priestly ordination in Malaca. It was then called to the newly created Mission of the Jesuit Cchinchina, a zone that corresponds to the central part of the current Vietname. “He never came to the city where he was born and now returned in a bronze -carved boat by Vietnamese artists brought by the distant Vietname sea. From now on, Father Francisco de Pina will be in the historical memory of the guard and its inhabitants, materialized in this boat that brought him back to his city, leaving the name of the guard far, also written in Bronze letters ” , concluded the diocese.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 00:46:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Francisco Leandro, author and professor at the University of Macao: “Support from the country reinforces the role of Macao platform”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/16/francisco-leandro-autor-e-professor-na-universidade-de-macau-apoio-do-pais-reforca-o-papel-de-plataforma-de-macau/</link><description>Gang Wen interview with China Daily newspaper
Francisco Leandro, an associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Macao, states that the nation's support has allowed the MSA to serve as the Center for Commerce, Investment and Cultural Interactions between China and Portuguese -speaking communities.
 
 
How do you see Macau's development since your return to the homeland? Among the city's achievements, which ones impressed him most? What about its sector, has there been an important progress in the last 25 years?
The 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the homeland and the creation of the Special Administrative Region of Macao is a significant milestone in the history of the region, reflecting a successful diplomatic process and demonstrating its current political and economic stability. Currently, RAE de Macao enjoys political stability and is deeply integrated into national development plans. The governance of the city under the beginning of “a country, two systems” allowed him to maintain a high degree of autonomy, while aligning himself with national policies. This integration facilitated Macao's economic growth, making it a vital part of the country's broader economic strategy.
Macao's socioeconomic development strategy is consecrated in the policy “a center, a platform, a base”. This picture aims to position MSA as a world center of tourism and leisure, reinforcing its attraction as a global tourist destination. In addition, MSAR acts as a platform for economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, promoting international trade and cultural exchange. Rae de Macao is also becoming a base of exchange and cultural cooperation, promoting cultural interactions and the conservation of heritage. This multifaceted approach supports Macao's integration into national development plans and reinforces its global presence. The unique position of MSA as a bridge between China, in particular the great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay, and Portuguese-speaking countries underline their strategic importance.
The concept of “a platform, three centers” enhances Macao's role in promoting economic and cultural exchange. This platform allowed the city to serve as a platform for trade, investment and cultural interactions, reinforcing the ties between China and the Lusophone world.
Macau's development as a tourism and leisure center, along with the promotion of four main industries - conventions and exhibitions, cultural and creative industries, traditional Chinese medicine and modern financial services - diversified its economy. These initiatives not only boosted economic activity, but also reinforced the global attraction of Macau as a tourist destination.
The central government adopted a series of policies for Macao. Is there any specific measure that has benefited your sector? As?
The interior of China and the Macao Economic Economic Partnership Agreement (Cepa) play a crucial role in the great bay and in the promotion of ties with Portuguese -speaking countries. By promoting commercial and economic cooperation, the strain reinforces the position of MSA as a bridge between China and Lusophone countries. This agreement facilitates access to the market, investment and cultural exchange, promoting Macao as an international business center. In addition, the strain supports the integration of Macau in the Great Bay area, contributing to regional development and economic diversification. This strategic role underlines the importance of Macau in the broader economic and diplomatic initiatives in the country.
The promotion of higher education in RAE de Macao also played a crucial role in its development. In investing in education and research, Macau contributed to the objectives of national development and was positioned as a center of academic excellence. This bet on education has allowed to create a skilled labor, essential to sustain economic growth and innovation. The University of Macao is highly considered in global academic rankings. It was classified in 180th place at the World University Rankings 2025 by Times Higher Education, and 245th at QS World University Rankings 2025. In addition, the University of Macao is ranked 262nd in the best global universities by US News &amp; World Report. These classifications reflect the university's commitment to excellence in teaching and research, particularly in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Engineering and Social Sciences. The university's strong international collaboration and innovative investigation contribute significantly to their estimated global position.
This year is the third anniversary of the creation of the Guangdong-Macau in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin. In your opinion, how should Macau continue to take advantage of the advantages of the zone to develop himself and the education sector?
Hengqin's cooperation zone is one of the main objectives of Macao's modernization efforts. This zone has been fundamental to boosting innovation and economic diversification, providing a space for new industries and promoting a narrower integration with the continent. The area exemplifies Macau's commitment to modernization and its strategic role in regional development.
Macao is a unique mix of Chinese and Portuguese cultures. In your opinion, how can this merger help the nation to reinforce communication with the international community and tell the good stories of China?
Macao is a fascinating mix of cultures, where the East meets the West in a unique and harmonious way. His linguistic landscape is a testimony of his multicultural heritage. The Chinese is the official language and the Portuguese language can be used for official purposes, reflecting the historical ties of Macao with Portugal and its Chinese roots. English is also widely spoken, especially in business and tourism, which makes Macau a truly multilingual society.
The legal system of MSAR is another domain in which this cultural mixture is evident. Based on the Portuguese Civil Law System, it was adapted to the local context under the “one country, two systems” principle. This double legal system allows a unique mix of Chinese and Western legal traditions, ensuring that Macau's legal environment is familiar to its residents and accessible to international companies.
Macao's approach to the extrajudicial resolution of commercial conflicts further enhances its multicultural policy. The city offers various arbitration and mediation services that serve both local and international parts, promoting the efficient and friendly resolution of disputes. Macao's open city policy and multicultural attitude are the key to its success as a global center. The city welcomes people from around the world, promoting a diverse and inclusive community. This opening is reflected in its festivals, its gastronomy and their daily lives, where different cultures coexist and enrich each other. Essentially, the mix of language, legal systems and multicultural attitudes of Macau makes it a unique and dynamic place that establishes bridges between cultures and promotes global bonds.
What achievements would you like to see by Macau in the next 25 years?
In short, Macao's future is brilliant, with greater integration with mainland China, its central role in international trade, diversified economic growth and a strong global presence. These elements will ensure Macao's continuous success and development at the world scene. The 25th anniversary of Macao's return to the Fatherland celebrates not only a successful diplomatic achievement, but also the continuous contributions of the region to national and world development. Macao's strategic initiatives and their integration in national plans underline their importance as a dynamic region and facing the future.</description><pubDate>2024-12-16 02:20:12</pubDate></item><item><title>António Antunes, cartoonist: “Sometimes I consider myself an artist”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/12/antonio-antunes-cartoonista-as-vezes-considero-me-um-artista/</link><description>It's called Antonio Antunes, but signs her cartoons simply as Antonio. For 50 years it has characterized today using drawing and humor, most of them in the Express. In an interview, the cartoonist, who designed the days of the April 25, regrets that today young cartoonists do not have so many opportunities to sing in their career
This 50 -year adventure is already long dedicated to Cartoon. Have you ever thought you were going to do this for so many years?
No. Things were happening, and the result is this. There were not even perspectives to have a plan. Portugal has not been a country that greatly favors this type of activities.
He did training at António Arroio school during the Estado Novo period. What was it like to learn arts at a time when the country [Portugal] was so gray, with limits to creativity?
We mainly learned techniques, work or composition. Now creativity is something else. Not only was she very limited, but it's not something to sell either. There are no courses to take artists, there are courses that give us notions about painting composition or techniques, or colors. But that alone is not enough. Then there needs to be anything beyond what is academic. In the arts there is always anything that escapes even if you learn everything. Creativity is a strange thing because there is no rule.
Is Antonio considered an artist?
(Hesitates) Sometimes I consider.
He has had many controversial cartoons, namely Pope John Paul II with the condom in his nose. What were the cartoons that forced you to make the biggest waist play or deal with more pressures?
Maybe it's my happiness, but my problems are never a priori, but to posteriori. So far I have not been very limited in what I can do in the newspaper [Expresso]. Now, when things go out, sometimes have consequences. In Portugal it was the issue of condom in the Pope, internationally other things. This cartoon continues to move.
What was it like to deal with all this controversy?
This cartoon [Pope John Paul II] was controversial because they wanted to be so. That went very well and did not generate any ranks. Then there was a conservative movement within the church that wanted to make it a controversy, three weeks began to excite that, to make a petition. The man who led the Catholic forces said he expected a million signatures, but fortunately he got only 29,000, and the difference made the mountain not a mouse Parisse. It was even discussed at the Assembly [of the Republic]. It is a controversy a lot of little, even more, 30 years later, when the church itself is changing its point of view on this matter, namely with this Pope [Francis], fortunately. In the face of what led me to do this cartoon, I did it again. The Pope's statements at the time were public, they were not even hidden, inside walls, and spoke to the whole world, so also to me. I felt injured, that it made no sense. I think the Pope's attitude at that moment was criminal at the Pico da Aida and in Africa. It was of huge insensitivity and foolishness.
Is Cartoon a throwing weapon, a form of expression?
Throw of throwing is a hard expression of too much, but the cartoon is, in fact, the way I express myself. There are my colleagues who make articles, but I make drawings.
What other cartoons highlights, for what they brought you?
The first one that sensitized me was the one who made me win the world's largest salon in the world [major prize of the XX Salon International of Cartoon, Montreal, 1983], from this corner that is Portugal. A hall that had over a thousand participants, and gaining it was very good. I was safer, confident, because from then on they could continue to do things. This first cartoon also gave controversy, the “Warsaw Ghetto in Shatila”, in which I use the known photograph of the ghetto, a Jewish kid raised, harassed by Nazi soldiers, and in the cartoon the kid is Palestinian and Israeli soldiers. [The controversy was] with all the voices of the Jews, who are experts in this, making a lot of noise, with a certain tone of victimization, even if they are attacking. A hall director said he tried to change the vote, such is the weight of Jewish lobby, but failed.
This cartoon could be drawn today again.
I already published it again. Unfortunately it is not out of date.
But do you feel that much of what you designed about today is repeated, in a sign that the story is cyclical?
There is a resistance to change. One of the merits of the cartoonist is to be able to see ahead of time, or over time if you want. I have the invasion of Crimea made in 2014, and I assume that vision. It was above, and others did it later. There are other examples.
It begins to do cartoon after April 25, 1974, there a little there in the aftermath of the revolution. Do you feel that, in a way, has inaugurated the discipline of the Political Cartoon in Portugal?
Perhaps. But I'm not very clear about it, because before me there was a great designer, João Abel Manta, a fantastic chart, which had a huge difference from us, because we were kids and he already had a culture that allowed him that. But there is a less good side, because he did political propaganda. He was a man of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), and made this advertisement to where the revolution allowed it. Then when things stabilized, he went out and went to do other things. This does not remove the quality, but it is not my notion of Cartoon. I respond to the various stimuli of events otherwise. Cartoon allows me to express opinions, but be able to do so in different meanings of life, perspectives, without being a prisoner, as he became a prisoner of the PCP, was something that helped me a lot.
Did you ever feel any pressure from the newspapers where you collaborated?
(Hesitates). Some things, but they are not important. One thing I got, without much effort, was to make people think I have a bad shape, and it was better not to get me. It helped because they thought twice before talking to me. Once in Expresso, a type of sport commissioned me a cover, and began to give tips on how I should make the design. Until I asked you if I ever told you how to write news. This must have been in memory for many years, and must have reverberated this conversation in other people. I did not go to the Express, I was always in my corner and did not wear out with everyday life, with friendships and enmities.
Do you usually draw here, in the studio?
Here. But this [the image of bad shape] really helped me. And there is also the story of me having another profession. I often say that I really had two professions, because I was a cartoonist and graphic designer, and then I had my clients who were also of the Express, namely the Tabaqueira. He was a friend of the commercial director, a comfortable type, who was staring to negotiate contracts with the newspaper in the name of A Tabaqueira. Therefore, I conveyed an effective image of power that actually did not have. If you add a type that has bad shape to a type that apparently has power, it is a boring (laughs).
When I ask you about the pressures, I think in the period right after April 25, 1974-1975, where everything was politicized. Were there bigger?
I managed to deal with it. During this period of the Prec (ongoing revolutionary process) he even had a cartoon over the need that lasted two years. It was a kind of escape forward. There was a great confusion, and I think it was interested in my newspaper [express], although that was never said. It gave an idea of ​​freshness of the newspaper about a complex period, but they never told me that. I have the idea of ​​this use of Cartoon, it was the way of consolidating the newspaper's independence regarding events, even when sometimes there was no such independence.
Are we today in a politically correct era, where everything seems to offend?
I don't feel, because I don't want to feel. I came to a phase of my life where if they didn't want to put up with me, they don't work. It's easy. Everything that was a struggle to impose a name and a point of view, a career, has already been made. It can be improved and consolidated, but if not, it is not. If I become very inconvenient for the newspaper where I work, and I want to believe this does not happen…
But in general terms, to the news, comments on social networks, do you feel that there is the politically correct?
Of course there is. My situation is of exception. The younger ones in the world of Cartoon have no opportunities at all. They have less than when I started. For various chances of life I have a position that has solidified, but this is not exemplary to what goes on. The new cartonists are full of trouble, there is no room for them, there is no means of payment. They are pushed to get out of the newspapers, not to enter.
Doesn't Cartoon have no place on social networks?
(Hesitates) It may appear, but it doesn't seem to me… Journalism is said to die and we cartoonists are going first. I think this is the trend. Journalism has been losing power in the face of social networks, with an anonymous opinion, which cannot be scrutinized, is very bad and mediocre. And that will grow.
What about Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Can replace the cartoonist.
This one I don't even speak because I do not know the limits, but I am intended to be terrible. It can indeed replace the cartoonist, but there is a subverting creativity.
Is there any public figure who particularly likes to portray in Cartoon?
The other day he said that, in relation to Trump, he had two antagonistic feelings: as a citizen, I find man detestable; But as a cartoonist is my raw material. Putin is also good. All men with many narratives and much power are likely to give good things from the point of view of analyzing a cartoonist. They are politicians with a very clear speech about what they want and what they want, and this can be good for Cartoon.
How do you feel to go to Macau again?
The exhibition [at the Military Club] will be different from the others, with 160 works. It's still a lot. It is a trip for these years, for Portuguese and international politics as well. I'm full of curiosity, promoting the show, seeing what they ask me, but this is part of the game.
The press of Macao does not have a great presence of Cartoon, except for Rodrigo [Rodrigo de Matos].
I know him, I get along with him. But I must say that the phenomenon is similar to Portugal. What do we have here? I, in the Express; Cristina Sampaio in the public; André Carrilho left the Diário de Notícias; António Maia in Correio da Manhã and little more. This is a general trend. Sometimes, and I think this happened to me, there are times when a cartoonist can represent a more value for the newspaper, but it's just a few moments when it can happen. In my most complicated period in Expresso, in the late 1970s, a reference newspaper that was in a country in convulsion, with some “irresponsibility” I could go ahead, and I have the perception that I helped the newspaper to detangle of these limitations. But this happens in very specific periods. In this phase [after April 25], I even made drawings at night that were already out of date.
Do you really have a bad shape or is it just to disguise?
I am shy, but I've been treating myself. (laughs) It was never something that had blocked me, I speak well in public. I'm a type I don't like to take stupid risks. I have been in this building for several years and I know only the gate because it has to be, and I do not want to have the risk of having an antipatic person to whom I confident. I do this with the greatest naturalness.
Military Club Exhibition
After the lecture at the Rui Cunha Foundation, this Wednesday, António will be today at the University of São José to talk to students at the “Cartoon Drawing: Ideas” workshop. This Friday follows the inauguration of the exhibition at the Military Club, which will be evident until January 2.</description><pubDate>2024-12-12 00:58:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Ben Lee, a game analyst, about the new concessions: “We need something grand”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/03/ben-lee-analista-de-jogo-sobre-as-novas-concessoes-precisamos-de-algo-grandioso/</link><description>The game analyst and consultant Ben Lee believes that it is necessary to do much more to diversify the economy of Macau beyond the game, especially given the type of events organized under the new concessions. The analyst thinks that Macau could look at two resorts in Vietnam as examples to follow international tourists
 
What balance do you do the two years of new game concessions?
There is still a lot of work to do. From what we could see so far, dealers have focused on lighter projects, such as local art galleries, cultural events, concerts and small rehabilitation of cultural neighborhoods. Large projects, such as the high -tech amusement park, the conservatory or new hotels have not yet been seen. Since two of the ten years have passed [concession], and given that the construction of some of these projects should take several years, it seems that it will be necessary to add them. The non-game segment revenues, in a percentage of gross revenue obtained by the dealers, seem to be higher than 2019, but have diminished in the last two years. It is possible to return to the next two years to be between the 10.5 and 11 percent verified in 2019.
Recently, Ho Iat Seng thanked the concessionaires for compliance with contracts and collaboration in the development of the non-game segment, reiterating that they were able to make some profits during the pandemic. Do you think it was fair in your words?
Casinos are making efforts to develop the non-game segment, but once again most of these efforts are focused on lower, lower-level events. We don't see great ideas like the $ 2.3 billion investment sphere we see in Las Vegas, for example. If that happened, it would easily fit the $ 15 billion commitments promised by the concessionaires [when signing the new contracts]. We could also talk about the idea of ​​making a Formula 1 competition on the street, as seen in Singapore and recently in Las Vegas.
How do you analyze the recovery of operators in terms of game revenue in recent months?
The recovery of the game in Macao has been extremely good, and the sector is expected to recover to about 78 or 79 percent of the levels recorded in 2019.
The Macao Games Society (SJM), for example, was one of the game operators with the greatest difficulty in terms of cash flow during the pandemic. Do you consider that your recovery, compared to the other five, was positive?
The SJM had difficulties at first, but it seems to be finally making some progress. But there will still be some challenges to reposition your hardware [facilities and other enterprises] in the future.
What can we expect from the new government of Sam Hou Fai for the game area?
The chief executive elected seems to be trying to ensure that operators honor their commitments. Your two terms will probably cover the next eight years of the new concessions. I think that, ultimately, everything will be known to know if he can motivate the various government appliances to perform his vision and mission.
In the context of new contracts, how do you see the global evolution of the game sector?
In 2019, the percentage of non-game segment revenues compared to the game's recipes reached 10.5 percent. This percentage rose to 22 percent during COVID-19, and has since gradually fallen to 13.5 percent, according to the third quarter of this year. This percentage will continue to decrease as game recipes continue to grow. In recent times we have seen residents of Macau and Hong Kong go to the north [China] to save money. The question that arises is why the inhabitants of the continent would go down and do the reverse? The solution, as provided by the authorities, is that Macau needs to diversify the market [of tourists and players] that comes from the continent. This makes perfect sense in terms of logic, but the reality is that our efforts seem to be regressing. Visitors from outside the Greater China represented 7.8 percent of the total visitors from Macao, but decreased to 6.5 percent by the end of September this year. This refers to the lightweight events that have been organized that, by far and largely, are really oriented to the Chinese who, after all, constitute most of our source of recipes.
How can you get around this scenario?
Returning to the beginning, I think we really need something large, iconic, similar to the sphere in Las Vegas or even something like the “Golden Bridge” project in Da Nang, worthy of appearing on Instagram, or “Bridge From the kiss ”, in Phu Quoc, both in Vietname. The fact that these projects were built by a local group linked to the hotel sector, without any connection to profits from the game, demonstrates long -term creativity and perspective in terms of planning.
Class struggle
Ben Lee Alert to the danger of the mass market "fleeing" from Macau
The conversation with Ben Lee comes in the context of a lecture that recently starred in the two years of new game concessions. Promoted by the France-Macau Chamber of Commerce, the session was named “Macau New Gaming Landscape: Two Years Into Concessions, What Now?”, Having Igamix Management &amp; Consulting, according to Asian Gaming Brief, according to the portal Gaming Brief (AgBrief), that the VIP game did not end completely, thus being the target of a new classification.
According to Agbrief, quoting words by Ben Lee, "the mass game incorporated the same [players] level that was so openly criticized by the government," but that operators "are changing their focus to accommodating it."
The analyst highlighted the "recent focus on the transformation of older and older hotel rooms into luxury options, with all operators understanding the need to get quality rather than quantity."
However, he argued that “the focus on the luxury segment continues to create an impasse” because “Macau has long focused on increasing the number of visitors to increase revenues”, but the business model “goes against the need to increase expenses per person ”.
Ben Lee also warned that many tourists could, in fact, start choosing other more affordable destinations. The analyst argued that mass players "cannot be ignored" as they remain "the main engine" of the sector. "Exorbitant prices from hotel rooms can be a" dam "for the increase of visitors," as, as suggested, "gamblers can go to other vacation places, such as Thailand, if the price is not good." This Asian country “is growing and is expected to exceed Singapore in terms of gross revenues” at a time when Thai work in the new legislation on the game.
“They hope to pass your game law in May next year. Starting from the principle this happens three to five years to build an integrated resort or enterprise. They may be working considerably before the opening of Japan, ”said Ben Lee.
Still in relation to the game market in Asia, the analyst pointed out that Asian gamblers will focus on the future game markets of Thailand and Japan "while enjoying the current offers in Macau, Singapore and Philippines," wrote Agbrief.</description><pubDate>2024-12-03 00:08:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion expropriated from any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the other, the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, because they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies inquired live below the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death , systematically carried out to this day (still in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the county).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a pandemic context in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GT Cup | Great Bay Race gains impulse from the interior</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/taca-gt-corrida-da-grande-baia-ganha-impulso-do-interior/</link><description>The GT Cup-Great Bay Race will be part of this year, the newly created Sro GT Cup, the latest GT competition launched in the interior of China, inspired by the GT4 class vehicles of the Macau Grand Prix
 
On the eve of last Christmas, Sro Motorsport Group, the entity responsible for organizing numerous races and championships, including the GT World Challenge Asia and, as the official partner of the FIA, the co-coordination of the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau , announced the creation of a competition for GT4 vehicles, consisting of four events in China. At the time of the announcement, only the inaugural event in Shanghai and the end in Beijing had been confirmed as part of the calendar.
Almost 30 cars, representing an impressive total of ten car builders, participated in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race of 2024, a race that has become an important milestone over the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix in recent years. Indeed, no other GT4 event in Asia brings together such quantity and diversity of cars. The Balance of Performance (BOP), responsible for balancing the performance of the various participating cars, was, at the time, managed by SRO.
In a statement, Benjamin Frannasovici, managing director of Sro Motorsports Asia, said:
“We are enchanted, proud and privileged for adding the GT Cup - Great Bay Race to the inaugural calendar of Sro GT Cup, which begins and ends with the two largest motorized sports events in China. We already have a strong working relationship with the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, which has become the most significant race for GT4 cars in Asia. Its inclusion in the 2025 calendar of the SRO underlines the size of our ambition for this new national series. ”
High interest
The SRO GT Cup debut season starts in March at China's Formula 1 Grand Prix in Shanghai, before moving to the Zhuhai International Circuit - a place previously visited by SRO in BPR times and the FIA ​​GT Championship - where two 30 minutes races are planned. This is followed by the new Citadine Circuit of Beijing, which will host the GT World Challenge Asia on the same weekend, before the big end of the Sro GT Cup season, scheduled for a month later at the Guide Circuit in Macao.
The enthusiasm surrounding this competition is evident. As Benjamin Franassovici said, “This is reflected in the number of consultations and registration for the full season we have received since the release of the championship, just before Christmas. The demand has exceeded our expectations. ”
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the season end event on the streets of Macau, with places to be assigned based on the classification after the second round of the championship, which is scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit. All pilots with “bronze” or “silver” classifications attributed by the FIA ​​are eligible to compete in this competition, as long as they use approved cars from the GT4 class.
To attract brands, the results of SRO GT Cup races will tell the SRO GT4 builders ranking, a title attributed to the brand with better performance in the GT4 category at the end of each season. SRO GT CUP joins its Asian equivalent, Japan Cup, in a list that also includes continental and national competitions in Europe, America and Australia.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 11:13:41</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Rui Valente is not due</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/automobilismo-rui-valente-nao-se-da-por-vencido/</link><description>Rui Valente will return this year for another season in motorsport in the region. The Macao pilot has been in the active for the same time and will play the Macau Roadsport Challenge, the tourist cars competition organized by the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), as well as the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix , in November
 
With the same enthusiasm recognized for decades, Rui Valente will again drive, in the 2025 season, a Subaru BRZ, the same car with which he competed in the Guide Circuit last November in the Macao Roadsport Challenge race. In the event held at the event of the territory, the Portuguese pilot finished sixth place, after losing some positions in the start, where he descended to tenth. The result was not even better because the rain -played race ended prematurely due to an opponent's accident.
In the competition for local pilots, which currently combines starting grids with more than half a hundred cars, all of them Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8), Rui Valente admitted to HM that “not being overcome”, revealing still who is “missing the podium, both in China and Macau…”.
Premium Racing Team driver had, in the last Macao Grand Prix, one of the fastest in terms of tip speed in the platoon of his race. Therefore, the bet for this year will be in other technical aspects of the car that go beyond the engine.
"At this time, I just wanted to increase the diameter of the front wheels and widen the gauge to improve the car's behavior," he confided to HM, also reporting that he intends to "optimize weight transmission during the curve and its. exit". These improvements, along with updates in the brake system, should increase the competitiveness of the Japanese machine in a fierce grid, consisting of Macau, Hong Kong pilots and China interior, with constantly evolving cars.
Undefined calendar
The AAMC -organized car competition calendar has not yet been revealed. In 2024, Macao Roadsport Challenge debuted at the Zhuzhou International Circuit in East of Hunan Province, but Rui Valente would rather the competition returned to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC) in Zhaoqing.
“I was very fond of returning to Gic, because I have everything there,” says the Portuguese pilot, defender of the track located in the neighboring province. “When you go to a qualification test, for those who make four races and then Macau, if you are on a track you already know, such as GIC, where you are seven or more years, each time you get on the track and try to do better than which last means you are improving and improving your driving. So you know you soon that you are stronger that year to Macau. ”
On the other hand, for the experienced pilot of the territory, “if you go to a new track, like the Zhuzhou circuit, besides floors there to learn the new layout and improve your time, you will never know if you are really stronger For Macao, as you know when you run in the gic. ”
Like what happened in past seasons, the Macau Roadsport Challenge calendar is expected to be composed of two weekends, with two races each, which also serve as an investigation for the Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:47:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorcycling | FHO RACING WITH NEW FOCUS IN 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/motociclismo-fho-racing-com-novo-foco-em-2025/</link><description>Doubts dissipated this week.

Peter Hickman goes to the fifth season in the British Championship with Fho Racing, however, before the season's start, some rumors came to circulate in Paddock about the team's future. In recent years, FHO Racing has become one of the top teams in the British Superbike Championship and road events, such as the MAN's island TT or the Macao Grand Prix.
Last November, the team announced that they featured Peter Hickman and Davey Todd, winner of the troubled last edition of the Macao Grand Motor Prize in the British Superbike Championship. Faye Ho said at the time that “for 2025 and also for this year's Macao Grand Prix, we have a very strong team, with Davey joining Pete and Michael aboard the BMW. We have two super talented drivers on the roads for next season, and with Davey jumping to the Superbike class, after winning the Superstock Championship for the second time, I think we'll have a strong season. I can't expect my team to return to Macau, I love to share my hometown with the team and show all points of interest, it's such a special place for me. ”
Although Hickman and Todd have been present at the BMW Motorrad Motorsport season in Berlin in mid -January, since November that Fho Racing has no news, which has generated some discomfort and doubts among fans.

It's not the first time
After a difficult season of his team in 2024 in the British Superbike Championship, Faye Ho, Stanley Ho's granddaughter, had to face similar rumors last September. In Oulton Park, before the opening race of the 2024 showdown, Faye Ho confirmed to journalists that FHO Racing would continue to participate in the British Superbike Championship of 2025, “which is good news, but anything will be announced to your time. But I'm happy to be back here and to stay here, it's a big championship and I love to be in this racing environment. ”
To increase speculation between fans, Hickman suggested on social networks a change of direction this year, leaving an announcement about his plans for the North West 200 and TT of the island of Man. In Spain, the British will have tested with the Your motorcycle without any reference and FHO Racing stickers, while Todd changed his profile photo on social networks, for a photo with a motorcycle from Milwaukee BMW by Tas Racing.
Sources of the world of motorcycling tell us that the future of the Racing should be known in the coming days, but one right thing is that Hickman, regardless of the team, has in his sports program to travel to MSAR in November, to try win the fifth victory in the guide circuit.</description><pubDate>2025-02-07 02:20:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Tennis | Nuno Borges will play in front of Alcaraz in the Australia Open</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/16/tenis-nuno-borges-vai-jogar-frente-a-alcaraz-no-open-da-australia/</link><description>Nuno Borges surpassed the nervousness to defeat Australian Jordan Thompson in three sets in the second round of Australia Open, and will now face 'Carlitos' Alcaraz without pressure, admitted the Portuguese tennis player to Lusa agency.
