The Senior Officials Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) announced that it has transferred the case to the Public Prosecutor's Office, which has the power to formally charge a South Korean head of state.
Cio considers that Yoon conspired with then-National Defense Minister Kim Yong-Hyun and other military officers to start a riot, declaring martial law on the night of December 3. It argues, moreover, that Yoon has abused power by sending troops to the National Assembly (Parliament) to prevent deputies from revoking martial law.
The Public Prosecution Service now has 11 days to decide whether or not to start the requested process. If Yoon is considered guilty of leading an insurrection, a crime for which a president has no immunity in the country, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment or the death penalty.
Yoon has been in pre-trial detention at the Seoul Detention Center, in Uiwang, south of Seoul, since January 15. The Constitutional Court is simultaneously holding a trial to determine whether or not to ratify the dismissal approved by parliamentarians on December 14th.
If the highest court in South Korea confirms the impeachment, early presidential elections have to be called within 60 days after the court decision. Yoon refuses to witness in the investigation into the alleged crime of rebellion.
Yoon Suk-Youol surprised the country on December 3 by declaring martial law, a measure reminiscent of black days of the South Korean military dictatorship and that justified with the intention of protecting the country from “North Korean Communist forces” and “Eliminate elements hostile to the state”.
Pressured by the deputies and thousands of protesters, Yoon was forced to revoke the decision hours later.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:30:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Contests | Deputies discussed “competitive negotiation”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/concursos-deputados-discutiram-negociacao-competitiva/</link><description>The possibility of Public Administration representatives directly negotiating public tender proposals with candidates was discussed yesterday in the 1st Permanent Committee of the Legislative Assembly. This novelty will be created by the public procurement law proposal, generally approved on January 11th of last year.
According to the explanations of Ella Law, chairman of the Commission, the possibility of the so -called “competitive negotiation” with candidates is a novelty of the law, but can only be used in three situations: when all public tender proposals are refused, although without amending Substantially the contest charges book, when the work is too complex, which makes it impracticable to establish a previous price for the proposals, or when the nature of the works make it impossible to set the prior fixation of a price.
According to the newspaper Ou Mun, the proposed law establishes that when the Administration chooses to avoid public tendering, and requests proposals from a certain number of companies, consultation must be carried out with at least five companies. However, Ella Lei indicated that deputies are concerned that the alleged “randomness” of the companies consulted is not guaranteed or results in a fair procedure, so this aspect will be discussed with the Executive.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:49:03</pubDate></item><item><title>STD | Dismantled six illegal pensions in 12 days</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/dst-desmanteladas-seis-pensoes-ilegais-em-12-dias/</link><description>The Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) set up an illegal pensions operation, between January 1 and 12, in the way of preparation for the Lunar New Year's holidays, in which six pensions that were illegally operated were dismantled .

In addition to the more than 160 pieces of gold and silver, the Cultural Institute challenges the public to know the craft practices of working the precious metals in workshops
 
The Tap Seac Gallery is exhibiting until the 23rd of February “Brilliance of Art – Exhibition of Gold and Silver Crafts from the Provinces of Hebei and Guizhou”, an exhibition that introduces the Macau public to traditional goldsmithing and crafts from the two Chinese provinces and the ancestral way of working gold and silver.
Organized by the Cultural Institute, the exhibition is part of the series of activities to celebrate the Lunar New Year of the Serpent, presenting “more than 160 pieces and sets of jewelry and exquisite gold and silver articles”. The works “present sophisticated formats, a very high degree of technical refinement and a variety of styles. Inheriting long-standing traditional techniques and incorporating a modern aesthetic, the traditional art pieces radiate a contemporary aura”, describes the IC in a statement.
As the name of the exhibition implies, the pieces are a reflection of the art -embedded art and Chinese art in Cloisonné (technique of application of thin gold strips on metal surfaces, usually bronze) of Hebei province. The exhibition also presents the goldsmith of the Miao ethnic group of the province of Guizhou. Both cultural manifestations are in the national list of representative items of China's intangible cultural heritage.
 
 
Cultural preciousness
The art of creating gold and silver pieces is a type of traditional Chinese craftsmanship with over 3000 years of history.
The IC indicates that the pieces of filigree inlaid art and Chinese cloisonné art from Hebei are characterized by a high degree of technical refinement, the diversity of their motifs and their dazzling ornamentation, possessing great artistic value. In turn, the goldsmithing of the Miao ethnic group from Guizhou denotes a multiplicity of cultural connotations, giving rise to works with a markedly ethnic style, with excellent artistic taste.
The Miao ethnic group is one of the largest in the interior of China, encompassing about 56 dialects and ethnicities. Miao live mainly in the mountainous regions of southern China. In addition to the province of Guizhou, the ethnic group is set in areas in the provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Haião and even Guangdong.
Guided tours will also be made available to the exhibition on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, with the Sessions in Cantonense scheduled for 15h and Mandarin for 4:15 pm.
 
Learn with the Master
In addition to the exhibition, which can be visited free of charge from 10am to 7pm, including public holidays, the IC will organize workshops in the Activities Room of the Xian Xinghai Memorial Museum, at Rua Francisco Xavier Pereira, nº 151-153, in Macau.
“In order to allow the public to have more direct contact with the gold and silver crafts on display”, the IC will organize four workshops on the 8th and 9th of February. On February 8th, from 10am to 12pm and 3pm to 5pm, an instructor will present techniques of Hebei filigree inlaid art.

The recovery of real estate and consumer confidence levels in the interior of China will be determining factors
 
Casinos' revenues can grow up to 7 percent in the lunar year of the serpent, depending on the recovery of the Chinese real estate and confidence, but they will be away from the pre-pound peak, analysts told Lusa.
“The biggest positive factor for Macau would be if the Chinese economy grew and consumer confidence levels improved,” said Vitaly Umansky, analyst at the consultancy firm Seaport Research Partners.
More than 70 percent of people who visited the territory in 2024 came from mainland China, whose economic growth reached the 5 percent target set by Beijing in 2024.
But Nicholas Chenist, Creditsights analyst, said the company of the Financial Notation Agency group Fitch expects a 4.7 percent slowdown this year, in part due to weak private consumption.
The consumer confidence index in China fell in September to the lowest level of the last 34 years, stressed Jeffrey Kiang, analyst at Consultant CLSA. That is, "if the prospects for Chinese consumers are not good, they will be able to tighten their belt, reduce travel and consumption," including Macao, Nicholas Chen explained.
 
Stimulus Policies
The Chinese Communist Party has launched a series of stimulus measures, including reducing interest rates and bank reserve requirements and bringing forward billions of billions from its budget in 2025 to finance construction projects.
Beijing also expanded a consumer goods exchange system and raised the salaries of millions of public servants to revive domestic demand. “The [Chinese] Government has already said that it will launch more measures to stimulate the economy”, said Vitaly Umansky, who hopes above all for a recovery in confidence among the middle class: “I think it will happen, it’s just a matter of time”.
CreditSights expects Chinese consumer confidence to rise again in the second half of 2025, alongside the stabilization of real estate prices, which have been falling for 19 consecutive months.
The issue concerns a lot of Beijing, due to the implications for social stability, since housing is one of the main investment vehicles of families and the real estate sector - adding indirect factors - represents about 30 percent of the Chinese economy.
“There will certainly be some side effects, because part of the measures that are adopted to boost domestic consumption could flow to the Macau gaming sector”, said Nicholas Chen.
The analyst believes that China will also expand the list of cities whose residents can apply for 'individual visas' to visit Hong Kong and Macau, a method used by 35.2 percent of tourists who passed through Macau in 2024.
 
Different views
Vitaly Umansky has no opinion and recalls that since January 1 residents of the neighboring city of Zhuhai can visit Macau once a week and stay up to seven days.
On the other hand, analysts agree that casino revenues will be next year away from the maximum historical 303 billion patacas recorded in 2018.
"One thing is clear: the government aims to moderately growth in revenues in the future," said Jeffrey Kiang, recalling authorities predict gaming revenues of 240 billion in 2025, which would be a 5.8 percent increase. .
“When the Macau Government publishes a forecast, it is usually very conservative and is based on prior discussion with the Liaison Office” of the Chinese Central Government in the city, said Vitaly Umansky.
The analyst does not believe that Beijing has any measures up its sleeve to control the resumption of casinos, similar to the campaign that began with the arrest of the leader of the largest VIP betting company in the world, in November 2021.
The former executive director of Suncity, Alvin Chau Cheok Wa, was sentenced in January 2023 to 18 years in prison for illicit gambling and secret society exploitation, in a case that saw the number of licenses for gambling promoters drop from 85 to 18, known as 'junkets'. “Much of the reprehensible behavior in Macau disappeared with the junkets. As long as things like that don't happen again, I don't expect any kind of campaign in the short term,” said Umansky.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Traffic | Lawyer appeals to the end of “moral judgments” with images</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/transito-advogado-apela-ao-fim-de-julgamentos-morais-com-imagens/</link><description>The causal Luís Ho Ka considers that the use of traffic chambers can lead to cases in court, and that the images captured must be sent to the authorities, rather than shared on social networks
 
Lawyer Luís Ho Ka Hou defends the use of surveillance cameras in traffic by drivers, but calls on the Government to take measures to avoid using the images for “moral judgments”. The lawyer's opinion was shared with the newspaper Ou Mun, following an incident in front of the Portuguese School of Macau, in which images of a lawyer of Portuguese nationality were shared.
Heard by the newspaper Ou Mun, the lawyer considered that recording videos by cameras installed in vehicles can be important, particularly when there are accidents and the need to activate car insurance. However, Ho Ka Hou highlighted that vehicle cameras cannot be turned into a mobile surveillance system used to make “moral judgments” on social media.
Ho also explained that the images captured by the vehicles must be handed over to the authorities, instead of being published online, and that those responsible for the recording must only send them to the authorities, following the legal procedures provided. If the images are of public interest, they can be used. However, if the use of images goes beyond the scope of the authorities' process and investigations, as happens with publications on social networks, and if there are elements that can be considered insulting or defamatory, then the person responsible for capturing and disseminating them may face criminal liability.
 
Legal problems
Luís Ho Ka Hou also indicated that, according to the judicial perspective, the appropriate use of images recorded in traffic involves capturing accidents, activating the insurance and cooperating with the authorities, in case it is necessary to collect evidence.
If there is no consent of the recorded people, and if the content is published on social networks for moral judgments, then we are facing cases that are hardly under the appropriate recording, which may lead to violation of the law of personal data protection or other image rights.
Ho ka has also warned that “judgments” on social networks can cause damage to the rights to privacy and the good name of the parties involved.
About two weeks ago, a driver was caught in traffic, after running a red light, parking in a prohibited area and making an obscene gesture, near children. The images, which allowed the driver to be identified, were shared online, which led to a campaign against the target, including requests for dismissal from the employer, in addition to several hateful comments with xenophobic expressions.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 10:51:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Portugal | Rocha Vieira “decisive” for democracy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/portugal-rocha-vieira-decisivo-para-a-democracia/</link><description>The Assembly of the Republic unanimously approved a vote of condolence proposed by José Pedro Aguiar-Branco, in which Rocha Vieira is considered a relevant personality in the construction of Portuguese democracy

“Undulating Connections” is, according to a USJ statement, “a dynamic building that offers a specialized space for regional and global events”, being situated “in a geographical position” with a lot of meaning. “The design concept of the project is inspired by the light reflexes of Lake Nam Van, verified on the front of the building”, also verifying “the interaction of curved roofs, starting with a smooth angle, similar to a one mountain, and that creates an engaging space experience ”.
Furthermore, the project for this building “has two exhibition rooms, an auditorium, two galleries, a public exhibition area, a café and a viewpoint”, being intended “for a 'networking' center, to support tourism, to encourage economic growth and increase intercultural interaction in Macau”, if it were built.
Vera Vong's thesis project was selected, initially, by the Macau Architects Association to compete for the ARCASIA – Architects Regional Council Asia TOY Award.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:22:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Afghanistan | Beijing calls for severe punishment for perpetrators of murder of Chinese citizen</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/afeganistao-pequim-pede-punicao-severa-para-autores-do-assassinio-de-cidadao-chines/</link><description>China yesterday called on the Afghan authorities to carry out a “thorough investigation” and “severely punish” those responsible for the murder, on Wednesday, of a Chinese citizen who worked in a gold mine in the Afghan province of Takhar.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a press conference yesterday that Beijing is “deeply shocked” by the attack. “China is against all forms of terrorism”, stressed the spokesperson, calling for “the repression of the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations listed by the UN Security Council”.
“China will continue to pay close attention to the security situation in Afghanistan and support the Afghan authorities in combating all forms of terrorist violence and maintaining security and stability in the country,” Mao added, urging the Afghan government to take necessary measures “to ensure the security of Chinese citizens and organizations in the country”.
According to local police, the victim worked in a gold mine in the region, which borders Tajikistan. A local branch of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. China is one of the few international actors that has maintained diplomatic relations with Afghanistan since the Taliban came to power in August 2021.
The two countries share a small international border of just 76 kilometers in the easternmost part of the so-called Wajan Corridor, a remote pass in the Pamir mountain range.
Chinese companies, with support from Beijing, have sought to seize opportunities to exploit Afghanistan's vast deposits of undeveloped resources, especially the Mes Aynak mine, which is believed to contain the world's largest copper deposit.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:18:39</pubDate></item><item><title>ICBC | Bank tries to collect Alvin Chau's debt</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/icbc-banco-tenta-cobrar-divida-de-alvin-chau/</link><description>The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC, in English) is executing housing for businessman Alvin Chau, who is currently detained at the Coloane Prison.

Goethe, who was always passionate about Chinese civilization, glossed the ancient principle of Socrates, the Greek, “the more I know, the more I know that I know nothing” and wrote “Man only knows when he knows that he knows little. With knowledge, doubt grows.” And Confucius 孔夫子, who also knew a lot about life and his people, said, six centuries before Christ: “If you know, act as a man who knows. If you don't know, recognize that you don't know; That’s knowing!”
The old Chinese are wise, a wisdom based on five thousand years of history and stories. The old Chinese are intelligent, an intelligence acquired over many, many hard and intensely lived centuries.
Lao Zi, 老子 (600 BC ? – 510 BC, ?) the patriarch of philosophical Taoism, wrote in chapter 2 of his Tao Te Ching:
Under the sky, [1] we all see that the beautiful is beautiful
because the ugly exists.
We all know that good is good
because the bad exists.
Coexist being and non-being,
the difficult and the easy are completed,
the top and bass approach,
voice and sound harmonize,
The front and the back follow one another.
Therefore, the wise man advances and does nothing,[2]
teaches without saying anything
and the ten thousand beings develop, without ceasing.
He works and owns nothing,
He creates and appropriates nothing.
All done, all forgotten,
thus, forever, the work remains.[3]
The amazing Lie Zi 列子 (450 BC-376 A. C.) who, according to Taoist tradition was able to ride winds and clouds, says in his book, chap. II, 11:
“Two boys lived by the sea and loved the seagulls. Every morning they played in the middle of the birds and many other seagulls, to the hundreds, poisted with them. One day the father told them:
‘I know they play with the seagulls. They get some and bring them. I also want to have fun. '
The next day, the boys arrived on the edge of the sea, the seagulls hovered in the air and not left on the beach.
In conclusion, the best of all speeches is the one that does not use words, the perfect performance is to act without acting, the wisdom of the wisest of the wise is always shallow.”
Another story of the book of Lie Zi, in Chapter VII, 32:
“A peasant didn't know where his ax was. He then suspected that his neighbor's son had stolen and began to watch the boy carefully. He had exactly the modes of a thief of axes, the words he pronounced sounded the thief with axes, all his behavior and attitudes were those of someone who had stolen an ax.
But suddenly, digging the earth, the peasant found his ax.
The next day the man looked again at the neighbor's son. He then noticed that the modes, words, behavior, and attitudes of the boy were by no means of those of a thief with axes. ”
Chinese wisdom has almost always escaped Western intelligence. West and East hardly interpenetrate, they look at the Sobrency, sometimes with distrust, and above all ignore.
I will mention a curious recent example:
In 1970, in his “final will,” Russian Nikita Kruchtchev wrote, about Mao Zedong: “I was never sure to understand what he meant. He thought at that time that this was related to certain aspects of the Chinese mindset and the way of thinking of the Chinese. Some statements of Mao shocked me for its simplicity, others for its complexity. I never knew safely what Mao's position. It is impossible, with the Chinese, to know in which law. ”
It is true that Russian thought and Chinese thought have not always understood each other. The Sino-Soviet conflict, which began in the late 1950s, was, in addition to political differences, a clash of cultures and, strange as it may seem in two communist countries, a conflict between diverse, differentiated conceptions of the world.
A few years ago, in Beijing, my friend Li Shunbao, a co-worker at the Beijing Editions in Foreign Languages, told me about a small dialogue that took place in 1961 between Khrushchev and Zhou Enlai, then first- Chinese minister. Relations between the two countries were already quite bad and, after a bitter discussion about political issues, Khrushchev decided to be “nice” to Zhou Enlai and told him:
“Despite our differences, we have a lot in common. We both believe in Marxism, you are Prime Minister, so am I, and you and I are responsible for the Government of two of the greatest nations in the world. But there is a big difference between us, I am the son of peasants and you are the son of mandarins.”
Zhou Enlai, who, in fact, was not a son but grandson of a mandarin, smiled and replied, “Sorry, this is not a difference, it is another resemblance. It means that we are both traitors. ” “TRAINORS?!… How?…” Asked Kruchtchev. "Well, both traitors because the Lord betrayed the peasants and I betrayed the mandarins."
By the way of politics and politicians, philosopher Han Fezi 韓非子 wrote 240 years before the birth of Christ:
“You can generally expect about ten honest men in each kingdom, which is an excellent average. But the state must count a hundred positions. Hence there is more official than good men to occupy them, which gives ten honest men and ninety rascals to fill all these places. It can therefore be betting that the result will be widespread disorder, more than an organized government. This is why the sensible sovereign believes in a system and not in individual abilities, has faith in a method and suspects personal probity. ”
Han Fezi was the greatest theorist of the Fa Jia 法 家 法 家, known in the West as the legislation. He would die poisoned in a prison, perhaps because he forgot one of the exemplary quotes of Confucius "The honest man tells the truth, the fool tells the whole truth." In any case, its principles would have great influence on modern China and Mao Zedong itself.
Zhuang Zi 庄子(369-286 B.C.), the greatest of Taoist thinkers, one of the great poets of freedom, tells us this story:
“It was Zhuang Zi fishing on the river bank when two mandarins arrived by the Prince of Zhou.
— Our prince wishes to see you and name you prime minister of the kingdom of Zhou.
Zhuang Zi continued to fish and, without going back to his head, replied:
"I heard that in the kingdom of Zhou there is a sacred turtle that was killed many, many years ago." The prince retains this closed turtle in the temple of the ancestors and worships his carapace. Would the turtle be like to be dead and have its remains venerated, or would you rather be alive, shaking the tail in the mud of the swamps?
“I would rather be alive, shaking the tail in the mud of the swamps, answered the mandarins.
— You can leave, said Zhuang Zi. I also prefer to wag my tail in the mud of the swamps.”
In China, more than in any other country in the world, we see how, century after century, the continuity of ideas, traditions, uses and customs manifests itself.
Mao Zedong, who knew well the cultural foundation of his homeland, sometimes cited the old philosophers and the stories of popular tradition, for the benefit of the ideology he defended. This is how, in 1945, Mao speaks of one of these stories:
“In ancient China there was a fable titled 'How Yukong removed the mountains'. This fable says that in times that go there, he lived in northern China an old man named Yukong. On the south side, in front of his house, were two large mountains, Taihang and Wangwu, which prevented his passage. Driving his children, Yukong decided to rock the mountains to pick -up blows. Seeing them in such a work, another old man named Chezzou, untied to laugh and said to them, ‘What a foolishness! Alone, you will never be able to rock these two mountains. ' Yukong replied:
‘When I die will be my children; When, in turn, they die, my grandchildren will be, and thus succeeding the generations uninterrupted. As for these two mountains, however high, they can no longer grow and, with each pick of pick, they become smaller. Why can't we drag them? 'And Yukong continued, unshakable, to cut the stone, day after day, which moved the God of heaven who sent two angels to the earth who carried and took the two mountains. Today there are also two mountains that weigh on the Chinese people: imperialism and feudalism. The Communist Party of China has long decided to draft them. We must be persevering and work without rest, for we can also move the God from heaven. For us, the God of heaven is nothing but the mass of the Chinese people. ”
One of the characteristics of Chinese thought is the unity of opposites, the complementarity and permanent transformation of opposites, movement and dialectics, the annulment of contradictions and the immediate appearance of renewed contradictions that are always insoluble because, when resolved, they give rise to new ones. contradictions.
In the twenties of the 20th century, the philosopher Chen Lifu 陳立夫 wrote things like these:
“As men do not look like, their analogies are characterized by seven periods. In the first, the strong tolerates the weak; In the second, the strong despises the weak; In the third, the strong enslaves the weak; In the room, the strong has piety of the weak; In the fifth, the fort becomes weak; In the sixth, the weak protects the fort; In the seventh, the weak and the strong are confused. ”
Returning to Zhuang Zi and his edifice of Taoist wisdom, twenty-three centuries old, we read:
“The universe as such is not an expression of the absolute. Everything changes, over time, in the course of evolution, according to what begins and what ends. Science teaches that things change appearance and that the absolute becomes relative. Therefore, the distance between big and small is blurred, between what comes before and what comes after in a chain that has no end.”
And later, in his Book of Zhuang Zi, the master says:
“Those who claim to exist the right and the righteous without their correlative, the incorrect and the unfair, or the good government without their correlative, the bad government, do not understand the great principles of the universe or the essence of all creation. How can we speak of the existence of heaven without referring to the existence of the earth, or the negative principle without referring to the positive principle?
However, there are still people who continue these endless discussions. These people are either crazy or they are naive. ”
The apparent statism of Eastern civilizations has a lot to do with the cyclical nature of their thinking. Also with its wisdom, very different from our Western one, so linked to the old Greek logic and the apparent Judeo-Christian dynamism.
Here is another very ancient story of Chinese Taoism, now taken from Huainanzi 淮南子, a classic of Chinese philosophy dating back to the 2nd century BC:
“A poor old peasant had a horse and the animal ran away. At night, the neighbors came to express their condolences, telling him that he had had very bad luck. The peasant simply replied: ‘Maybe’. The next day, the horse returned accompanied by six wild mares. At night, the neighbors came to congratulate the peasant, telling him that he had been very lucky after all. The man simply replied: ‘Maybe’. The next day, the peasant's son rode one of the wild mares, but fell and broke his leg. At night, the neighbors came to lament the peasant's bad luck and he simply replied: 'Maybe'. The next day, government officials responsible for recruiting young people for the army arrived in the village, finding the empire in time of war. The peasant's son didn't go to the battlefield because he had a broken leg. In the evening, the neighbors came to congratulate him once again on his good luck and the old man simply replied: 'Maybe.'
Now an old apologist, by Pe Yu King, that no one knows who it is but has been written for fourteen centuries:
“Once a monk, a bandit, a painter, a miser and a wise man traveled together. Night fell and they took shelter in a cave.
— You couldn't find a better place for a hermitage, exclaimed the monk.
— What a great refuge for robbers, said the bandit.
- The light of the dock, these shadow games, which extraordinary motives for the brush!, The painter murmured in turn.
"But what a great place to hide a treasure!"
The wise man listened in silence and finally said:
— What a wonderful cave!”
In China, nothing is ever exactly what it seems. It may be, it may not be, it all depends on subtle or clumsy understandings of each person, their perspective, their gaze. In the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty, the scholar Yuan Jing 袁晶 told the interesting story of a cat. Like this:
A court mandarin named Ji owned a magnificent cat. He was so proud of the feline that he decided to name him Tiger. One day, during an evening at his house with several friends, everyone started talking about the cat. One of them said:
"It is true that the tiger is a powerful animal, but the dragon has even more power." Why not call Dragon to the cat?
Another intervened:
"IDmit the dragon is more powerful than the tiger, but he has to rise in the air to reach the clouds." It seems to me therefore evident that the clouds are stronger than the dragon. Why not call cloud to the cat?
A third said then:
"The clouds can cover the whole earth, but they can't resist the wind that disperses them quickly." Why not call the cat wind?
A fourth guest added:
— What can the wind do in front of a stone wall? Why not call the cat Muro?
A fifth friend later argued:
— A wall is capable of resisting the wind, but rats know how to make holes in a wall. Why not call the cat Mouse?
An old man from Dongli village listened to the entire conversation silently. Finally, he asked:
- What is the name the animal that hunts rats?
Our João de Barros (1496-1570), excellent 16th century chronicler, in its Asia, third decade, where more than one hundred pages that dedicated to China and the Chinese world enter, wrote around 1550:
“The Chinese say that they have two eyes of understanding about all things, we, those of Europe, after communicating with each other, have one eye, and all other nations are blind.”

Han Feizi was the greatest theoretician of the Fa Jia 法家 school, known in the West as Legism. He would die of poisoning in prison, perhaps because he had forgotten one of Confucius' exemplary quotes: “the honest man tells the truth, the fool tells the whole truth.” In any case, his principles would exert great influence on modern China and on Mao Zedong himself.
Zhuang Zi 庄 子 子 (369-286 A. C.), the greatest of the Taoist thinkers, one of the great poets of freedom, tells us this story:
“It was Zhuang Zi fishing on the river bank when two mandarins arrived by the Prince of Zhou.

Now would the turtle prefer to be dead and have its remains venerated, or would it prefer to be alive, wagging its tail in the mud of the swamps?
“I would rather be alive, shaking the tail in the mud of the swamps, answered the mandarins.
"You can leave," said Zhuang Zi. I also prefer to shake the tail in the mud of the swamps. ”

On the south side, in front of his house, there were two large mountains, Taihang and Wangwu, which blocked his way. Leading his sons, Yukong decided to level the mountains with a pickaxe. Seeing them at such work, another old man named Chezou burst out laughing and said to them: 'How foolish! Alone, you will never be able to demolish these two mountains’. Yukong replied:
‘When I die, my children will remain; When, in turn, they die, my grandchildren will remain, and so generations will continue uninterruptedly. As for these two mountains, no matter how high they are, they can no longer grow any further and, with each blow of the pickaxe, they become smaller. Why can't we raze them?' And Yukong continued, unwavering, to cut the stone, day after day, which moved the god of heaven who sent two angels to Earth who carried and carried the two mountains. Today there are also two mountains that weigh on the Chinese people: imperialism and feudalism. The Communist Party of China has long since decided to destroy them. We must be persevering and work tirelessly, as we can also move the god of heaven. For us, the god of heaven is none other than the mass of the Chinese people.”

In Dantu, one of the three districts of Zhenjiang (Jiangsu) where he lived more than four decades, his memory is celebrated in a unique park in the country where one can observe a thousand and three hundred copies of stone -caligrah recordings. By alluding to its source of inspiration, it was properly conceived in the hill of the ten LI, with its own aspects of the painting of landscapes.
The admirable novelty of his art was praised by Emperor Huizong (R.1100-1125), who knew him and which in his vertical roll of the awakening of clouds (silk ink, 150 x 78.8 cm in Smithonian) transcribed the Confucius phrase that underlines what will be noted in so -called Shanshui paintings, "rivers and the mountains" in continuous mutation: "Before the sky sends the rains of the season, mountains and rivers presented the clouds."
In the paintings of Mi Fu, this look is noted to the mutant fluid forms where the spirit could be revealed, unlike the design of animals or people who have stabilized forms.
Its legacy was also and above all cultivated by painters over time. Pan Sim (1756-1839) Already in the last dynasty seven hundred years later was one of those who used the horizontal points applied with brush on paper, figuring successive mountains backwards that characterized the method of Mi Fu.
Pan Simu like Zhang Yin or Pan Gongshou, painters from the city of Zhenjiang, sought to establish a "school" (father) of painting based on the city's tradition. In this inquiry into memory, Pan Simu realized his affinity with Mi Fu. He did so, for example, in two vertical scrolls: The Crane Forest (Helin) misty in the rain (ink on paper, 128.9 x 31.4 cm, at the Minneapolis Institute of Art); and in Rain and Fog in Helin (ink on paper, 109.9 x 31.8 cm, at the Metmuseum).
In the latter, he says a visit to the temple where Mi fu's tomb was on the mountain of yellow grrou (Huanghe Shan) writing a poem in which the expression "old fool", Laodian, is a characteristic manifestation of affective familiarity a little harsh with which They treated the adherents of the DAO; «The great reputation of the grou forest extends for years and years,/ There I stayed overnight once in the spring and there I did this painting reminding old fool. coming to steal my meditation on Chan? »</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves,

The year 2025 will be commanded by the wooden serpent yin (乙巳蛇 yǐ sì shé), that is, from the sixth terrestrial branch, from the wood element linked to the female principle, therefore to lunar, mysterious and intuitive force. It begins, in official terms of the Lunissolar calendar, on January 29, 2025 and ends on February 16, 2026, but for Geomancia or Fengshui (风水 Fēngshuǐ) The year only opens February 3 in the first spring, Lichun (立春 Lìchūn ). This year, from the point of view of the telluric blessings, it will be particularly awarded because it will have two spring, with a second Lichun on February 4, 2026.
And as for the descendants of the dragon “good things come to peers” (好事成双 hǎo shì chéng shuāng), promises good agriculture and fertility, being equally conducive to meditation and contact with nature, but also social contacts, because The wooden serpent, given its element, is the most communicative, creative, friendly and favorable to relationships between these reptiles. Moreover, this type of wood is defined by being a hardworking, honest and popular, it is not always recognized, so it brings the virtue of perseverance, which gives it the recognition of its efforts over time.
She is “the serpent that comes out of the hole” (Kwok, 1997, 67). It belongs to the time period between 9 am and 11 am. Although its fixed element is fire, as for example wood is that of the tiger, and its constant color is, depending on the element, red, in 2025 green, associated with Wood, will predominate.
The serpent is the strongest sexual symbol and, therefore, in Indian yogic philosophies of the tantric line, which extend throughout Asia and, in particular, Southeast Asia, it is kundalini, as C.G. pointed out. Jung in The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga. Notes to a Seminar Given in 1932.
How do the Chinese relate to the serpent's vital force? At first they were quite spontaneous, they had an animistic philosophy that evolved into popular Taoism, but we must not forget that also from a very early age, starting with Confucius and the establishment of Confucianism, and in a systematic way since Han times, there have been In this culture there is a great determination to control natural energies. This trend redoubled with the acceptance of Buddhist philosophy, initially very distant from natural and tantric experiences.
During the time of the last Qing dynasty, religious experiences linked to Buddhism intensified and, as such, the conflict between natural and spiritual forces became manifest, opening a war similar to what we assist in Christianity, with Eve and Adam to be expelled from paradise because of a supposedly infamous serpent.
The open war between natural forces and formal religion would still be recorded in Chinese literature, in one of the most poignant love stories, entitled to White Serpent (Bai Shé Zhuàn), also known by the names of its protagonists Xu Xian (许仙 xǔ Xiān) and bai niangzi (白娘子 Bai niángzi), which reached the heyday during the Qing dynasty.
In it, the lovers are hopelessly persecuted by a Buddhist bonzo, who destroys their happiness by insisting that Xu Xian (许仙) stay away from Bai Niangzi (白娘子), since she was an enchanted serpent.
Omitted by Bonzo would be the meditation effort that led the serpent to transfigure itself in human form.
What the Buddhist bonzo did not see, as many Christian religious people still fail to understand, is that on the exterior of what appears to be transgression there is hidden a natural and spontaneous force closely linked to the mind of those who deal with it. For a pure mind, natural force has nothing impure, for a clouded mind, force is, in the Western version, sin, and in the Eastern version, negative and demonic power.
The strength of the serpent is complete in itself. There is nothing to add to you. Attesting to its perfect completeness, there is a very told proverbial story, drawing feet to the serpent (畫/画蛇添足 huà shiān zú), often shortened in the expression the serpent feet (shé zú 蛇足).
Article帮忙办事的人很多，这壶酒如果大家都喝是不够的，若是让一个人喝，那能喝得有余。这一壶酒到底怎么分呢？大家都安静下来，这时有人建议：每个人在地上画一条蛇，谁画得快，这壶酒就归他喝。大家都认为这个方法Article
有个人画得很快 ， 一转眼最先画好了 ， 他就端起酒壶要喝酒。但是他回头看看别人 ， 还都没有画好呢。心里想：他们画得真慢。他洋洋得意地说： “你们画得好慢啊！我再给蛇画几只脚也不算晚呢！” 于是 ， 他便左手提着酒壶 ， 右手给蛇画起脚来。正在他一边给蛇画脚 ， 一边说话的时候 ， ， ， 另外一个人已经画好了。那个人马上把酒壶从他手里夺过去 “你见过蛇吗？蛇是没有脚的 ， 你为什么要给它添上脚呢？所以第一个画好蛇的人不是你 ， 而是我了！ ”那个人说罢就仰起头来 ， 咕咚咕咚把酒喝下去了。
Here's my translation:
In ancient times, in the Kingdom Chu (楚國/国 Chǔ Guó), there was a feudal gentleman who, after giving the appropriate ritual libations to the ancestors, still left a jar of wine, which he thought to distribute to his employees. But since these were many, the wine didn't come to everyone, but for one it would be more than enough. After all, how did it be shared? To calm down one of them suggested, "Each one will draw a snake on the floor, which end first, will get the jar of wine." Everyone agreed with the idea and so began to draw. There was one who was full of desire to drink him, so he dispatched the drawing in an open and close eye.
When he looked at the others, he saw that they hadn't finished yet, so he thought they were very slow and said triumphantly: "You are so slow that I even have time to add feet to the snake!" Then, while holding the jar with his left hand, he added the reptile's feet with his right hand. At the time I was drawing his feet and talking, someone else finished his drawing; Taking the jar from his hand, he said: “Have you ever seen a snake? If they don't have feet, why did you add them?! Therefore, the first one to draw a snake is not you, but me.” When he finished speaking, he raised his head and Gluglu downed his wine.
In a stylistic equivalent to Portuguese, the first winner had blurred the painting. In an ontological reading, there is nothing to add to a complete force in itself. Therefore, this said is used to show someone to do something superfluous.
When the snake intends to be someone else, it has opened the path of metamorphosis, similar to that of the silkworm and the butterfly.
The Chinese are well aware of the power of the serpent (shé 蛇), whose etymological reading is the worm radically another, the animal, the antithetical force of the civilized. This immense natural energy was renamed as a little dragon (小龙 Xiǎo Lóng) to make room for the reptile to cultivate and exercise on the spiritual way, in an inner body to mind, without, however, losing its telluric roots. The serpent crawls on Earth, if he can rise to heaven as a flying dragon, united the two primordial forces of the universe, that of heaven and that of the earth, within the human body and outside the cosmic body.

The building in the middle of the square, although it seems like a government site, is the city's exhibition room. In the west, two large shopping centers, one with cinema, extend the street where we are taken to the great canal's anchorage. In a small guard at the entrance of the boarding pier, the boat tickets are sold to Suzhou [we are in the late 90s] and every day a boat in the evening, on a trip made night in the night Jiangnan Channel [Jiangnan Yunhe (江南运河)]. Once, the route went to Wuxi, but this service was disconnected for two years.
The Jiangnan channel begins in Zhenjiang, on the south bank of Changjiang (Yangzi or Yangtzé), after the Great Channel crosses the third largest river in the world, and to south follows its course by Danyang (丹阳), Changzhou (常州), Wuxi (无锡), Suzhou (苏州), Pingwang (平望), arriving in Hangzhou where he connects to the Qianantang River.
At the counter, which seemed to guard the alley leading to the boarding gate, we bought a small one-bed ticket in a bunk compartment for 98 yuan for the next day, as two-bed cabins cost 115 yuan are sold out. They ask us to arrive at five in the afternoon, half an hour before departure.
He looked at the pier from where two years before he had left by boat to Suzhou and returned now prepared to repeat the trip, but when he arrived at the pier I find it being demolished. The boats of these trips are still anchored, but these have now been suspended indefinitely. By chance, we realize the movement registered at the bottom of the pier, with people waiting next to a triangle sign indicating the boat stop. Asking, we found no trip to the former Nanxingqiao (南星桥) boarding pier, situated shortly before reaching the Sanlang Temple, near the Southern Bus Terminal.
Now a boat career was open, which on a short ten -minute trip to downstream, touched by brief moments at Baziqiao Zhan (坝子桥站), next to the Bazi Bridge (坝子桥), then returning to the pier where we had party. By five yuan we can look at one of the city's channels, which although closed lets down water to the large channel and looking like an attractive place, a bridge with three arches covered by a wooden roof is the door of a branch of channel.
Also for five yuan, we are taken to the ancient Gongchen Bridge, next to the square where the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal Museum is located. And so we returned to visit this excellent museum, which created a new tourist hub for the city of Hangzhou.
Models of boats are on display there, and you can see the routes of maritime travel over the centuries and the centuries of construction of the Grand Canal, its sponsors and the way in which the obstacles presented were resolved to make this route a direct connection between the capital of the North and the rest of China.
On the big channel
Only with the new opening of the country to tourism held in 1978 came the interest to take a new benefit from this great engineering work. By the great channel the goods were still transported, although parts of the route were interrupted, as navigation had been abandoned since the late nineteenth century. In response, in 1981 Wuxi's tourist entities opened a trip between Suzhou and Yangzhou and another, from Tai Lake to Hangzhou.
The boat made available to tourism was a faithful replica of Emperor Sui's dragon boat, Yangdi. In the late 1990s, the trips are between Hangzhou and Suzhou and then to Wuxi the boats are normal two-story passenger boats. Then, in the second or third year after the beginning of the III Millennium, the trip ceased to be made for Wuxi and was only made between Hangzhou and Suzhou and in the year 2007 it was interrupted. We believe, to restructure and prepare new boats for tourists to enjoy the beauties of the landscapes and the history of the great channel.
At five in the afternoon we arrived at the pier, half an hour before departure. Fifteen minutes past the hour, at a quarter to six we are sailing through the waters of the Grand Canal. The delay was due to the bicycles of the cycle tourism group having to be packed onto the boat, arriving just before departure time.
The boat we are traveling on has two floors and approximately twenty cabins, with common bathrooms, a kitchen and a small lounge, where meals, dinner and breakfast are taken.
The trip will be made at night through the region known as Jiangnan [South of the River], which crosses the lands south of the Changjiang (Yangzi River), in the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, from which the name of the canal built in the Qin dynasty in 85 km long and widened by 605. From Hangzhou it passes through the lands of Huzhou and Jiaxing and leaving the province of Zhejiang it enters the province of Jiangsu and skirting Lake Tai to the east, it follows to Suzhou, where our trip will end by boat.
From Hangzhou we would leave to Suzhou, comparing the Venetian traveler Marco Polo, twin cities at the level of beauty, paradise on Earth.
The night falls into Hangzhou when we crossed the Gongzhen Bridge, built in 1631 all of the stone with three arches and that brings us awakened on the deck, despite raining, for starting the non -navigated route. A passenger boat passes by transporting only one person, not being strange because the fog and drizzle all afternoon removes the pleasure of the trip.
The poplar trees lining the cobbled banks are suddenly lit by the red lanterns of an old-style waterfront restaurant waiting for customers. The beauty of the landscape is perhaps only due to the shadows at night.
Boat traffic is intense and all are cargo boats, some large, which can fit containers, others transporting sand, coal or wooden logs. The boat, with its flat hull and U-shaped bow, sails shallowly along the water's edge. At the stern of the vessel, at the top of the cabin, there are the signal lights, with the green one on the right side and the red one on the left. It uses an intense white spotlight to illuminate the channel from the front and when crossing paths with other vessels it deflects it, or turns it off. Darkness wins. Before crossing other boats, some in the opposite direction, others to be overtaken, the spotlight comes on again for a few seconds to warn and visualize the size of the boats.
Next to a deviation from the channel, a diesel pump on the margin waits to replenish fuel those who pass by. The waters carry chips of spherovitis and branches of tree. From when instead, a factory on the banks has its pier benefiting from this privileged transportation road to receive raw material to send production.
The width size of the channel varies and sometimes allows the passage at the same time of four boats, but in other places for three is tight.
We crossed with a track of boats pulled by a tugger, where the workers' cabins are located, taking tinning ten long container boats. A slight tap our boat makes you feel.
If in the first two hours of travel the honk is constant, then it only releases a shrill a whistle sound as it passes a set of houses and when it intersects in reverse with the company's boat.
We fall asleep, but not before feeling another touch between boats and this time the blow is stronger.
We arrived at our destination early in the morning, after more than nine hours of sailing on the Grand Canal. At 5:30, the boat docked next to the Precious Belt Bridge (Baodai Qiao, 宝带桥) in the southeastern part of Suzhou, in Wuzhong district, but we only left at half past six. Two buses wait on Changqiao Street (长桥街道) to take passengers to the city center, six kilometers away.
Baodai qiao is considered one of China's most representative bridges and is named because it was built between 816 and 819 at the expense of selling the valuable belt of Wang Zhongshu, governor of Suzhou in the Tang dynasty. With an extension of 317 meters and 4.1 meters wide, it has 53 arches, with three openings is sufficient to allow the boats to continue through the large channel and also cross the River Daidai and Lake Tantai. The rest of the bridge makes pier, being at the level of the vessels that used and easily discharged the goods.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Death | Died Rocha Vieira at 85</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/obito-morreu-rocha-vieira-aos-85-anos/</link><description>Vasco Rocha Vieira, the last Portuguese governor of Macau, died yesterday at the age of 85. The general had been sick for a long time. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa recalled him as “one of the most illustrious officers” of the army, but to Macau, Rocha Vieira is for history as the great worker of the measures decided in the 1987 joint statement
 
He had been ill for a long time, even missing some recent events in Lisbon about Macau and the transition. Vasco Rocha Vieira, general, former Chief of Staff of the Army, and last Portuguese Governor of Macau, died in the early hours of yesterday at the age of 85.
Born on August 16, 1939, he served as Governor of Macau between 1991 and 1999, when the territory was transferred to China. However, Rocha Vieira already had a connection to Macau, as he was in the territory after the 25th of April. Furthermore, he was also minister of the Republic of the Azores between 1986 and 1991.
One of the first personalities to react to his death in Portugal was the President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who expressed, in a official note, the “deep regret” for the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, recalling him as “one of the more distinguished army officials and praising its “marked patriotism”.
In a note published on the official website of the Presidency of the Republic on the Internet, the head of state recalls Rocha Vieira as "one of the most illustrious officers of the Portuguese army in the transition to democracy and in the first decades of his statement." “Always closely linked to commands, it has also performed political functions such as Minister of the Republic for the Autonomous Region of the Azores,” is remembered in the note.
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa also points out that Rocha Vieira was “very close to President António Ramalho Eanes”, having been “designated chancellor of the old military orders”.
“The symbolism of the moment of transfer from Portuguese to Chinese administration will remain in the memory of many Portuguese as an example of a sense of State, a sense of service to the public cause and marked patriotism”, reads the note of condolence.
The President of the Republic, who claims to have followed “closely the last months” of Rocha Vieira's life, “presents to his family, and, much in particular, to his widow and children, the testimony of gratitude of Portugal, with very longing friendship".
In his biography, entitled “To all the ports I arrived at”, he describes the moment when Mário Soares, then President of the Republic, said to Rocha Vieira: “I need you. Go to Macau and see if you can put that in order”, in reference to the Macau fax case, related to the construction of Macau International Airport, which gave so many headaches to his predecessor, Carlos Melancia, also now deceased.
The general will then replied that nothing demanded to go to Macau. “I didn't ask you anything, nor did I put it in conditions. I went to Macau with the same spirit with which I went to the Azores. It was not a political position inherent in a career. It was, in fact, a mission, ”he describes.
Then it was Rocha Vieira and his team to achieve all objectives and ideal for the future of Macao present in the joint statement that had been signed between Portugal and China in 1987. The government led by Rocha Vieira saw the airport was born, built The entire bilingual legislative framework that is still in place today and raised the Macao Cultural Center, inaugurated by Jorge Sampaio on March 19, 1999, among many other initiatives, including in the area of ​​urbanism.
A "GREAT FRIEND"
Rocha Vieira, in fact, made the position available at the head of the Macau Executive when Jorge Sampaio was elected President of the Republic, at the turn of 1995 to 1996. “When I went to Macau I didn't know how things were going to go and how long it would take. stay there”, he recalled in his biography. However, despite Sampaio's initial hesitation in making a change, the truth is that Rocha Vieira ended up staying, as “his replacement would affect the regular sequence of the process” of transition, at a time when “the transition was already in sight. of the administration of the territory for China”, is described in “To all the Ports I arrived at”.
Speaking to RTP, Chito Rodrigues, a general who was acting governor of Macau, left words of condolence over the death of a friend.
“I remember him as a great friend and honorary partner of the Combatants League. He has always related to us and is our reference. We knew it was bad and we were not, in a way, surprised [with the news of death], but it is always an unpleasant surprise. ”
Chito Rodrigues remembers him during his duties in Macau as someone who contributed “to making Macau a peaceful place so that decolonization could be carried out in an ‘exemplary’ way”. “I was with him at the opening of the airport and had close relations with him as Governor. He was someone who replaced his predecessors with success and humility, restoring the tradition of military Governors in Macau”, he added.
In Fernando Lima and Eduardo Cintra Torres, the former Hong Kong governor, Chris Patten, recalled Rocha Vieira as "a brave and judicious man, with enormous integrity and an excellent server of his country." "I think Portugal was very lucky to have such a good man as the last governor, such a difficult place," he said.
The controversies
Rocha Vieira's name was, however, involved in some controversies, namely with the creation of the Fundação Jorge Álvares and Fundação Oriente, especially regarding the funds allocated to these two entities. “The bulk of public opinion in the territory and the Beijing authorities contested the legitimacy of a contract under which an entity based in Lisbon was fed with resources generated in Macau”, reads Rocha Vieira’s biography. He only intended for the foundation to “play a useful role for Macau”, and the controversy was diluted over time.
On social networks, the journalist and former director of Macau today, João Severino said “mourn a lot” the disappearance of Rocha Vieira. “General Vasco Rocha Vieira left us after several weeks hospitalized at the hospital. Macao's last governor was a good man for many people and discriminatory for many. In any case his military career was exemplary and left marks in the administration of Macao. I kept with the illustrious governor some controversial moments, always within the greatest cordiality and consideration by the maximum representative of my country in Macau. I present to your wife Dr. Leonor and his children my condolences and rest in peace, ”he wrote.
An entity that reacted to Rocha Vieira's disappearance was the Luso-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCILC), which on social media released a note of condolence about the death of the 138th Portuguese Governor of Macau and who presided over the CCILC strategic council.
“General Rocha Vieira played a remarkable and exemplary role throughout his life, standing out for his commitment to service to the nation, his dedication to relations between Portugal and China, and his historic role in closing the administration cycle Portuguese in Macau.”
The same note also states that "in the leadership of the CCILC Strategic Council, his strategic vision, wisdom and human values ​​have always been a source of inspiration for the entire direction and executive team."
Also the Lisbon City Council officially reacted to its disappearance. “Rocha Vieira dedicated her life to the defense of the national interest, notably serving Portugal as the army's head of the army and as the last governor of Macao. Vision statesman assured a peaceful transfer from Macao sovereignty to China. Man of courage, contributed to the consolidation of the democratic process, being a fundamental piece of November 25, 1975. It was an honor to count on his testimony in the first evocation ceremony of November 25 in the Paços do County in 2023. ”
Goodbye to Macau
The images of Rocha Vieira to hold the Portuguese flag to her chest are celebrated on December 19, 1999, with a visibly thrilled face, as well as goodbye to the “mission” he agreed to perform in Macao.
After his role as governor, Rocha Vieira was maintaining narrow ties with the territory, and the last time he was in Macau was in 2023, to receive the distinction of Honoris Causal Doctorate from the Macao University of Science and Technology.
Then he stressed that the "good historical relationships" with China are "a trump card for Portugal" and that today the country is "a superpower in affirmation". The general said that “another great asset” for Portugal is interest in China in the Portuguese language, underlining the growing number of Chinese universities that teach Portuguese. At the end of 2020, the coordinator of the Portuguese Language Pedagogical and Scientific Center of the Macao Polytechnic University, Gaspar Zhang Yunfeng, said there were about 50 higher education institutions with Portuguese courses in mainland China.
“China is interested in that Portuguese develops (…) also to be able to have, through Portugal, a narrower relationship with Portuguese -speaking countries,” said Rocha Vieira.
In a last interview given to the Lusa agency, in 2019, Rocha Vieira recalled the times in Macau and its vicissitudes, especially regarding the transition process.
“I had more problems with the Portuguese side than with the Chinese side (…) many times, due to a lack of perception. Normally, people are far away, in Lisbon – this is a historical thing, which is not just for now – and they think they know the solutions better than those in Macau”, he stated.
Rocha Vieira assured that when it was necessary to define “the course, the fundamental objectives of Macao policies, were discussed by the Macao government in Lisbon, with whom they should be discussed, with the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister”, there is “always” about this “a great understanding on the part of the Portuguese sovereignty organs and a great proof of confidence in those in the territory”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:26:24</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Trump says tariffs are "the only form" in the country being "treated as it should"</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/eua-trump-diz-que-tarifas-sao-a-unica-forma-do-pais-ser-tratado-como-deve/</link><description>European countries will be subject to customs tariffs, "the only form" of the United States "to be treated as they should be," US President Donald Trump said Tuesday.
“The European Union (EU) is very bad for us. They treat us very badly. They do not accept our cars or our agricultural products. In fact, they don’t accept much,” said the President of the United States, adding that, therefore, they will be targets of tariffs.
Asked by the press at the White House, Trump also assured that his administration is discussing “10 percent rates on Chinese products, because they send [the opioid] fentanil to Mexico and Canada”, which is ends up consumed in the states United.
“It’s probably February 1st,” added Donald Trump, the day that corresponds to the date announced the day before for the application of 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian products.
China reacted yesterday, saying it was “firmly determined” to “defend its national interests”.
“We have always believed that there are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war,” declared Mao Ning, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a press conference.
The President of the European Commission (EC), Ursula von der Leyen, who participated in the Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, guaranteed that Europe is ready to talk to the United States government, remembering that Washington is a important commercial partner.
Our first priority is to quickly start conversations about our common interests and be ready to negotiate”, he stated: “We will be pragmatic, but we will remain firm in our principles: defending our interests and respecting our values”, he stated the European leader.
“Europe will continue to defend cooperation, not only with our long-standing friends (…) but also with all countries with which we have common interests”, added von der Leyen.
“Our message to the rest of the world is simple: we are ready to dialogue with you, if this can lead to mutual benefits”, he added, ensuring that he intends to “deepen” relations between Brussels and Beijing.
Nothing new
During his presidential campaign, Trump had already denounced the US commercial deficit of the EU, comparing block to “a small China” and accusing him of taking advantage of the world's first economic power.
“We have a trade deficit with the EU of 350 billion dollars”, he insisted on Tuesday, noting that “China is aggressive, but it is not just China, other countries are also big aggressors”.

Vasco Rocha Vieira, former Army Chief of Staff between 1976 and 1978, died in the early hours of Monday at the age of 85, an official source from that military branch confirmed to Lusa.
“He is an illustrious figure, fundamental in the history of Macau’s transition, but also, to a certain extent, in the present and the future,” said José Sales Marques, president of Leal Senado, the former city council, between 1993 and 1999. “There is a lot something that was done during that period and that continues today. The bases of the Macau Special Administrative Region also have a lot to do with the work of Lieutenant General Rocha Vieira”, argued Sales Marques.
Rocha Vieira held the position of governor of Macau between 1991 and 1999, when the transfer of the territory to China was processed. It was in his mandate that the construction of the city's airport was completed.
The Macau that Rocha Vieira found and left “doesn’t compare. What was done in all those years is something that history has already recorded”, defended Sales Marques. also a member of the then Rocha Vieira Advisory Council.
Former Deputy António NG Kuok Cheong told Lusa that, despite the distrust of the Chinese, the administration "tried to do something to encourage the city's economic growth, which was very poor at that time, before returning Macao."
António Ng, elected to the Legislative Assembly five months after Rocha Vieira's appointment, highlighted that the main obstacle was China's resistance to the liberalization of the gaming sector, which would only end up being launched in 2002.
Something that forced the Portuguese administration to sell land to finance infrastructure projects, inadvertently planting the roots of the housing problem that Macau currently faces, he said.
“They tried to sell the land openly, but the Chinese government stopped them. So most of the land was sold to powerful people in China at a very low price because Macau's economy was very weak,” Ng recalled. A class of landlords was created who, after Macau became the world capital of casinos, became rich by controlling supply and keeping housing prices high, lamented the former deputy.
Work in civil servants
Jorge Fão, one of the founders of the Macau Public Service Workers Association (ATFMP), in 1987, noted that Rocha Vieira “fulfilled his mission as governor” and “dignified his country”.
The former president of ATFPM, heading the association “for more than ten years”, reminded Lusa that he was “a trade union member before being a politician” and “had some disagreements” with the lieutenant general.
Fão explained that it was “one of the protagonists” who worked so that, after the transition from Macau to China, “civil servants [of the Portuguese Administration] were entitled to a pension” paid for Portugal.
“No employees of the other colonies were entitled (…) when we started talking about discussing the delivery of Macau to China, we were very worried. We ended our trade union struggles and had several meetings with the governance of Portugal and Macau (…). We had some meetings and also in these meetings we had mismatches, ”he recalled.
In the end, summarized the current president of the General Assembly of the Association of Retirees, Retirees and Pensioners of Macau, “the outcome was not bad”. “Everyone must be satisfied, I too took part in this fight and have been living on this pension for over 30 years”, he argued.
In the passage of administration, there were about 3,600 retirees with pensions transferred to Portugal, he concluded. In 2022, Jorge Fão told Lusa to believe that about two thousand renovated from the former Portuguese administration of Macau were in the Chinese region.
PS praises life “entirely dedicated to the service of Portugal”
The PS expressed regret for the death of Macao's last Portuguese governor, praising a life “entirely dedicated to the service of Portugal” of a “prestigious military” and one of the “best interpreters of the importance of Macao”.
Through a statement, the party led by Pedro Nuno Santos mourns the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, “prestigious soldier and last Governor of Macau under Portuguese administration”.
“His life was entirely dedicated to the service of Portugal, both in his military career and in his political participation following the 25th of April, as a member of the Council of the Revolution (due to his duties as Chief of Staff of the Army), Minister of the Republic in the Azores, Deputy Secretary of the Government of Macau and Governor of Macau”, states the same note.
Noting that “his life was forever linked to Macau”, for the PS this “was one of the best interpreters of the importance” of that territory “for the relationship between Portugal and the People's Republic of China”, as well as the uniqueness of the now region special administrative.
“The last years of the Portuguese administration of the Territory of Macau, under the leadership of General Rocha Vieira, are marked by the completion of several important public infrastructure works to support the subsequent development of Macau, as well as administrative reforms to prepare it for the subsequent period”, he praises.
Socialists also refer to the ceremony transferring sovereignty from the Territory of Macau to the People's Republic of China, in which the way in which Rocha Vieira “personified and symbolized the dignity and tribute to the Portuguese presence in Macau for centuries” was undeniable.
"And marked the friendship and respect that the Portuguese maintain with Macao and the Popular Republic of China, and which allows, after 25 years of transition, to preserve the uniqueness of Macao that remains a meeting point between cultures," He added.
The PS thus gives "public note of its deep respect for services to the country" and "addresses to your family and your friends your most felt condolences."
Words of Eanes
Already the former President of the Republic Ramalho Eanes classified Rocha Vieira as “a man of exception” and “one of the best” among the greatest figures in Portugal.
"General Rocha Vieira was a man of exception for his excellence action and his assumed social responsibility, deserving to be, precisely, considered" one of the best of our greatest, "wrote António Ramalho Eanes in a note sent to Lusa agency.
The first elected head of state of Portuguese democracy remembers Vasco Rocha Vieira as “an extraordinary man”, especially “on three levels: for his distinctive personality, for his relevant military performance and for the services provided to the country at a political level”.
Personally, Eanes considers that Rocha Vieira, who died today at 85, "had superior qualities", had "exceptional intelligence", "a good temperament" and "had a strong personality."
At a military level, “he was one of the most distinguished soldiers of his generation, providing relevant services to the Army, in difficult times, namely, in the throes of the political regime prior to the 25th of April, during the 25th of April and, even, on the 25th of November, having also played an important role as a representative of the Portuguese Armed Forces within NATO”.
Regarding the political level, Eanes concludes that Rocha Vieira had an activity of “great quality and great importance for the country, both as Minister of the Republic for the Azores, either, as governor of Macao, putting all his commitment to design and execution Successfully, a policy of successful Macao transformation, also participating with the successful success, in the transfer of the administration of the territory of Macao to the Popular Republic of China. ”
Memories of the Azores
The president of the Azorean Parliament, Luís Garcia, also expressed regret for the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, recalling the “exemplary dedication to the public cause” and the “invaluable contribution” to the country and the Azores.
“Throughout his remarkable military and political career, Rocha Vieira has revealed an unshakable sense of state, exemplary dedication to the public cause and a deep patriotism, which indelibly marked the service provided to Portugal,” says Luís Garcia in a note of regret.
The President of the Legislative Assembly of the Autonomous Region of the Azores (Alraa) states that he became aware of the death of the Lieutenant General, a "odd figure and one of the most illustrious officers of the Portuguese army", with "deep dismay."
According to the note, Luís Garcia “expresses his deepest condolences to the bereaved family, leaving a deep testimony of gratitude for their invaluable contribution to the country and the Azores”.
"As Minister of the Republic for the Autonomous Region of the Azores, between 1986 and 1991, Vasco Rocha Vieira performed his duties with high commitment, contributing significantly to the strengthening of institutional relations and the valorization of regional autonomy," he says.
The ALRAA leader also highlights that the period in which Rocha Vieira was at the service of the Azores “is remembered as a time of dedication to dialogue and the building of bridges between the bodies of national sovereignty and the Region's own government bodies”.
“He will also be remembered for the symbolism of his action as the last Governor of Macau, a position he held between 1991 and 1999, when he led the transfer of the Portuguese administration to the Chinese one, in an example of a sense of responsibility and loyalty to public service that will be recorded in the collective memory of Portugal”, he concluded.
Portuguese PM manifests itself
Prime Minister Luís Montenegro today recalled Rocha Vieira as “one of the most brilliant military personnel to body the patriotic sense of being Portuguese”, highlighting his “historical and striking and macau” connection.
Lieutenant General Vasco Rocha Vieira, the last Portuguese governor of Macao and former army general head of the state, died today at dawn at the age of 85, confirmed to the Portuguese official source of that military industry.
“General Vasco Rocha Vieira was one of the brightest military personnel to give body to the patriotic sense of being Portuguese, with special services in the consolidation of our democracy and in the historical and striking connection to Macao, where he was the last governor,” wrote Luís Montenegro, in a publication on the social network X.
The prime minister also presented condolences to family and friends and said he kept Rocha Vieira "gestures of kindness and words of civic and political responsibility."</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Work | East Asia with low work satisfaction and demotivation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/trabalho-asia-oriental-com-baixa-satisfacao-laboral-e-desmotivacao/</link><description>The World Gallup International Association's World Association Report has concluded that in countries and regions of East Asia, such as China, Taiwan or Hong Kong, most workers are looking for a new job. In Hong Kong, only six percent of respondents are committed to their jobs
 
Realizing how workers from around the world feel, and regarding their employment, it is the objective of the Gallup International Association report, entitled “State of the Global Workplace 2024”. If in the worldwide and regional scene, East Asia does well in some indicators, the scenario is not favorable with regard to the commitment or commitment that workers have for the company they are linked to or the functions they perform.
East Asia includes countries and regions such as China, Hong Kong, Japan, Mongolia, South Korea and Taiwan. This area of ​​the globe has “the lowest percentage, at a regional level, of employees who feel daily sadness”, but has “the third highest percentage, at a regional level, of employees who say they are actively looking for a new job.” Furthermore, East Asia has “the third lowest regional percentage of employees committed” to the work they do (18 percent, which still represents an increase of 1 percent compared to the corresponding period between 2022 and 2023) .
Quite the contrary, 67 percent of respondents are not at all committed or committed to work, an increase of five percent compared to the same period. Furthermore, 14 percent say they are completely uncommitted to the company they work for, minus six percent.
As for negative emotions lived daily, and more often, the stress factor leads, with 46 percent response, six percent from the period between 2022 and 2023. percent answers, which did not generate any answers in the last investigation. “Sadness” was a feeling revealed by 12 percent of respondents, 1 more percent compared to the previous inquiry, and “loneliness”, which also has direct entry into this list of less good feelings lived at work, 18 percent.
If dissatisfaction with work is demonstrated in the preceding paragraphs, certainties climb from tone in the category “work environment - good height to find a job”, with 51 percent to respond affirmatively, 11 percent of answers to the previous inquiry . In addition, the category “intention to leave - looking actively for a new work” was chosen for 54 percent of respondents, two percent less from 2022 to 2023.
In the “Life Assessment” category, those who claim to have a prosperous life are 32 percent, seven percent, in contrast to the 62 percent of respondents who claim to be suffering some kind of difficulties, another seven percent in relation to to the last inquiry. The “suffering” category related to the job was chosen for six percent of participants in the inquiry, a direct entry in this study.
Sadness below
For the study of Gallup, 40,428 people were interviewed in 41 countries, and the sample per country contains about 1,000 men and women. The margin of error of the survey “is between +3-5 percent with a confidence level of 95 percent”, is referred to.
The study also compares data recorded by workers in East Asia with other countries. And once again, the lack of commitment and the feeling of “wearing the shirt” that persists in many companies is evident. In global terms, 62 percent of responses point to a lack of commitment, while in East Asia this percentage rises to 67 percent.
Regarding the “life evaluation”, if at the world level 58 percent of respondents says it is having difficulties, the percentage of East Asia is 62 percent. However, suffering meaning is only six percent of the answers, while in the world the bar is eight percent. Regarding this factor, the low percentage of the feeling of “daily sadness”, with 12 percent answers, when the world level rises to the 22 percent.
The feeling of stress is also higher, with 46 percent answers, when at global level is 41 percent.
China: anger and difficulties
Looking at the criteria in each country, 19 percent of workers in China said they are committed to their work, up two percent year on year, while in Hong Kong only six percent of people are committed and enjoy what they do, which which constitutes a one percent drop.
In the “life assessment”, 36 percent of China workers say they are facing difficulties, plus 1 percent, while in Taiwan 41 percent says they face less good times, representing a direct entry into the classification, with no previous score to compare. In the case of Hong Kong, 17 percent of respondents assume to cross difficulties, plus 1 percent compared to the previous inquiry.
As for the feeling of “daily stress”, China rises to the first place in the ranking with 53 percent answers, yet 2 percent in annual terms, with Hong Kong following the footsteps, with 49 percent answers . Japan is third with 41 percent people to feel stress daily.
In response to the question if it felt angry the day before, China leads again with 18 percent answers, despite the annual breakdown of 2 percent; Following South Korea, with 17 percent affirmative answers, and then Hong Kong with 16 percent. In China only 12 percent of workers said they felt sadness, thus putting the country in third place. In relation to Hong Kong there were 11 percent affirmative responses in this domain.
Jon Clinfton, CEO of Gallup, warns about the increase in mental health problems around the world, especially related to the workplace and relationships in business. Around 20 percent of workers around the world “experience daily loneliness”, and this feeling “is greater among workers who are fully teleworking”.
“In this year’s report, 41 percent of workers say they feel ‘a lot of stress’. However, stress varies significantly depending on the way organizations are managed. Those who work in companies with bad management practices (actively unmotivated) are almost 60 percent more likely to be stressed than people who work in environments with good management practices (committed). In fact, the experience of ‘a lot of stress’ is reported about 30 percent more often by employees working under poor management than by the unemployed,” said the Gallup CEO.
For him, “leaders know that stress in the workplace is a problem – they have seen the data, listened to colleagues and felt it themselves”. “A quarter of leaders feel burned out often or always, and two-thirds feel it at least sometimes. Many are trying to solve the problem, but often ineffectively”, he concludes.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:41:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Toponymy | Study links streets with Portuguese names to colonialism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/toponimia-estudo-relaciona-ruas-com-nomes-lusos-com-colonialismo/</link><description>In the master's dissertation “Sino-Portuguese Culture in Macau-History on the Streets”, Zhao Zhen argues that the Portuguese administration diluted “the national identity” of the Chinese population, by putting names with reference to Portugal on the streets, namely writers, navigators, governors and civil servants
 
Zhao Zhen, author of the master's dissertation “Sino-Portuguese Culture in Macao-Street History and Sino-Portuguese Culture from the perspective of the names of the streets of Macau)”, argues that the choice of street names with reference to Portugal during Portugal The years of the Portuguese administration was an effective form of colonization and the creation of the feeling of belonging to the colonizing nation, especially with regard to the Chinese community.
In the dissertation, defended at the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro (UTAD), it is concluded that “before the return of Macau to China the Portuguese government carried out a political and cultural practice through the attribution of street names to Portuguese way ”.
Thus, the names of streets in Macau served “as a means of transmitting a collective memory, starting with the construction of the image of the Portuguese Government in Macau and the orientation of its main values”, using “iconic historical figures and events to reinforce the identification of the colonized with their colonizing identity”.
Zhao Zhen further added that “during the 400 years of colonization of Macau by the Portuguese State, linguistic symbols were applied to the inhabitants of Macau through the naming of streets, diluting the traditional national identity of the Chinese and implanting that of the colonizers, thus achieving the objective of remodeling the national identity of local inhabitants”.
For the author of the study, the issue of the territory's very particular toponymy had consequences with regard to national identity. “The street names in Macau are different from those in other Chinese cities, and this has had an impact on the cultural identity of the local population, who grew up with Chinese and Portuguese history and culture and who do not have a strong sense of cultural identity. It thus dilutes its mission of transmitting its national culture.”
A form of domain
It is true that Zhao Zhen's academic work, in the area of ​​Cultural Sciences, draws attention to the fact that Macau's toponymy is a reflection of a mixture of cultures. However, the author goes further, analyzing how many streets there are in Portuguese and Chinese named after important personalities, highlighting the fact that Portuguese culture is dominant.
The fact that there are streets in Macau named after Portuguese soldiers, former governors or politicians, such as Mário Soares, Sidónio Pais or Ramalho Eanes, is seen as synonymous with the fact that the Portuguese invested in “an effective process” of transmitting “a materialized vision of the world that influences and transmits social relations between people and different social classes”. Thus, what occurred was “an act that does not use violence as a form of forced control of the minds and conscience of the population”, in which “a means of coercion” was not applied.
Zhao Zhen states that “in total there are 26 streets named after Portuguese government officials in Macau who distinguished themselves for the contribution they made to the city, with no street named after a Chinese official in Macau”.
This shows “the distinction made by the Portuguese colonizers as a dominant class and the Chinese as a dominated class”, it is stated. However, the author emphasizes that “the Portuguese colonization of Macau was not an absolute aggression or domination”, as “the colonizers attempted to achieve leadership from a variety of perspectives, including ideological”, in which “the process of achieving this leadership it was interspersed with a more complex racial and cultural gray existence.”
According to the author, “the first systematic delimitation of streets and the establishment of names by the Portuguese government of Macao was in 1869”, and were used enough names with connection to the discoveries and the former Portuguese empire.
Zhao Zhen gives the example of Rua de João de Almeida, which “is named after a general who stood out in campaigns to assert colonial power in Angola, Africa, at the beginning of the 20th century”.
In total, there are 26 streets with references to the discoveries and former Portuguese navigators, showing that “the colonial administration [Portuguese] used external political forces to indoctrinate the inhabitants of Macao with the intention of achieving leadership, guiding society through manipulation spiritual, moral and cultural ”. In addition, the author considers that it was used "a colonial vocabulary to create a sense of identity and subordination among the inhabitants, in order to achieve permanent colonization."
Highlight is the existence of nine streets in Macau named after Macanese, such as Rua Francisco H. Fernandes, who was born in the territory on February 13, 1863, son of Portuguese parents, and who was a close friend of Sun Yat -sen, father of the Republican Revolution in China, in 1911.
The place of the Chinese
The same dissertation reads that, in contrast to the primacy of references to Portuguese culture and history, there are only 12 streets in Macau “named after Chinese”, the majority of which “were merchants from the peninsula and all had connections with the Portuguese government in the region”. In turn, “Dr. Sun Yat-sen Avenue is the only street named after a Chinese political figure”.
Citing another academic, nicknamed Kuan, Zhao Zhen states that "in the case of names with names of Chinese celebrities, besides being inferior in number, they were non -political figures." "The Portuguese government of Macao, when it baptized the public roads, was intentionally into account political factors, wanting to convey the message that Macau was under Portuguese rule and that, politically speaking, was a Portuguese colony," said this same academic.
Highlights include two streets named after Macau's return to China, namely Avenida Doutor Henry Fok and Avenida Doutor Ma Man Kei. “These personalities were distinguished by their notable contributions to the reunification of Hong Kong and Macau and to the development of China, so the attribution of the name of the street to these personalities reflects the influence of political factors after the end of Macau's long colonial history and smooth reunification with China. The addition of the word ‘doctor’ to their names shows even more respect for them”, it reads.
Also noteworthy is the existence of 140 streets in Macau whose names are translated phonetically from Chinese, highlighting Avenida de Ip Heng, Avenida de Lok Koi, Pátio de Iong Loc, Pátio Fu Van or Rua de San Lei. “All these words Chinese women express the people's desire for a better life and the search for quality of life. Other names are related to Chinese religion, such as Largo de Pao Cong Mio, Rua de Kun Iam Tong”, it is mentioned, without forgetting the 69 streets with names paraphrased in Chinese with connection to Chinese beliefs.
“In order to live a better life and move it in the expected direction, the naming of streets reflects geographic elements, as well as people's hopes for their future lives. Street names are mentioned and used so often that people tend to give them good meanings to satisfy their own intentions of a better life. Influenced by traditional Chinese cultural concepts, many of the street names in Macau have auspicious and lucky meanings, with the words ‘Harmony, Tranquility, Friendship, Benevolence, Concord'.”
There are also streets whose names "show traders' desire to have a prosperous business and to get all the profits that come from business."
In general terms, Zhao Zhen concludes that “Macau's experience proves the possibility of harmonious coexistence of various communities and cultures”, and the toponymy “reflects the coexistence and mix of the East and the West, the harmony and difference between them, which Today is a mirror of culture and fundamental values ​​of society. ”</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:56:42</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Trump takes office and throws barbs to China on Panama Canal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/eua-trump-toma-posse-e-lanca-farpas-a-china-sobre-canal-do-panama/</link><description>The new US President Donald Trump promised Monday to take control of the Panama Canal, renamed the Gulf of Mexico and reinforce the taxation of foreign countries, confirming intentions already expressed for the second term in the White House.
In his speech at the inauguration ceremony as the 47th President of the United States, Donald Trump highlighted that the objective of the agreement and the spirit of the treaty in relation to the Panama Canal “have been completely violated”, promising to take control of this vital maritime infrastructure for global trade.
“And most importantly, China operates the Panama Canal, and we didn't give it to China, we gave Panama. And let's take it back, ”he justified in his speech held at the Capitol (headquarters of the US Congress) in Washington.
In another intention already expressed, Trump also confirmed that soon he will change the name of Mexico's Gulf to “Gulf of America”.
More taxes
Upon his return to the White House (North American presidency), after a first term between 2017 and 2021, the Republican politician also stated that he intends to reinforce taxation in foreign countries in favor of North American citizens.
“I will immediately begin reforming our trade system to protect American families and workers. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will impose tariffs and taxes on foreign countries to enrich our citizens”, he declared.
Expel illegals
Donald Trump also guaranteed that he will expel “millions and millions” of illegal immigrants, one of the main focuses of his election campaign. “First, I will declare a state of emergency on our southern border” with Mexico, said the President, adding that he will send the Army to patrol that region.
"All illegal entrances will be immediately blocked and we will begin the process of return millions and millions of criminals where they came," added the Republican President.
The oath of the new North American leader was taken shortly after the inauguration of his future vice president, JD Vance, with whom he led the nomination of the Republican Party, which, on November 5, 2024, won the presidential elections against the candidate Democrat led by Kamala Harris.

The non-governmental organization suggests measures that promote equality and warns of the risks of concentration of wealth and power
 
It’s called “Takers not Makers – The unjust poverty and unearned wealth of colonialism” and is the most recent report from Oxfam, a non-governmental organization (NGO). ) which brings together 19 countries. The document draws attention to poverty in the world and inequalities in the distribution of wealth.
The report released yesterday concludes that inequality gives no signs of slowing down. This is because, last year, the combined wealth of global multimillionaires increased two billion dollars, equivalent to $ 5.7 billion a day, according to Oxfam.
This means that it grew at a pace three times higher than the previous year, according to the NGO.
This was the main conclusion of the report released yesterday at the beginning of the Davos World Economic Forum, which each year brings together the world's leading political and economic leaders in the Alpina city.
In the last year alone, the report reports, an average of almost four new multimillionaires a week came, as Oxfam puts in contrast to the World Bank poverty data, which estimates that the number of people living with less than 6.85 Dollars a day has almost not changed since 1990.
In 2024, there were 2,769 billionaires around the world, instead of 2,565 in the previous year, and their combined wealth increased from 13 to 15 billion dollars in just 12 months. It is the second largest increase in the combined wealth of billionaires in a single year on record.
Another 100 million
The joint wealth of the ten richest men in the world increased, on average, almost $ 100 million a day, the study indicates. Even if they lost 99 percent of their richness overnight, "they would remain multimillionaires."
The NGO predicts that, in less than a decade, the first “billionaire” on the planet will emerge and does not exclude the possibility of there being at least five. At a global level, the report reveals that 36 percent of the wealth of the richest is inherited and 61 percent is also marked by clientelism and/or linked to monopoly power.
Oxfam is based on Forbes magazine's 'wealth ranking' data, which show that all multimillionaires under 30 inherited their wealth and, according to Swiss bank UBS data, in the next 20 to 30 years, a thousand dos Current multimillionaires will leave their heirs more than $ 5.2 billion.
Southern Money
For Oxfam, the system “causes large flows of money to move from the global South to the North, benefiting the richest population”, in a kind of “modern colonialism”.
In 2023 alone, through the Financial System, $ 30 million will be removed per hour from the global southern countries to the richest 1 percent of the global northern countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States and France.
In this way, the “super-rich” from the countries of the global North control 69 percent of the world's wealth, concentrate 77 percent of the combined wealth of all billionaires and represent around 68 percent of the total, although they constitute only 21 percent of world population.To contextualize this inequality, Oxfam refers to the housing problem in Spain and estimates that “the five future billionaires on the planet will have so much money that they will be able to buy all the houses in the country”.
In contrast, attention is drawn to the fact that the “working class fights to survive.” "Those who live in poverty around the world continue to face multiple crises, as pandemic scars are still with us in the form of priceless debt, lower salaries, and much higher food prices."
Furthermore, “conflicts are also on the rise, which contributes to poverty, hunger and inequality”, without forgetting “the enormous human impact of climate degradation that increases every year, with deaths caused by excessive heat, extreme weather conditions and hunger".
Oxfam even says that Donald Trump's re-election as President of the United States last November “gave a huge boost to billionaires' fortunes, while his policies are poised to further fan the flames of inequality”.
The NGO also highlights the World Bank data in its latest poverty report, where it is said that "if the current growth rates remain and inequality does not decrease, it will take more than a century to end poverty." The document shows that "if we reduce inequality, poverty could be eliminated three times faster."
One of the highlights goes to the contribution of women to the wealth of the few. “Racialized women living in poverty, especially those in the 'global south', continue to subsidize the global economy. It is estimated that every day women contribute 12.5 billion of unpaid work hours, adding at least 10.8 trilions of dollars in the global economy. ” In this context, “the economic contribution of its care work is three times higher than the financial value of the world technological industry”.
A new colonialism
It is true that the decolonization of regions colonized by European powers began to occur with greater force after the Bandung Conference in 1955, but signs of power imbalance between people and countries persist, which explain, in part, the wealth inequality that occurs. today.
The idea of ​​a new colonialism, in the sense that regions such as Europe or North America continue to exploit countries in the South, especially the less developed ones, is clearly evident in the Oxfam report. “The rise of a new oligarchy in which inheritance, clientelism and monopoly power generate extreme wealth. Without control, we are about to see the greatest transfer of the greatest generational wealth in the history of humanity, hardly earned, difficult to tax.”
What is happening today is a panorama of “billionaire colonialism”, describes Oxfam, with “the transfer of wealth not only to the ultra-rich, but disproportionately to the ultra-rich in the Global North”. There is a “reckoning with colonialism not only as a history of brutal wealth extraction, but also as a powerful force driving extreme levels of inequality today.”
Oxfam also draws attention to a new wave of colonialism evidence in the actions of the major economic and financial institutions that decide the direction of the global economy, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank. "Global institutions, financial markets, and multinational companies, all shaped by colonialism and mastery of rich countries, continue to facilitate the south-north transfer of dollar trillion every year."
For Oxfam, the UN, IMF and World Bank “were created 80 years ago, close to the end of the historical colonial period, and their unequal governance has changed little since then”.
“The G7 countries continue to hold 41 percent of the votes at the IMF and World Bank, despite having less than ten percent of the world's population. The leaders of the World Bank and IMF continue to be decided by the United States and Europe, respectively. Likewise, European countries and other nations in the Global North hold 47 percent of the total seats on the UN Security Council, despite representing only 17 percent of the world's population.”
It should be noted that "the IMF and the World Bank continue to have a huge influence on the global economic system and, in particular, on the economic policies of low and medium-low countries." These entities, according to Oxfam, "systematically insist on the implementation of cuts in critical expenses."
One of the examples presented is from the IMF, which "requires debtor countries to prioritize the payment of debts to creditors above all and implement policies that include privatization, liberalization of trade and reduction of public deficits to obtain new loans." "These policies impair access to quality education and affordable prices and health care, with a negative impact on public health," he adds.
What to do?
Oxfam proposes a series of measures to mitigate the growing inequality between the richest and the rest of the planet, suggesting, among others, that Governments commit to ensuring that the income of the richest ten percent of the population does not exceed that of the 40 percent poorest, both nationally and globally.
The report also establishes an increase in taxes on large fortunes, through an international tax system designed by the UN, and the elimination of tax havens.

The Parliament of Portugal unanimously approved a vote of regret of the Assembly of the Republic by the death of General Rocha Vieira, former governor of Macau, considered a relevant personality in the construction of Portuguese democracy.
Minister of the Republic in the Azores between 1986 and 1991, governor of Macao between 1991 and 1999, during the period of the transfer of sovereignty of this territory to China, General Vasco Rocha Vieira, born in Lagoa, died on Wednesday at the age of 85.
In the vote subscribed by José Pedro Aguiar-Branco, it refers that Rocha Vieira performed functions as head of the army state between 1976 and 1978 and integrated, in care, the Council of Revolution, being a “decisive figure of political life and Portuguese military ”.

This news will be created by the public hiring proposal, approved in general on January 11 last year.
According to the explanations of Ella Lei, president of the commission, the possibility of so-called “competitive negotiation” with candidates is a new feature of the law, but can only be used in three situations: when all public tender proposals are rejected, although without changing substantially the tender specifications, when the work is too complex, making it impossible to establish a previous price for the proposals, or when the nature of the work makes it impossible to fix a price in advance.
According to the newspaper or Mun, the law proposal states that when the administration chooses to avoid the public tender, and calls for proposals to a certain number of companies, the consultation must be made at least five companies. However, Ella Law indicated that the deputies are concerned that the alleged “randomness” of the companies consulted is not guaranteed or result in a fair procedure, so this will be discussed with the executive.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:49:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Press | Sam Hou Fai stresses diversity and internationalization</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/imprensa-sam-hou-fai-frisa-diversidade-e-internacionalizacao/</link><description>The message was left by the Chief Executive during the dinner offered to the media in Portuguese and English.

In a speech before the Portuguese consul and the delegates of the Macau Forum, Sam Hou Fai stressed the importance of the guidelines proposed by Xi Jinping during the visit to Macau
 
Macau and Portuguese-speaking countries must strengthen business cooperation. This was one of the main highlights of the Chief Executive's speech at the reception dinner for the consuls general in the Macao SAR and the delegates from Portuguese-speaking countries at Forum Macau.
Sam Hou Fai called for the improvement of “various exchange and cooperation mechanisms” between Macau and Portuguese-speaking markets, to “comprehensively leverage exchange and cooperation at the private sector level”.

The Continental Council of Affairs (MAC) of Taiwan recalled that the travel alert to both territories remains at the “orange level”, the second highest level.
The body responsible for relations with China justifies the warning “taking into account changes to the situation in Hong Kong and Macau and in response to local laws and regulations and law enforcement methods”. “Citizens are advised to avoid non-essential travel” to the two cities, including in transit, due to “possible risks to safety and individual rights”, added the MAC, in a statement.
The Lunar New Year is the main party of Chinese families, equivalent to Christmas in Western countries, and this year in Taiwan includes a period of nine days of holidays between January 25 and February 2.
MAC advised the population in advance in a database created for Taiwanese inland, Hong Kong or Macao and recalled that there are direct telephone lines to support citizens.
Registers to rise
Although not mandatory, the number of Taiwanese who registered to travel to Chinese territory between January and October 2024 increased by around 14 times compared to the previous year, according to data released by the organization in December.
Registrations for Hong Kong and Macau “exceeded five times the total for the same period last year”, said the MAC.
China "continued to adopt and change national security laws, which led to several incidents, involving arbitrary detention, arrest and interrogation of Taiwanese citizens in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao," said the body.
In September, MAC said that a director of the Taiwanese conglomerate Formosa Plastics had been under “border control” for 18 days, a type of measure that prevents him from leaving the country.
Taiwan raised its travel alert level in mid-June and advised the population to avoid China, Hong Kong and Macau, after Beijing threatened to execute people considered “staunch defenders” of Taiwanese independence.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Watch out for the bags</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/cuidado-com-as-malas/</link><description>“Olha a mala…” was a song by fado singer Celeste Rodrigues. It became immensely popular. I remembered the song because last week suitcases were the main topic in the media. We all have a suitcase. Most people who travel by plane have a hold bag where they put their most varied belongings. We usually put clothes, shoes, hygiene products and souvenirs for family and friends inside. There are many women who, not realizing the risk, put some of their valuable jewelry in their travel bags. There are people who risk carrying amounts of money wrapped in silver paper. And there is drug trafficking in many of the hold suitcases under the most diverse disguises. The travel bag is essential as something very intimate and that accompanies us. Often the suitcase does not reach its destination and we have to wait several days for it to appear and there are also cases where some of the suitcases are never seen again. Airlines are obliged, in these cases, to compensate passengers who are left without bags. However, the products that belonged to us and that we really liked we never see again. This happens all over the world and almost every day in the most different airports.
The suitcase in the airport carpet is completely identified by itself, due to its color and even the accessory linked to the handle with our name and our phone.
By the way, I remembered a text by writer Yvette Vieira, who said: “I recently read news about an English tourist who threw herself to the sea on Madeira Island, allegedly to go after a cruise ship where she would be The husband, the wife was rescued from the sea waters by three young people who decided to go to fishing that same night and one of the details that caught my attention throughout this Rocambolesque story was that the lady in question was able to maintain the surface in cold waters of the Atlantic, thanks to its suitcase. And that last fact did not surprise me, because it is under what circumstances is a woman never drops her suitcase. Which leads me to the theme I want to explore, women and their bags. In this world there are two types of portfolios, those who use large bags and women who prefer small sizes.
I belong to the first group, because my whole life is concentrated in my suitcase. I'm that type of woman who, in an emergency, can pull out of her suitcase, as if it were a magician's hat, all kinds of things, from band-aids, ointments, writing paper, water, pills for a headache, etc, etc. , think about anything and that object is probably in the contents of my suitcase. Furthermore, I have a friend who had among her personal belongings a screwdriver that had been forgotten in her suitcase and had been with her for almost a year. And I'm not kidding! Not to mention the moms' bags, which are veritable warehouses of paraphernalia that would leave your jaw dropping. But why does a woman feel the need to have everything in her wallet? I don't know. I would like to have a logical explanation for such almost insane behavior, which involves kilos of belongings transported daily with long-term consequences for our bone structure, in my case I can only say that I don't like being caught off guard.”
For the case is really, not being caught off guard. We don't run out of a suitcase where we are like that we like very much and that we are particularly disliked if we lose them. It turned out that the news fell like a bomb about the theft allegedly practiced by a party deputy arrives. The same party that does not stop talking about crime and that criminals must all be arrested. For, the Azorian deputy of the arrival was under the eye of the authorities since November last year, due to an anonymous complaint, that he stole bags that did not belong to him from the rugs of the airports of Lisbon and Ponta Delgada. Authorities this time confirmed through video-vigilance images that the deputy took bags that allegedly did not belong to him. Searches were searched for their Lisbon and Azores homes, resulting in suspicion of even stealing bags from other passengers. It sounds like a caricature case, but it is not. According to the television commentator and lawyer Rogério Alves, if proving the robbery of suitcases will be a serious crime that can go to a sentence of eight years in prison. However, the deputy concerned Miguel Arruda, after being removed from arrival, shamefully decided to continue in Parliament as an unregistered deputy.
Just imagine your suitcase disappearing from the plane hold. The loss of your belongings, the consequent heartbreak and even the damage caused by a mental flaw of someone who got used to carrying other people's bags and enjoying all the good things that those bags would have inside. Now, the act being carried out by a deputy of the Assembly of the Republic is something that not even the devil would have imagined possible. The final investigations and the latest judicial decision on the alleged luggage thefts by the Chega deputy are awaited. The most important thing is that fellow readers be careful with your bags…
 
P.S. - Kung Hei Fat Choi</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Which path to follow?</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/que-caminho-seguir/</link><description>At the end of last year, during the visit to Macau, to chair the inauguration of the new Chief Executive and to inspect Rae, President XI Jinping gave two speeches, highlighting the "three expectations" and the "four hopes" to Macao's future development.
This month, several meetings were held to analyze the President's speeches, the most significant being the thematic seminar that took place in Beijing on the 9th, where Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Labor Office of the Committee Central of the Communist Party of China and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office at the State Council, delivered important messages. But regardless of the activities and seminars held, the key to improving Macau's development is the action of the SAR Government.
Although the integration of Macao and Hengqin is the goal to reach in the next 25 years, the Macao Peninsula, Taipa and Coloane are currently the areas under the direct jurisdiction of Rae de Macao. Hengqin, being an area for “improving the new trading, construction and joint management system and sharing results” between Guangdong and Macau, remains a cooperation zone in China that aims to facilitate the economic diversification of Macao to its official integration in the MSAR . In late October 2024, more than 16,000 Macao residents lived in the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macao in Hengqin, but the vast majority still live in Macao.
As the “Macao Consumer Grand Prix” ended in December last year, there were continued calls from residents for the resumption of the Electronic Consumption Benefits Plan to compensate for the rising cost of living.
However, local stores, affected by increased consumption of residents in mainland China and the increase in rents of rentals, seek way to try to survive. Although tourists from the interior of China arrive in groups, and do young visitors flood the tourist attractions to take photos, what tangible benefits bring to small and medium -sized local companies? In addition to increasing close contact between residents and compatriots of China in public transport, which other economic benefits come from these tourists?
The expectations and hopes for Macau of the national leader, President Xi, are genuine. If Macau performs well, it could become an exemplary model of the “One Country, Two Systems” principle, valuing the city and allowing it to stand out. As for the “three expectations” and “four hopes” highlighted by President Xi, I have a personal opinion.
Macao, is a bridge that connects today Chinese culture and western culture and has established its position in the national development framework as "a center, a platform and a base." To contribute to the construction of the Great Bay, Macau's main task should be the safeguarding of its characteristics. Only this way can you have the opportunity to make a difference in the international scene. Being patriot and loving Macau are certainly the basic requirements for Macau recruit trained people. Those who grew up in the city would not want to see their resources exhausted.
However, ideas vary from person to person, but as long as they do not endanger Macau's interests or pose a danger to the country, they should be seen as patriotic. There are sayings like “greatness comes from an open mind”, “he who listens to all parties gets a clear view of the situation” and “only when every drop of water is retained can a river be formed and from the confluence of rivers an ocean ”.
In the Chinese classic “I Ching”, you can read “just as celestial bodies never lose energy while describing their orbits, we must also fight constantly for our improvement”, which means that nothing in the world is unchanging. To drive Macau towards the future, we need capable individuals and entrepreneurs.
As for the adequate diversification of Macau's economy, the Guangdong-Macao In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin will undoubtedly be an excellent platform. In Macau's current economic structure, with the diversification of “1 + 4” industries, the gaming sector plays a crucial role. In the future, it will be more important to redouble efforts to achieve the progressive development of other sectors, rather than reducing the scale of operations in the gaming sector in order to achieve adequate diversification of Macau's economy.
With regard to improving the level of governance, it is essential to avoid “nepotism”, expand the “circles of friends” of the government team and encourage and support public monitoring of the Government's performance, so that there is efficient and effective governance.
The reforms are the previous condition for opening and opening is the result of the reforms. Taking advantage of Macao's experience on internationalization allows the Government of Masters to help transform the great bay into a “open platform”. If the Government of the MSAR can protect the way of life of citizens they will not naturally have reasons for complaints. If the Government of the MSAR ensures employment, society will not fall into chaos. A fair and equitable society will certainly be peaceful!</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:28:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Geogastronomy and Macau UNESCO Creative City in Gastronomy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/a-geogastronomia-e-macau-cidade-criativa-em-gastronomia-da-unesco/</link><description>“Geogostronomy Offers an Innovative Lens Through The Exploration of the Deep-Rooted Cultural Connections Between Food, Landscape and People. The Synergy of the Mix and Match From Different Areas Creates A Magical Creativity to Outstand the Taste of Memories Which Seated as the Greatest Piece of a Region. As part of the UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy in Macao, Lisbon Macau Aim to Bring Together the Tradition and Innovation of Food and Fun Places to Foster the Global Appreciation of Macao. ”
Dr. Christine Hong Barbosa.
Vice President of Marketing &amp; Retail Development of Lisbon
Geogastronomy is a term that merges geography and gastronomy, emphasizing the relationship between food culture and its geographic roots. This concept highlights how local ingredients, cooking methods and cultural influences converge to shape regional cuisines. By examining local cuisine, researchers and enthusiasts can gain insight into a community's history, culture and identity. Geogastronomy thus serves as a bridge that connects culinary practices to environmental and sociopolitical contexts.
Macao, located on the southern coast of China, is a distinct example of geogostronomy in action. Its position as a Historical Trade Port and Culture Cauldron provides a unique scenario for its culinary evolution. The intricate mix of Portuguese and Chinese influences in Macanese cuisine shows how geography can influence food culture, leading to a diversified range of flavors, ingredients and cooking techniques. Macau's gastronomic scene is a vibrant tapestry woven from various cultural wires, particularly those of Chinese and Portuguese origin. The city has iconic dishes such as the Macaense curry, cod and the authentic cream pastels (which are not confused with the eggs that ask for the streets and that we will reveal how such a phenomenon), each reflecting its influences arose. unique historicals.
The fusion of spices, aromatic herbs and cooking styles creates a distinct gastronomic identity. The use of seasonal and locally sourced ingredients highlights Macau's connection to its geographic environment, reinforcing the principles of geogastronomy. The historical context of Macau's gastronomy is remarkable. Portuguese colonization introduced new ingredients and culinary techniques that became part of Chinese food traditions. This cultural exchange resulted in a rich variety of dishes that combine the best of both worlds. For example, the use of cumin, curry powder and coconut milk reflects Portuguese culinary practices, while techniques such as wok frying signify traditional Chinese cooking methods.
As a result, Macau cuisine has developed into a sophisticated blend, rather than being a mere amalgam of the cultures that influence it. Several influential personalities play a crucial role in shaping Macau's culinary scene. Notable chefs and restaurateurs have dedicated their efforts to preserving and innovating Macanese cuisine. Renowned Chefs António Neves Coelho and José Avillez are known for modernizing traditional Portuguese dishes while maintaining their authenticity. His approach serves as an example of how chefs can honor their culinary heritage while adapting to contemporary trends. They emphasize the use of local ingredients and the appreciation of traditional recipes. Through their initiatives, they promote the concept of geogastronomy as a method to preserve culinary heritage.
Their work exemplifies the vital role that chefs and culinary professionals play within the creative city. The designation of “Macau as a UNESCO Creative City in Gastronomy” in 2017 further highlights the importance of culinary innovation and heritage. This recognition emphasizes the city's commitment to maintaining and promoting its rich culinary history while promoting a sustainable future. The program encourages collaboration between local chefs, artisans and academics, promoting a gastronomic culture that reflects Macau's mixed identity. The designation of “Macau as a UNESCO Creative City in Gastronomy” had a far-reaching impact on several facets of Macanese society, namely tourism and local economies, which slowed down during the Covid-19 pandemic and are beginning to revive.
Lisboeta Macau, for example, has made a notable contribution with its official vision being “to be a themed Macau tourist destination that combines iconic landmarks from its collective memory with unique Sino-Portuguese culture to promote its unique cultural identity . Lisboeta Macau proudly aligns with the vision of Macau as a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy. Macau's rich cultural history, which combines Portuguese and Chinese influences, creates a unique and dynamic gastronomic landscape. Lisbonite Macau believes that this recognition as a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy not only celebrates the fusion of flavors and traditions, but also highlights the importance of preserving and innovating local food heritage. With a strong commitment to preserving Macanese heritage and promoting innovative culinary experiences, Lisboeta Macau takes advantage of the company's strengths to promote Macanese-Portuguese culture, supporting cross-border integration “Turismo+Gastronomia” through collaboration with the famous Chef Portuguese António Coelho at “Angela's Café and Lounge”, highlighting the fusion of Macau's Portuguese-Chinese heritage with traditional Portuguese cuisine, combining culinary techniques Portuguese classics with innovative creations to offer citizens and visitors a memorable gastronomic experience and contributing to Macau's growing reputation as a vibrant gastronomic hub, in line with its economic development, attracting food enthusiasts, tourists and industry professionals”.
“Lisboeta Macau is committed to supporting the Macao SAR Government's strategy of promoting the tourism industry, consistently driving local economic growth through innovation and cross-border integration. Lisbon Macau's LINE FRIENDS themed restaurant “BROWN &amp; FRIENDS CAFE &amp; BISTRO” and Shanghai's famous crab brand “CEJERDARY” joined the 24th Macau Gastronomic Festival, introducing diverse local flavors to global tourists and highlighting the Macau's dynamic strengths as a vibrant platform as a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy. Furthermore, Lisboeta Macau intends to take advantage of the synergies of the “Macao Outdoor Show Space” to present the “LISBOETA NIGHT-the Night Market with More Macanese”, stimulating the economic development of the community and immersing visitors in a distinct mix of traditional culture and modern innovation, showing the essence of Macanese and Portuguese-inspired culture, further strengthening Macau's night-time economy. These collaborations help reinforce Macau’s position as a creative city that values ​​both culinary tradition and innovation, ensuring the long-term sustainability of its gastronomic scene, while promoting economic growth and cultural exchange.”
Such a distinction, he positioned Macau as a global gastronomic destination, attracting gastronomy enthusiasts and tourists eager for experiencing his unique culinary offers. The tourism sector benefited significantly with this designation. With the increase in international interest in the gastronomy of Macao, several festivals and gastronomic events were organized to present local dishes. These events not only celebrate gastronomic culture, but also offer entrepreneurs and platform companies to show their products. This increase in tourism translates into an increase in economic opportunities for local inhabitants, including the creation of employment in the sectors of hospitality, restoration and homemade food production or almost, weigh the crisis that Macau lives with the low purchasing power of residents that It decreased to the detriment of the continent and the tourist from there that it has reduced equally for the same reasons.
In addition, UNESCO's designation leads the government to sponsor initiatives designed to support sustainable practices in the gastronomy sector. Programs that encourage cuisine without waste demonstrate a commitment to sustainability and community involvement. This paradigm change reflects a growing awareness of the interconnections between gastronomy, environmental management and social responsibility. Culinary education is another critical aspect of Macau's gastronomic narrative. Teaching institutions and cooking schools that should be created urgently not only reserved for the University of Tourism will play a key role in the formation of the next generation of bosses and cooking professionals. As they integrate the traditional Macanese cuisine in their curricula, these institutions foster the appreciation of the local gastronomic culture among students.
This educational approach also encourages innovation, as young chefs experiment with their heritage, breathing new life into traditional recipes. Cultural preservation is fundamental to maintaining Macau's rich culinary history. Initiatives aimed at documenting traditional recipes and cooking techniques through oral histories and publications ensure these culinary traditions are safeguarded for future generations. The role of grassroots organizations and community projects focused on culinary heritage reflects the collaborative spirit of geogastronomy, in which local communities actively engage in preserving their unique food cultures.
Despite the positive impacts of its designation by UNESCO, Macau's gastronomic sector faces challenges that deserve attention. A significant concern is the potential dilution of traditional practices due to globalization and mass tourism. With the proliferation of international restaurants and fast food chains, there is a risk that local culinary traditions are overshadowed, leading to a loss of cultural identity. In addition, Covid-19 pandemic had a serious impact on the sectors of hotel and tourism. Travel and restoration restrictions have forced many local companies to adapt quickly or risk closing.
Although some establishments have adopted innovative approaches, such as delivery services and virtual cooking classes, others have struggled to survive in a difficult economic scenario. Another challenge lies in the balance between modernization and culinary authenticity. As heads experience melting kitchens and modern kitchen techniques, concerns may arise regarding the integrity of traditional dishes. Finding a balance between innovation and preservation will be essential to maintain the authenticity of Macanese cuisine. Looking to the future, several developments may emerge in the macao gastronomy sector. One of the predictable trends is the growing emphasis on sustainable practices.
As consumers become increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their eating choices, Macao's restaurants and the likes can give priority to local and organic supply. This change promotes a sense of community and responsibility to the environment. In addition, technology is likely to remodel the culinary landscape. Advances in food production, preservation and distribution can provide growth and innovation opportunities. For example, using digital platforms can improve marketing efforts and reinforce connections between consumers and local producers. Innovations such as vertical agriculture and aquaponia can also offer sustainable solutions to supply ingredients in a densely populated city.
Collaboration between culinary professionals, tourism authorities and the governments of Macau and Mainland provinces will play a crucial role in shaping the evolution of Macau's gastronomic identity. Joint initiatives aimed at promoting food culture, organizing workshops and showcasing local ingredients can raise the profile of Macanese cuisine on the global stage. These collaborative efforts promote community engagement and can mitigate the risks posed by globalization and the pandemic. The future of Macau's gastronomy looks promising, with a growing emphasis on sustainability and innovation. The collaborative spirit of geogastronomy can guide the city in navigating these challenges, ensuring that its rich culinary heritage endures as it adapts to a changing world.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:52:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Dom Dinis's face</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/o-rosto-de-dom-dinis/</link><description>It was now seven hundred years ago on the seventh of January that the most emblematic king of a country absent of features and forms passed away, which in aesthetic and anatomical terms we cannot consider anything emblematically representative, or even dream of the physical form of certain many other representatives, but with him , it happened. We saw him like a Janus reborn in time (however, leaving behind what could have been his young face) and it was with some emotion that we looked at him, and this will not be erased from the collective memory, which was never alien to his charm. .
Dom Dinis is a bit like legends and having a face fills us with excitement and strange enthusiasm, that, on the exact day of his serious hour, we had it. The region that crowned him is full of those faces, that Atlantic coast of Pinhal and Coastal is emblematic in physiognomic opinion, and these things are aspects to add to the very impact of the moment- he came from a bruh that Avalon's might still complain- they would still complain- and had the undeniable serenity of a poet.
A monarch may be, or not, serene, from a political, state perspective, therefore, but in him we feel something else that does not come in the maps of the references of his own status. Legend has it that it was red, but what came to us was that thirteenth -century being who had died at sixty -three, an age considered of great longevity for the time, which his buried body did not represent as clear the other man who It was, and it was the possible image taken from his sepulcher from Odivelas that came to us as a strange appearance that has silenced us and forced us to a feeling Vénia.
His blue eyes, who say they had greenish reflexes, his forgotten white hair, was what remained and dazzled us: and if we retracted his grandfather Afonso x the wise man, we will seek the same subtle characteristics they made of grandfather and grandson the harp where even today our hearts are aligning. The songs of Santa Maria must also have these blue eyes, which Aragon in his funeral insignia was still his grave, and all this makes us, of course, quite thoughtful. He was the sixth Portuguese king, and never the corners can exercise such order in the demand of his numerical. Perhaps it had been our David star without the recent aspects that define it, when yet, and lovingly, called "his Jews". He also called the Moors, Templars, and all those who fit in his heart.
Let us address Him with the intact respect of seven hundred years, that our matrix does not stop in the roses, nor are our dreams freer than the profound nature of its meaning of mission, where he fulfilled and was Lord, loving for all The lands of his kingdom the women who inspired him: where a Afonso Sanches, a bastard son who followed the footsteps of a father who cultivated his tongue and first imposed it as an official language, followed. Then he had a grandson named Pedro to whom he had been gone at birth with gold coins and other recitals so that his voice was clear as a monarch, but the boy would later be very Gago, a lover of his grandfather, and The most beautiful prince in the world.
His excremental son, Afonso IV, had battles with tears and some blood, but Dom Dinis did not run away from battles as a man of his time, and his nature must have suffered from the rudeness and blows of these things. He was born on October 9, 1261, was acclaimed king in 1279, and died in 1325 on this January 7, so full of bad memories. We must read it to know how to sing, know the green, smell the pine trees, and know how to build new boats. He also had a truculent profile, a large nose and a tender and tenacious countenance. But the spark that symbolizes beings no science yet knows how to reproduce, identify, and demonstrate as a pragmatic domain.

The recovery of real estate and consumer confidence levels in Mainland China will be determining factors
 
Casino revenues could grow by up to 7 percent in the Lunar Year of the Snake, depending on the recovery of real estate and Chinese confidence, but will be far from the pre-pandemic peak, analysts told Lusa.
“The biggest positive factor for Macau would be if the Chinese economy grew and consumer confidence levels improved,” said Vitaly Umansky, analyst at the consultancy firm Seaport Research Partners.
More than 70 percent of the people who visited the territory in 2024 came from mainland China, whose economic growth reached in 2024 the goal of 5 percent fixed by Beijing.
But Nicholas Chen, an analyst at CreditSights, said the group company of financial rating agency Fitch expects a slowdown to 4.7 percent this year, in part due to weak private consumption.
The consumer confidence index in China fell to the lowest level in the last 34 years in September, highlighted Jeffrey Kiang, an analyst at consultancy CLSA. In other words, “if the outlook for Chinese consumers is not good, they may tighten their belts, reduce travel and consumption”, including in Macau, explained Nicholas Chen.
 
Stimulus Policies
The Chinese Communist Party has launched a series of stimulus measures, including the reduction of interest rates and mandatory bank reserves and the anticipation of thousands of millions of its budget in 2025 to fund construction projects.
Beijing also expanded a consumer goods exchange system and raised the salaries of millions of public servants to revive domestic demand. “The [Chinese] Government has already said that it will launch more measures to stimulate the economy”, said Vitaly Umansky, who hopes above all for a recovery in confidence among the middle class: “I think it will happen, it’s just a matter of time”.
Creditsights expects Chinese consumer confidence to rise in the second half of 2025, along with real estate price stabilization, which have been falling for 19 consecutive months.
The issue concerns a lot of Beijing, due to the implications for social stability, since housing is one of the main investment vehicles of families and the real estate sector - adding indirect factors - represents about 30 percent of the Chinese economy.
“There will certainly be some side effects, because part of the measures that are adopted to boost domestic consumption could flow to the Macau gaming sector”, said Nicholas Chen.
The analyst believes that China will also expand the list of cities whose residents can apply for 'individual visas' to visit Hong Kong and Macau, a method used by 35.2 percent of tourists who passed through Macau in 2024.
 
Different views
Vitaly Umansky has no opinion and recalls that since January 1 residents of the neighboring city of Zhuhai can visit Macau once a week and stay up to seven days.
On the other hand, analysts agree that casino revenues will be far from the historical maximum of 303 billion patacas recorded in 2018 next year.
"One thing is clear: the government aims to moderately growth in revenues in the future," said Jeffrey Kiang, recalling authorities predict gaming revenues of 240 billion in 2025, which would be a 5.8 percent increase. .
“When the Macau Government publishes a forecast, it is usually very conservative and is based on prior discussion with the Liaison Office” of the Chinese Central Government in the city, said Vitaly Umansky.
The analyst does not believe that Beijing has some measure to control the resuming of casinos, similar to the campaign that began with the arrest of the leader of the world's largest VIP betting company in November 2021.
The former executive director of Suncity, Alvin Chau Cheok Wa, was sentenced in January 2023 to 18 years in prison for illicit gambling and secret society exploitation, in a case that saw the number of licenses for gambling promoters drop from 85 to 18, known as 'junkets'. “Much of the reprehensible behavior in Macau disappeared with the junkets. As long as things like that don't happen again, I don't expect any kind of campaign in the short term,” said Umansky.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Traffic | Lawyer calls for an end to “moral judgments” with images</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/transito-advogado-apela-ao-fim-de-julgamentos-morais-com-imagens/</link><description>The causal Luís Ho Ka considers that the use of traffic chambers can lead to cases in court, and that the images captured must be sent to the authorities, rather than shared on social networks
 
Lawyer Luís Ho Ka Hou defends the use of surveillance cameras in traffic by drivers, but calls on the Government to take measures to avoid using the images for “moral judgments”. The lawyer's opinion was shared with the newspaper Ou Mun, following an incident in front of the Portuguese School of Macau, in which images of a lawyer of Portuguese nationality were shared.
Heard by the newspaper Ou Mun, the lawyer considered that recording videos by cameras installed in vehicles can be important, particularly when there are accidents and the need to activate car insurance. However, Ho Ka Hou highlighted that vehicle cameras cannot be turned into a mobile surveillance system used to make “moral judgments” on social media.
Ho also explained that the images captured by the vehicles must be handed over to the authorities, instead of being published online, and that those responsible for the recording must only send them to the authorities, following the legal procedures provided. If the images are of public interest, they can be used. However, if the use of images goes beyond the scope of the authorities' process and investigations, as happens with publications on social networks, and if there are elements that can be considered insulting or defamatory, then the person responsible for capturing and disseminating them may face criminal liability.
 
Legal problems
Luís Ho Ka Hou also indicated that, according to the judicial perspective, the appropriate use of recorded images in traffic is captured the accidents, to hold it and cooperate with the authorities, in case it is necessary to collect evidence.
If there is no consent of the recorded people, and if the content is published on social networks for moral judgments, then we are facing cases that are hardly under the appropriate recording, which may lead to violation of the law of personal data protection or other image rights.
Ho Ka Hou also warned that “judgments” on social media could cause damage to the rights to privacy and good name of the parties involved.
About two weeks ago a driver was captured in traffic, after passing a red light, parking in a forbidden place and making an obscene gesture with children. The images, which allowed the driver to identify, were shared online, which held a campaign against the visa, including with dismissal requests from the employer, as well as several hate comments with xenophobic expressions.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 10:51:34</pubDate></item><item><title>STD | Dismantled six illegal pensions in 12 days</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/dst-desmanteladas-seis-pensoes-ilegais-em-12-dias/</link><description>The Tourism Services Directorate (DST) set up an operation to combat illegal guesthouses, between the 1st and 12th of January, in preparation for the Lunar New Year holidays, in which six guesthouses that were operating illegally were dismantled. .

In 2024, authorities collected almost 190 million patacas in fines, an increase of 9.12 percent, despite infractions only rising 0.4 percent
 
More road accidents, more patacas in fines and less dead in road accidents. This can summarize 2024, according to the statistical data released by the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP).
Last year, the roads and streets of Macau totaled 15,510 car accidents, a total that represented an annual rise of 14.36 percent compared to 2023. Still, 2024 was less deadly on the territory roads, with five fatalities (all related to drivers) against eight deaths recorded in 2023, ie a decrease of 37.5 percent.
However, the number of injuries increased by almost 13 percent to a total of 5,341, climb driven by the increase of light injuries in a year when the wounds that needed hospitalization fell almost 50 percent.
Still in the accident rate chapter, the highlight is the increase in accidents involving pedestrians, with an annual increase of 6.7 percent to a total of 510 occurrences.
Economic diversification
The year 2024 was also a period in which the value of fines added almost 16 million patacas compared to the previous year. Last year, the total value of fines was almost 189.8 million patacas, an increase of 9.12 percent compared to the same period last year. Despite the increase in the amount collected by the authorities, violations of the road traffic law and the highway code remained practically the same level, with a slight increase of 0.4 percent to 703.8 thousand occurrences.
In terms of fines, parking continued to dominate, with 618,260 fines, the vast majority for illegal parking on public roads. Even so, parking fines decreased by 2.38 percent compared to 2023. However, the number of blocked vehicles increased by 24.5 percent in 2024, to a total of 2,226.
At the opposite pole, CPSP's 2024 data reveal the return of a classic, with the climb almost 48 percent of taxi drivers' irregularities for a total of 870 cases.
Regarding drivers caught driving under the influence of alcohol, the authorities accounted for 170 drunk people, an annual climb of almost 7 percent. Of these 170 people, 155 were male.
One of the statistics that has increased in recent times in terms of fines is pedestrians who cross the road without complying with traffic rules. Last year, authorities fined 7,460 pedestrians, a total that represented an increase of 58.5 percent.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:59:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, leaves us with his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: high There, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife. — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unambiguous moral implication in the phrase “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is managed to seek a reason for Things abroad to us in the other. It is an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this error. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicidou -If and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ that had not entered the story. »
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment by Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at having been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature to Thomas Traströmer, a complete unknown. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the choir of those waiting for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of it, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “I never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but that just brings me the comfort of knowing that the world isn't a soap opera where everyone know and the joy of recognizing that the yardstick of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I also preferred that in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have been awarded. Les années ”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Award had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her novel “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Coast.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timothy should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but to be highlighted simply that we "we do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the depths of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our dilated pupils of astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that can satisfy your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and imposing, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and we soon feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unrestrained by reins and containment.
Men should refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the fields will perish as a result. cultivated, for it the tame animals will be beheaded, for it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the pride of countries will be destroyed.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert».
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that gag, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in relationships were limited. human beings, or if it simply lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, which is then declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but a also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people, who always seems the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters At eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Evidently, they are the two 'Bigger Than Life', but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my rank of hatter at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, in a different way, with his heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

Helahoho! helahoho!

The High employee corruption investigation office (CIO) has announced that it has transferred the case to the prosecutor, which has the power to formally accuse a South Korean head of state.
The CIO considers that Yoon conspired with the then Minister of National Defense, Kim Yong-hyun, and other military officers to start a mutiny, declaring martial law on the night of December 3rd. It further argues that Yoon abused his power by sending troops to the National Assembly (parliament) to prevent deputies from revoking martial law.
The Public Prosecution Service now has 11 days to decide whether or not to start the requested process. If Yoon is considered guilty of leading an insurrection, a crime for which a president has no immunity in the country, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment or the death penalty.
Yoon is in custody at the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, south of Seoul, since January 15. The Constitutional Court is simultaneously made a judgment to determine whether or not to ratify the dismissal approved by parliamentarians on December 14.
If the highest court in South Korea confirms the impeachment, early presidential elections have to be called within 60 days after the court decision. Yoon refuses to witness in the investigation into the alleged crime of rebellion.
Yoon Suk-Youol surprised the country on December 3 by declaring martial law, a measure reminiscent of black days of the South Korean military dictatorship and that justified with the intention of protecting the country from “North Korean Communist forces” and “Eliminate elements hostile to the state”.
Pressured by the deputies and thousands of protesters, Yoon was forced to revoke the decision hours later.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:30:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Afghanistan | Beijing calls for severe punishment for authors of the murder of Chinese citizen</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/afeganistao-pequim-pede-punicao-severa-para-autores-do-assassinio-de-cidadao-chines/</link><description>China yesterday appealed to the Afghan authorities to do an "exhaustive investigation" and "severely punish" those responsible for the murder on Wednesday of a Chinese citizen who worked on a gold mine in Takhar's Afghan province.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a press conference yesterday that Beijing is “deeply shocked” by the attack. “China is against all forms of terrorism”, stressed the spokesperson, calling for “the repression of the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations listed by the UN Security Council”.
"China will continue to pay close attention to the security situation in Afghanistan and to support Afghan authorities in combating all forms of terrorist violence and maintaining security and stability in the country," Mao added, urging the Afghan government to Take the necessary measures "to ensure the safety of citizens and Chinese organizations in the country."
According to local police, the victim worked in a gold mine in the region, which borders Tajiquistan. A local branch of the Islamic State Islamic Group claimed the authorship of the attack. China is one of the few international actors that has maintained diplomatic relations with Afghanistan since the Taliban reached power in August 2021.
The two countries share a small international border of just 76 kilometers in the easternmost part of the so-called Wajan Corridor, a remote pass in the Pamir mountain range.
Chinese companies, with the support of Beijing, have sought to take advantage of opportunities to explore the vast deposits of non -developed resources from Afghanistan, especially Mes Aynak Mine, which is believed to contain the largest copper deposit in the world.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:18:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Commerce | Beijing says tariffs do not benefit China, US or the world</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/comercio-pequim-diz-que-taxas-nao-beneficiam-china-eua-ou-o-mundo/</link><description>The Chinese Ministry of Trade said yesterday that the United States imposition of customs of Chinese goods “would not benefit China, the United States or the world,” in the face of the threats of US leader Donald Trump.
The ministry's spokesman, He Yadong, said at a press conference that his country “has always maintained a consistent position” on increasing rates. “China is willing to work with the US to put economic and trade relations between the two countries in a stable, healthy and sustainable direction,” he said.
Asked whether his ministry has already communicated with the new US administration's commercial team, He said that China “always maintains contact with the competent authorities” in the United States.
Chinese diplomats assured on Wednesday that “there are no winners in a trade war”, after Trump said he was considering imposing 10 percent duties on Chinese imports in retaliation for the flow of fentanyl.
“We're talking about a 10 percent rate based on the fact that they're shipping fentanyl to Mexico and Canada,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.
The Republican leader said that he spoke “the other day” with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and that he told him that he did not want that “crap” in the country. Last year, around 70,000 deaths were recorded in the United States due to the consumption of that synthetic opioid.
Trump team members included China on Monday, along with Canada and Mexico, among countries whose US commercial relationship would be revised by the Republican, which launched a trade war against the Asian nation during its first term.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:17:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing orders funds to buy more shares to boost markets</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/pequim-ordena-fundos-a-comprar-mais-accoes-para-dinamizar-mercados/</link><description>The Chinese Government announced yesterday that it will order pension and investment funds to buy more shares in Chinese companies, aiming to stimulate the country's financial markets, after years of stagnation.
Officials said that starting this year, mutual funds must increase their holdings in domestic shares, called A shares, by at least 10 percent per year for the next three years.
Commercial insurance funds will have to invest 30 percent of their new annual awards in the actions of action starting this year, they added.
"This means that at least several hundred thousand long -term yuan millions of yuan will be added [to the shareholder market] every year," said Wu Qing, chairman of China's Securities Regulatory Committee.
“The implementation of the various measures of the plan will further increase the capital's capital funds' capital affectation capacity, constantly expand the scale of investment, improve the supply and structure of funds in the capital market and consolidate the good conditions to The recovery of the capital market, ”he explained.
The Chinese Communist Party announced this measure just before the biggest holiday of the year in China, the Lunar New Year, which begins on Wednesday, January 29. It is a time when families tend to increase spending on meals, travel and cash gifts for adult children and young people.
Hong Kong and Shanghai markets climbed after the announcement, with the Shanghai Index composite initially winning about 1.5 percent, although in the middle of the session it was rising 0.8 percent. Hang Seng Kong's Hang Seng Index lost its first gains and remained virtually unchanged.
Chinese stock markets reached their peak value before the Asian financial crisis and have since remained well below that level. The lack of appreciation in stock prices, together with falling property prices, has diminished investor confidence, raising deflationary risks in the world's second largest economy.
Advances and Reforms
To date, Chinese government efforts to make people spend more and save less have been mitigating success. An initiative to promote the purchase of energetically efficient vehicles and appliances through the payment of subsidies to consumers who deliver old versions of these articles increased sales. But action prices stopped after a brief recovery at the end of last year.
Wu said that pension funds will be forced to overhaul the way they evaluate their performance and that companies will be encouraged to carry out more share buybacks and pay higher dividends to provide shareholders with better returns.
“This is a very important institutional advance for the entry of medium and long term funds in the market. It can be said that it solves a problem that has been solved for many years, ”he added.
"Sales of the main shareholders and the high market volatility have impaired Chinese financial squares," said Law Meng, Chinese action analyst at UBS Securities, in a comment widespread yesterday.
“The desire of long-term investors to participate in the stock market has decreased,” he added. “The proposal to reform market value management directly addresses this issue, because it is directly related to investors’ sense of gain”, he highlighted.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:15:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | Beijing and Brasilia highlight “growing consensus” to find political solution</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/ucrania-pequim-e-brasilia-destacam-consenso-crescente-para-encontrar-solucao-politica/</link><description>The two nations continue to make efforts to find a solution that puts an end to the conflict in Ukraine.

Chinese diplomacy chief Wang Yi yesterday highlighted the “growing consensus of all parts to promote a political solution” for the war in Ukraine during a telephone conversation with Brazilian special counselor Celso Amorim.
In 2024 Wang and Amorim advanced with a joint proposal to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. "The goal is to gather the consensus of the" global south "and create and accumulate conditions for peace conversations," said Wang Yi yesterday, according to a statement issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
Wang stated that China and Brazil have “similar development trajectories and highly complementary economies” and that the “strong mutual trust and friendship established between the heads of state of the two countries have laid a solid political foundation for both to carry out cooperation comprehensive”.
“China firmly supports the leadership of the Brazilian President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, so that the Brazilian people explore a path of development, in accordance with their national conditions”, added the minister, while at the same time conveying his “support ” to the South American country during its current presidency of the BRICS bloc of emerging countries.
Wang also expressed his hope to “work with Brazil to defend genuine multilateralism”.
Amorim called for efforts to “build a community of common destiny between Brazil and China for a fairer world and a more sustainable planet”. “Brazil and China, as emerging powers, can further strengthen cooperation and play a greater role in maintaining world peace and combating climate change,” stated the special advisor to the Brazilian Presidency.

Sunac, once one of China's largest property developers, became the first company in the sector to successfully restructure its debt issued in domestic markets (“onshore”), after gaining support from creditors.
In a statement sent to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where it is quoted, the company stated that the creditors of these obligations, which was missing about 15.4 billion Yuan, approved the plan presented by the company.
The proposal envisaged a reduction to less than half of this amount and offered several options, such as extending the maturity of the bonds until 2034, without the obligation to start paying them until 2029.
Sunac had already been a pioneer among Chinese prosecutors when, in October 2023, it obtained approval from the Hong Kong court for the agreement it had reached with creditors to restructure around US$10.2 billion of debt issued on the markets. international (“offshore”).
Debt rating agency Standard&amp;Poor's (S&amp;P) stated at the time that Sunac would pave the way for restructuring the offshore debt of other Chinese developers in similar situations, as it not only sought to prolong obligations to save time, but also included instruments such as debt swaps.
However, on March 10, the state asset manager Cinda filed a settlement against the company in Hong Kong for non -payment of a $ 30 million loan. The first hearing was scheduled for March 19.
This case is distinguished from similar ones, such as those who also face in hong Kong giants such as Evergrande or Country Garden, because the complainant is a Chinese state company and not a private creditor, although Beijing has repeatedly promised measures to stabilize The real estate market in recent months.

The prosecutor's actions in Hong Kong fell more than 25 percent following this news. Yesterday, despite the agreement with the 'ONShore' creditors, they fell 2.41 percent during the morning of the session.
Sunac had total liabilities of about 896 billion yuan at the end of the first half of 2024, during which it recorded a net loss of 14.957 billion yuan.
The financial situation of many Chinese real estate companies worsened after Beijing was announced in August 2020 restrictions on access to bank financing for prosecutors who had accumulated a high level of debt, including Evergrande, with a liability of almost 330,000 million dollars.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:53:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Afghanistan | Talibans claim that Chinese citizen was killed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/afeganistao-talibas-afirmam-que-cidadao-chines-foi-morto/</link><description>A Chinese citizen was killed in northeastern Afghanistan, announced yesterday a Taliban police spokesman, although the murder of foreigners was rare in the country, especially since the removal of US troops in 2021.

Francisco Leandro, associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Macau, says that the nation's support has allowed the Macao SAR to serve as a center for trade, investment and cultural interactions between China and Portuguese-speaking communities.
 
 
How do you see Macau developing since your return to your homeland? Among the city's achievements, which ones impressed you the most? What about your sector, has there been any important progress in the last 25 years?
The 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the Motherland and the creation of the Macau Special Administrative Region constitutes a significant milestone in the region's history, reflecting a successful diplomatic process and demonstrating its current political and economic stability. Currently, the Macau SAR enjoys political stability and is deeply integrated into national development plans. The city's governance under the “one country, two systems” principle allowed it to maintain a high degree of autonomy while aligning with national policies. This integration has facilitated Macau's economic growth, making it a vital part of the country's broader economic strategy.
Macao's socioeconomic development strategy is consecrated in the policy “a center, a platform, a base”. This picture aims to position MSA as a world center of tourism and leisure, reinforcing its attraction as a global tourist destination. In addition, MSAR acts as a platform for economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, promoting international trade and cultural exchange. Rae de Macao is also becoming a base of exchange and cultural cooperation, promoting cultural interactions and the conservation of heritage. This multifaceted approach supports Macao's integration into national development plans and reinforces its global presence. The unique position of MSA as a bridge between China, in particular the great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay, and Portuguese-speaking countries underline their strategic importance.
The concept of “one platform, three centers” highlights Macau’s role in promoting economic and cultural exchange. This platform allowed the city to serve as a platform for trade, investment and cultural interactions, strengthening ties between China and the Portuguese-speaking world.
Macau's development as a tourism and leisure center, along with the promotion of four main industries - conventions and exhibitions, cultural and creative industries, traditional Chinese medicine and modern financial services - diversified its economy. These initiatives not only boosted economic activity, but also reinforced the global attraction of Macau as a tourist destination.
The central government has adopted a series of policies for Macau. Is there any specific measure that has benefited your sector? As?
The interior of China and the Macao Economic Economic Partnership Agreement (Cepa) play a crucial role in the great bay and in the promotion of ties with Portuguese -speaking countries. By promoting commercial and economic cooperation, the strain reinforces the position of MSA as a bridge between China and Lusophone countries. This agreement facilitates access to the market, investment and cultural exchange, promoting Macao as an international business center. In addition, the strain supports the integration of Macau in the Great Bay area, contributing to regional development and economic diversification. This strategic role underlines the importance of Macau in the broader economic and diplomatic initiatives in the country.
The promotion of higher education in the Macau SAR also played a crucial role in its development. By investing in education and research, Macau contributed to national development objectives and positioned itself as a center of academic excellence. This investment in education allowed the creation of a qualified workforce, essential to sustain economic growth and innovation. The University of Macau is highly regarded in global academic rankings. It was ranked 180th in the World University Rankings 2025 by Times Higher Education, and 245th in the QS World University Rankings 2025. Furthermore, the University of Macau is ranked 262nd in the Best Global Universities by US News &amp; World Report. These rankings reflect the university's commitment to excellence in teaching and research, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence, engineering and social sciences. The university's strong international collaboration and innovative research contribute significantly to its esteemed global position.
This year marks the third anniversary of the establishment of the Guangdong-Macao In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin. In your opinion, how should Macau continue to take advantage of the area's advantages to develop itself and the education sector?
The Hengqin Cooperation Zone is one of the main objectives of Macau's modernization efforts. This zone has been instrumental in boosting innovation and economic diversification, providing a space for new industries and promoting closer integration with the continent. The area exemplifies Macau's commitment to modernization and its strategic role in regional development.
Macao is a unique mix of Chinese and Portuguese cultures. In your opinion, how can this merger help the nation to reinforce communication with the international community and tell the good stories of China?
Macau is a fascinating mix of cultures, where East meets West in a unique and harmonious way. Its linguistic landscape is a testament to its multicultural heritage. Chinese is the official language and the Portuguese language can be used for official purposes, reflecting Macau's historical ties with Portugal and its Chinese roots. English is also widely spoken, especially in business and tourism, making Macau a truly multilingual society.
The legal system of MSAR is another domain in which this cultural mixture is evident. Based on the Portuguese Civil Law System, it was adapted to the local context under the “one country, two systems” principle. This double legal system allows a unique mix of Chinese and Western legal traditions, ensuring that Macau's legal environment is familiar to its residents and accessible to international companies.
Macau's approach to extrajudicial resolution of commercial disputes further highlights its multicultural policy. The city offers various arbitration and mediation services that serve both local and international parties, promoting efficient and amicable dispute resolution. Macau's open city policy and multicultural attitude are key to its success as a global hub. The city welcomes people from all over the world, promoting a diverse and inclusive community. This openness is reflected in its festivals, its gastronomy and its daily life, where different cultures coexist and enrich each other. Essentially, Macau's mix of languages, legal systems and multicultural attitudes makes it a unique and dynamic place that builds bridges between cultures and promotes global connections.
What achievements would you like to see by Macau in the next 25 years?
In short, Macau's future is bright, with greater integration with mainland China, its central role in international trade, diversified economic growth and a strong global presence. These elements will ensure Macau’s continued success and development on the world stage. The 25th anniversary of Macau's return to its homeland celebrates not only a successful diplomatic achievement, but also the region's ongoing contributions to national and global development. Macau's strategic initiatives and its integration into national plans highlight its importance as a dynamic and future-oriented region.</description><pubDate>2024-12-16 02:20:12</pubDate></item><item><title>António Antunes, cartoonist: “Sometimes I consider myself an artist”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/12/antonio-antunes-cartoonista-as-vezes-considero-me-um-artista/</link><description>His name is António Antunes, but he signs his cartoons simply as António. For 50 years he has characterized current affairs using drawing and humor, much of it at Expresso. In an interview, the cartoonist, who drew the times after the 25th of April, regrets that today young cartoonists do not have as many opportunities to make a career
This 50 -year adventure is already long dedicated to Cartoon. Have you ever thought you were going to do this for so many years?
No. Things were happening, and the result is this. There were not even perspectives to have a plan. Portugal has not been a country that greatly favors this type of activities.
He did training at António Arroio school during the Estado Novo period. What was it like to learn arts at a time when the country [Portugal] was so gray, with limits to creativity?
We mainly learned techniques, work or composition. Now creativity is something else. Not only was she very limited, but it's not something to sell either. There are no courses to take artists, there are courses that give us notions about painting composition or techniques, or colors. But that alone is not enough. Then there needs to be anything beyond what is academic. In the arts there is always anything that escapes even if you learn everything. Creativity is a strange thing because there is no rule.
Does António consider himself an artist?
(Hesitates) Sometimes I consider it.
He has had many controversial cartoons, namely Pope John Paul II with the condom in his nose. What were the cartoons that forced you to make the biggest waist play or deal with more pressures?
Maybe it's my happiness, but my problems are never a priori, but rather a posteriori. Until now I have not been very limited in what I can do at the [Expresso] newspaper. Now, when things come out, sometimes they have consequences. In Portugal it was the issue of condoms for the Pope, internationally it was other things. This cartoon continues to move.
What was it like to deal with all this controversy?
This cartoon [Pope John Paul II] was controversial because they wanted to be so. That went very well and did not generate any ranks. Then there was a conservative movement within the church that wanted to make it a controversy, three weeks began to excite that, to make a petition. The man who led the Catholic forces said he expected a million signatures, but fortunately he got only 29,000, and the difference made the mountain not a mouse Parisse. It was even discussed at the Assembly [of the Republic]. It is a controversy a lot of little, even more, 30 years later, when the church itself is changing its point of view on this matter, namely with this Pope [Francis], fortunately. In the face of what led me to do this cartoon, I did it again. The Pope's statements at the time were public, they were not even hidden, inside walls, and spoke to the whole world, so also to me. I felt injured, that it made no sense. I think the Pope's attitude at that moment was criminal at the Pico da Aida and in Africa. It was of huge insensitivity and foolishness.
Is Cartoon a throwing weapon, a form of expression?
Throwing a weapon is too harsh an expression, but the cartoon is, in fact, the way I express myself. There are colleagues of mine who make articles, but I make drawings.
What other cartoons highlights, for what they brought you?
The first one that sensitized me was the one who made me win the world's largest salon in the world [major prize of the XX Salon International of Cartoon, Montreal, 1983], from this corner that is Portugal. A hall that had over a thousand participants, and gaining it was very good. I was safer, confident, because from then on they could continue to do things. This first cartoon also gave controversy, the “Warsaw Ghetto in Shatila”, in which I use the known photograph of the ghetto, a Jewish kid raised, harassed by Nazi soldiers, and in the cartoon the kid is Palestinian and Israeli soldiers. [The controversy was] with all the voices of the Jews, who are experts in this, making a lot of noise, with a certain tone of victimization, even if they are attacking. A hall director said he tried to change the vote, such is the weight of Jewish lobby, but failed.
This cartoon could be drawn again today.
I already published it again. Unfortunately it is not out of date.
But do you feel that much of what you drew about current affairs is repeated, a sign that History is cyclical?
There is a resistance to change. One of the merits of the cartoonist is to be able to see ahead of time, or over time if you want. I have the invasion of Crimea made in 2014, and I assume that vision. It was above, and others did it later. There are other examples.
It begins to do cartoon after April 25, 1974, there a little there in the aftermath of the revolution. Do you feel that, in a way, has inaugurated the discipline of the Political Cartoon in Portugal?
Perhaps. But I'm not very clear about it, because before me there was a great designer, João Abel Manta, a fantastic chart, which had a huge difference from us, because we were kids and he already had a culture that allowed him that. But there is a less good side, because he did political propaganda. He was a man of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), and made this advertisement to where the revolution allowed it. Then when things stabilized, he went out and went to do other things. This does not remove the quality, but it is not my notion of Cartoon. I respond to the various stimuli of events otherwise. Cartoon allows me to express opinions, but be able to do so in different meanings of life, perspectives, without being a prisoner, as he became a prisoner of the PCP, was something that helped me a lot.
Have you ever felt any pressure from the newspapers where you contributed?
(Hesitates). Some things, but they are not important. One thing I managed, without much effort, was to make people think that I had a really bad temper, and that it was better not to mess with me. This helped, because they thought twice before talking to me. Once at Expresso, a sports guy ordered a cover from me, and started giving me tips on how I should draw it. Until I asked him if I had ever told him how to write a news story. This must have remained in his memory for many years, and this conversation must have resonated with other people. I didn't go to Expresso, I was always in my own corner and didn't get worn out by day-to-day life, by friendships and enmities.
Do you usually draw here, in the studio?
Here. But that [the ill-tempered image] actually helped me. And there is also the story of me having another profession. I usually say that I really had two professions, as I was a cartoonist and a graphic designer, and then I had clients of mine who were also from Expresso, namely A Tabaqueira. I was a friend of the commercial director, a self-indulgent type, who got me involved in negotiating contracts with the newspaper on behalf of A Tabaqueira. Therefore, I conveyed an effective image of power that, in reality, I did not have. If you combine a guy who has a bad temper with a guy who apparently has power, it's a bummer (laughs).
When I ask him about the pressures, I think of the period right after the 25th of April, 1974-1975, when everything was politicized. Were they bigger then?
I managed to deal with it. During this period of PREC (Revolutionary Process in Progress) there was even a cartoon about PREC that lasted two years. It was a kind of forward flight. There was a lot of confusion, and, I think, this was of interest to my newspaper [Expresso], although this was never said. It gave an idea of ​​the newspaper's freshness in relation to a complex period, but I was never told that. I have the idea of ​​the cartoon's usefulness, it was a way of consolidating the newspaper's independence in relation to events, even when sometimes there was no such independence.
Are we today in an era of political correctness, where everything seems to offend?
I don't feel, because I don't want to feel. I came to a phase of my life where if they didn't want to put up with me, they don't work. It's easy. Everything that was a struggle to impose a name and a point of view, a career, has already been made. It can be improved and consolidated, but if not, it is not. If I become very inconvenient for the newspaper where I work, and I want to believe this does not happen…
But in general terms, to the news, comments on social networks, do you feel that there is the politically correct?
Of course there is. My situation is of exception. The younger ones in the world of Cartoon have no opportunities at all. They have less than when I started. For various chances of life I have a position that has solidified, but this is not exemplary to what goes on. The new cartonists are full of trouble, there is no room for them, there is no means of payment. They are pushed to get out of the newspapers, not to enter.
Doesn't Cartoon have no place on social networks?
(Hesitates) It may appear, but it doesn't seem to me… Journalism is said to die and we cartoonists are going first. I think this is the trend. Journalism has been losing power in the face of social networks, with an anonymous opinion, which cannot be scrutinated, is very bad and mediocre. And that will grow.
What about Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Can replace the cartoonist.
I'm not even talking about this because I don't know the limits, but I understand that they must be terrible. It can indeed replace the cartoonist, but then creativity is subverted.
Is there any public figure who particularly likes to portray in Cartoon?
The other day I said that, in relation to Trump, I had two antagonistic feelings: as a citizen, I find the man detestable; but as a cartoonist it is my raw material. Putin is good too. All men with lots of narratives and lots of power are likely to give good things from the point of view of a cartoonist's analysis. They are politicians with a very clear speech about what they want and what they want, and that could be good for the cartoon.
How do you feel to go to Macau again?
The exhibition [at the Military Club] will be different from the others, with 160 works. It's still a lot. It is a trip for these years, for Portuguese and international politics as well. I'm full of curiosity, promoting the show, seeing what they ask me, but this is part of the game.
The Macau press does not have a large cartoon presence, with the exception of Rodrigo [Rodrigo de Matos].
I know him, I get along well with him. But I must say that the phenomenon is similar to Portugal. What do we have here? Me, at Expresso; Cristina Sampaio at Público; André Carrilho left Diário de Notícias; António Maia in Correio da Manhã and little else. This is a general trend. Sometimes, and I think this happened to me, there are moments when a cartoonist can represent an asset to the newspaper, but there are only a few moments when this can happen. In my most complicated period at Expresso, at the end of the 70s, a reference newspaper that, at the time, was in a country in turmoil, with some “irresponsibility” I was able to go ahead, and I have the perception that I helped the newspaper to untangle itself these limitations. But this happens in very specific periods. At that stage [after the 25th of April], I even made drawings at night that, by day, were already out of date.
Do you really have a bad shape or is it just to disguise?
I'm shy, but I'm taking care of myself. (laughs) It was never something that blocked me, I speak well in public. I'm a guy who doesn't like taking stupid risks. I've been in this building for several years and I only know the concierge because I have to, and I don't want to run the risk of having an unfriendly person who I've given trust to. I do this with the utmost naturalness.
Exhibition at the Military Club
After the lecture at Fundação Rui Cunha, this Wednesday, António will be at the University of São José today speaking to students at the “Cartoon Design: Creation of Ideas” workshop. This Friday follows the opening of the exhibition at Clube Militar, which will be on view until January 2nd.</description><pubDate>2024-12-12 00:58:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Gaming analyst Ben Lee on the new concessions: “We need something big”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/03/ben-lee-analista-de-jogo-sobre-as-novas-concessoes-precisamos-de-algo-grandioso/</link><description>Gaming analyst and consultant Ben Lee believes that much more needs to be done to diversify Macau's economy beyond gaming, especially taking into account the type of events organized under the new concessions. The analyst thinks Macau could look to two resorts in Vietnam as examples to follow to attract international tourists
 
What is your assessment of the two years of new gaming concessions?
There is still a lot of work to do. From what we could see so far, dealers have focused on lighter projects, such as local art galleries, cultural events, concerts and small rehabilitation of cultural neighborhoods. Large projects, such as the high -tech amusement park, the conservatory or new hotels have not yet been seen. Since two of the ten years have passed [concession], and given that the construction of some of these projects should take several years, it seems that it will be necessary to add them. The non-game segment revenues, in a percentage of gross revenue obtained by the dealers, seem to be higher than 2019, but have diminished in the last two years. It is possible to return to the next two years to be between the 10.5 and 11 percent verified in 2019.
Recently, Ho Iat Seng thanked the concessionaires for fulfilling the contracts and collaborating in the development of the non-gaming segment, reiterating that they managed to make some profits during the pandemic. Do you think your words were fair?
Casinos are making efforts to develop the non-gaming segment, but once again, most of these efforts are focused on lighter, lower-level events. We don't see big ideas like the $2.3 billion investment sphere that we see in Las Vegas, for example. If this happened, it would easily fit into the commitments of 15 billion dollars promised by the concessionaires [when signing the new contracts]. We could also talk about the idea of ​​holding a Formula 1 competition on the street, as seen in Singapore and recently in Las Vegas.
How do you analyze the recovery of operators in terms of gaming revenue in recent months?
The recovery of the game in Macao has been extremely good, and the sector is expected to recover to about 78 or 79 percent of the levels recorded in 2019.
The Macao Game Society (SJM), for example, was one of the game operators with the greatest difficulty in terms of cash flow during the pandemic. Do you consider that your recovery, compared to the other five, was positive?
The SJM had difficulties at first, but it seems to be finally making some progress. But there will still be some challenges to reposition your hardware [facilities and other enterprises] in the future.
What can we expect from the new Sam Hou Fai Government in the gaming area?
The chief executive elected seems to be trying to ensure that operators honor their commitments. Your two terms will probably cover the next eight years of the new concessions. I think that, ultimately, everything will be known to know if he can motivate the various government appliances to perform his vision and mission.
As part of the new contracts, how do you see the global evolution of the gaming sector?
In 2019, the percentage of non-game segment revenues compared to the game's recipes reached 10.5 percent. This percentage rose to 22 percent during COVID-19, and has since gradually fallen to 13.5 percent, according to the third quarter of this year. This percentage will continue to decrease as game recipes continue to grow. In recent times we have seen residents of Macau and Hong Kong go to the north [China] to save money. The question that arises is why the inhabitants of the continent would go down and do the reverse? The solution, as provided by the authorities, is that Macau needs to diversify the market [of tourists and players] that comes from the continent. This makes perfect sense in terms of logic, but the reality is that our efforts seem to be regressing. Visitors from outside the Greater China represented 7.8 percent of the total visitors from Macao, but decreased to 6.5 percent by the end of September this year. This refers to the lightweight events that have been organized that, by far and largely, are really oriented to the Chinese who, after all, constitute most of our source of recipes.
How can this situation be turned around?
Returning to the beginning, I think we really need something large, iconic, similar to the sphere in Las Vegas or even something like the “Golden Bridge” project in Da Nang, worthy of appearing on Instagram, or “Bridge From the kiss ”, in Phu Quoc, both in Vietname. The fact that these projects were built by a local group linked to the hotel sector, without any connection to profits from the game, demonstrates long -term creativity and perspective in terms of planning.
Class struggle
Ben Lee warns of the danger of the mass market “fleeing” Macau
The conversation with Ben Lee comes in the context of a lecture that recently starred in the two years of new game concessions. Promoted by the France-Macau Chamber of Commerce, the session was named “Macau New Gaming Landscape: Two Years Into Concessions, What Now?”, Having Igamix Management &amp; Consulting, according to Asian Gaming Brief, according to the portal Gaming Brief (AgBrief), that the VIP game did not end completely, thus being the target of a new classification.
According to AGBrief, citing words from Ben Lee, “the mass game has incorporated the same echelon [of players] that was so openly criticized by the Government”, but that operators “are changing their focus to accommodate it”.
The analyst highlighted the “recent focus on transforming older, smaller hotel rooms into luxury options, with all operators understanding the need to achieve quality over quantity.”
However, he argued that “the focus on the luxury segment continues to create an impasse”, as “Macau has long focused on increasing the number of visitors in order to increase revenue”, but the business model “goes against the need to increase expenses per person.”
Ben Lee also warned that many tourists could, in fact, start choosing other more affordable destinations. The analyst argued that mass players "cannot be ignored" as they remain "the main engine" of the sector. "Exorbitant prices from hotel rooms can be a" dam "for the increase of visitors," as, as suggested, "gamblers can go to other vacation places, such as Thailand, if the price is not good." This Asian country “is growing and is expected to exceed Singapore in terms of gross revenues” at a time when Thai work in the new legislation on the game.
“They hope to approve their gambling law in May next year. Assuming this happens, there are three to five years to build an integrated resort or development. They could be up and running considerably before Japan opens,” said Ben Lee.

The film is one of Miguel Gomes' films shown at the Film Festival between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries, which is running until December 13th, the day on which “Grand Tour” is shown.
 
He is one of the directors in focus at this film festival taking place in Macau. How do you feel about the opportunity to show your latest film, “Grand Tour”, in this region?
Being able to show the film anywhere in the world is always a goal for someone who wants to make films, as they only exist from the moment they are seen. The film has a relationship with Asia and China. It was bought for Hong Kong, and I don't know if it will be shown commercially in the territory and what the distributors' plans are. Regardless of this festival in Macau, the film will have visibility in that part of China.
The film is a tribute to old cinema, at least that's how I saw it.
No. I think that cinema does not need to be honored, because the history of cinema is a heritage that we honor by watching it. It is very important that this memory continues to be part of our lives and that the films can be shown. In Lisbon we are lucky to have a very competent and strong cinema library that fulfills this mission. Today's cinema is alive, despite not having as strong a social role as it did in the 20th century, and I don't think it needs homage. “Grand Tour” is a film of today, but let's say it has the memory of other films that were made. I don't intend to pay homage to cinema, but rather to explore the potential it has, doing two very different things.
What are they?
One of them will have to do, in fact, with the history of cinema and its historical heritage, which I connect with studio work. This is something that cinema has done a lot, inventing worlds that are not our real world. On the other hand, I wanted to capture reality, because cinema also has this potential to put the House ahead of people, film events, places and be able to record it.
When I refer to this tribute to ancient cinema, I refer to the presence of a certain way of filming that it has been in vogue. Did you want to mix old and contemporary cinematic elements?
I wanted to work with Asia manufactured, which never existed, that cinema created.
With the Western view of Asia.
The vision that Americans and Europeans created. Much of American cinema was invented by Europeans, people like [Josef Von] Sternberg, who left Germany and was the maximum exponent of a film author who worked with an image of the romanticized Asia.
And filmed in Macao, even. [The movie “Macao”, 1952]
Exactly. I wanted to work with this imaginary, trying to create a dialogue in which we could leave the studio and be in an Asia that corresponded to a colonial time in many of those countries, but that later, at other times, we could be in a present time. This time would be the future of the characters, in another post-colonial historical time.
“Grand Tour” was the name given to the route that many Westerners took to discover a certain Asia. To make the film, I assume some historical research was necessary. What was this process like?
I would not call her a very deep research, because that was not the goal. [The "Grand Tour"] is not a sociological movie, it's a movie costume. It's more like this side than on the sociopolitical side, let's say. The starting point was two pages of a travel book [the tale ‘Mabel’ by W. Somerset Maugham], who gave us this itinerary. The situation described [in the tale] corresponds to what we see in the movie, with a couple of bride and groom, with him living in Burma and she returning from London. He panics and runs away the day when he is supposed to go to the pier of Rangum. The couple then makes this itinerary, and in the book she can catch the groom and get married, but in the movie is different.
I assume it is difficult to compare movies. But do you understand that the "Grand Tour" marks a turning into your career over previous productions?
I don't think so. It's a personal movie, like all those I had the opportunity to do. It is personal in the sense that limitations or any production notebook of the producer have not been imposed. I could do exactly what I wanted. I see common elements of this movie to others I made. I think it is part of my work. Then there was the issue of receiving the film and the fact that he won a prize in Cannes [best director], which obviously helps me continue to work and have a more favorable receptivity right now.
It is a great recognition.
Before making this movie I was trying to do another in Brazil, an adaptation of Euclides da Cunha's book, “The Sertões”, and is a complicated project that involves a great production logistics. During the time he was trying to make the film it was difficult [to continue] for several reasons, and one of them is named Jair Bolsonaro [former president of the country]. Today we are resuming this process of returning to the movie. There was a height of discouragement, when I thought I really had to give up the project, and today the process of refinancing of the film is advancing much faster. The perspectives are more encouraging.
Do you feel that the prize won at Cannes is also for Portuguese cinema?
I hope so. For my part, I have no doubt that what I do owe it to the efforts of other filmmakers who filmed before me, and some of them continue to do so. They had to confront the characteristics of our market and society, managed to shoot in a country where there is no industry because there is no market for it. They had to fight hard to be able to shoot and make the movies they made. I recognize an experience of identity in these films, I review myself, although the movies are all very different. There is, in fact, this identity in the history of Portuguese cinema, perhaps from the 1960s, with Cinema Novo, with producers and directors who fought hard to shoot. They made movies that, for me, are very important. Nowadays, with the system created with their fight, it is easier for me and my colleagues than it will have been in the 60s and 70s.
Political conditions were also different, with less investment.
Political conditions changed over time, but their lives were not easy either after April 25, 1974. The way in which Portuguese cinema managed to impose itself and gain space for it to exist was fought in historical times and interlocutors different. And it was difficult.
Let's go back to the "Grand Tour". He said in an interview that the movie's shooting was "Surrealist." What moments that highlight this phase?
When I said that I was referring to a specific moment during the filming, in China, which was very surreal. This happened thousands of kilometers away, I was in Lisbon because I couldn't enter the country because of Covid-19. After waiting two years to be able to film, I decided that the only way to make the film would be to have a Chinese team and me to be in Lisbon and shoot remotely. I was in an Airbnb in Areeiro, surrounded by monitors and discussing what should be filmed with the Chinese team. It was all very surrealistic then, yes.
Have you ever been afraid of not being able to capture the essence of the place, of Asian culture, taking into account all these conditions?
I thought it wouldn't work. I suspect the technique a lot, I'm quite analog, and I thought it wasn't going to work. To result, it had to have the image live, give a "action" and a "cut" in real time, which could have the overall image, which was around the place beyond the image of the camera. I needed to have a communication system that worked with the photography director and the chamber official to be able to give him indications at the time we were filming. This was all possible, and I was amazed at it. On the other hand, the idea of ​​capturing the essence of the place, or a deeper thing of the culture of one of these countries, in this case in China, it seems to me too heavy. That was not my intention in the movie, because it is impossible. I believe a movie is always the result of a negotiation between someone who looks and what exists to look at. There is a subjective side. What interests us, which appeals to us, who dialogues with us and raises the desire to film can exist in China, Vietname, Africa or here on the coffee terrace where we are. I left for Asia as I left for the area of ​​Arganil to make a previous movie, "that dear month of August."
In a village.
Yes, a rural area of ​​Portugal, and I don't know if I looked differently in one situation or another. There is always anything that I think is beautiful or that touches me in different ways. What happens in "Grand Tour" is a series of mismatches, the couple's, but it seems to me that there is also a mismatch between those European characters in the relationship with the territory. It seems that they are always disconnected from the space where they live. They live a lot in a bubble.
But colonialism was also a bit like that.
Yes. I agree, I think there are people who can see this in the film, this dissociation between what the characters are experiencing and what is happening around them. We often chose not to translate what was happening in front of them so that the Western viewer could be as intrigued and lost as the characters themselves. I also think that, nowadays, there is an idea, which I completely disagree with, that cinema exists to correct history and all the injustices in the world. It is also too heavy a task for cinema. It seems deeply inappropriate to me, because cinema is not a court to judge nor a space to punish spectators and characters, it is something else. Films don't have to be denunciations, prisoners of expectation. I tried to make a film where the colonial issue could be dealt with, but without having to punish either the spectators or the characters.
What was your relationship with Asia or your idea of ​​orientalism?
I wanted to work on the idea that there was an Asia invented and manufactured by the European gaze, and I was aware that this existed and that I had to work with it in the film. The world of fiction, on the other hand, has as one of its aspects this idea of ​​exoticism, regardless of the sociological issue, of having had a Western look at the East, almost like a superficial view of that world. But fiction works with stereotypes, and that's not a bad thing. It's the cement to later do anything with these stereotypes.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion. , expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied this right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on staying, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of whipping, mutilation and death , systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
The gentlemen we are talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist popular organization and action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. Furthermore, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Tennis | Nuno Borges will play in front of Alcaraz in the Australia Open</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/16/tenis-nuno-borges-vai-jogar-frente-a-alcaraz-no-open-da-australia/</link><description>Nuno Borges overcame his nervousness on Wednesday to defeat Australian Jordan Thompson, in three sets, in the second round of the Australian Open, and will now face 'Carlitos' Alcaraz without pressure, the Portuguese tennis player admitted to the Lusa agency.
“I feel like it was a good game on my part. Without a doubt, it was better than the first round, the sensations were there”, he began by analyzing the national number one, speaking to the Lusa agency, after advancing to the third round of the first Grand Slam of the season.
The 27-year-old Maiato contradicted Wednesday the favoritism of the 'local' Jordan Thompson, 27th standard head, imposed on 6-3, 6-2 and 6-4 partials in one hour and 47 minutes, in a John Cain Arena - the third most important court by Melbourne Park - crowded.
“I was quite nervous, it was a big stadium, it doesn't happen every day [that happens], so I think that within that I managed to play a very good game and I'm really happy with the result”, he pointed out.
Head to Alcaraz
Semi-finalist in Auckland at the start of the year, Borges has now extended his good form, setting up a meeting in the third round with Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, third player in the world.
“Now, against ‘Carlitos’, there’s not much to say. Everyone knows what he is capable of and everything he has done, [he is] quite famous all over the world, there is not much to highlight”, he declared about his opponent who, in Australia, seeks to become the youngest tennis player (he is 21 years old) completing a career Grand Slam.
Against the Spaniard, the 33rd ranked player in the ATP rankings will try to do his best and “make him as uncomfortable as possible”. “I'm going to play without pressure, try not to put too many expectations in my head to see if I can bring my best tennis”, he concluded.
Last year, Nuno Borges, who will still start his walk in the pairs alongside Francisco Cabral, became the first Portuguese tennis player to reach the round of 16 at the Australia Open.</description><pubDate>2025-01-16 22:38:03</pubDate></item><item><title>After “very positive meeting”, Borges “looking forward to playing in a stadium” with Thompson</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/14/apos-encontro-muito-positivo-borges-ansioso-por-jogar-num-estadio-com-thompson/</link><description>Portuguese tennis player Nuno Borges made his debut yesterday, the 13th, in the 113th edition of the Australian Open, the first Major of the season, with a “very positive encounter” against Frenchman Alexandre Muller at Melbourne Park, where he will now face the Australian Jordan Thompson.
“I am very happy. It was a very positive meeting. I think that, overall, I served very well, at least I managed to put the ball where I wanted and have a good percentage (69%). I felt like I remained pretty constant, except in the tie-break of the first set, which I didn't play very well. I always remained looking and very consistent during the meeting and that ended up being the key to the result”, he commented in statements to the Lusa agency.
The world's national and 33rd number one needed two hours and 55 minutes to get the best of the Gaul opponent, recently champion of the Hong Kong ATP 250, in four sets, by the 6-7 (2-7) partials (2-7). , 6-3, 6-2 and 7-5, but believes it has deserved the triumph, in the return to Melbourne, where a year ago became in the first Portuguese tennis player to reach the round of 16.
“I feel like I deserved to win in four sets, I was slightly higher from the first set and I'm very happy. The first rounds are never easy in terms of sensations. Tennis does not flow the same way, is trying to gain pace, but fortunately meetings at the best of five sets give more time to find this pace. I feel that I ended up the meeting quite well, although exhausting too, ”he explained.
After the victory in the opening round, Nuno Borges will “take the opportunity to rest and recover tomorrow to possibly play on Wednesday” with a home player, Jordan Thompson (27th ATP), who today beat the qualifier at the Margaret Court Arena German Dominik Koepfer also in four partials, by 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, 4-6 and 6-3.
“I hope it’s a good opportunity to play in a stadium possibly, I’m looking forward to it. We played a long time ago [Estoril Open 2021]. In 2024, he had a great season, quite impressive and I know that he, here in Australia, competes very well, always available to play five sets. I know that I will have to play my best tennis and I am waiting for another great challenge, perhaps even more challenging than today”, concluded Borges, winner of the only duel with Thompson.</description><pubDate>2025-01-14 16:15:44</pubDate></item><item><title>GT Cup | Great Bay Race gains momentum from the Interior</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/taca-gt-corrida-da-grande-baia-ganha-impulso-do-interior/</link><description>The GT Cup-Great Bay Race will be part of this year, the newly created Sro GT Cup, the latest GT competition launched in the interior of China, inspired by the GT4 class vehicles of the Macau Grand Prix
 
On the eve of last Christmas, Sro Motorsport Group, the entity responsible for organizing numerous races and championships, including the GT World Challenge Asia and, as the official partner of the FIA, the co-coordination of the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau , announced the creation of a competition for GT4 vehicles, consisting of four events in China. At the time of the announcement, only the inaugural event in Shanghai and the end in Beijing had been confirmed as part of the calendar.
Almost 30 cars, representing an impressive total of ten car builders, participated in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race of 2024, a race that has become an important milestone over the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix in recent years. Indeed, no other GT4 event in Asia brings together such quantity and diversity of cars. The Balance of Performance (BOP), responsible for balancing the performance of the various participating cars, was, at the time, managed by SRO.
In a statement, Benjamin Franassovici, General Director of SRO Motorsports Asia, said:
“We are delighted, proud and privileged to add the GT Cup – Greater Bay Area Race to the inaugural SRO GT Cup calendar, which begins and ends with China's two biggest motorsport events. We already have a strong working relationship with the GT Cup – Greater Bay Area Race, which has become the most significant race for GT4 cars in Asia. Its inclusion in the SRO’s 2025 calendar underlines the scale of our ambition for this new national series.”
High interest
The SRO GT Cup debut season starts in March at China's Formula 1 Grand Prix in Shanghai, before moving to the Zhuhai International Circuit - a place previously visited by SRO in BPR times and the FIA ​​GT Championship - where two 30 minutes races are planned. This is followed by the new Citadine Circuit of Beijing, which will host the GT World Challenge Asia on the same weekend, before the big end of the Sro GT Cup season, scheduled for a month later at the Guide Circuit in Macao.
The enthusiasm surrounding this competition is evident. As Benjamin Franassovici highlighted, “this is reflected in the number of inquiries and registrations for the full season we have received since the launch of the championship, just before Christmas. Demand exceeded our expectations.”
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the season end event on the streets of Macau, with places to be assigned based on the classification after the second round of the championship, which is scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit. All pilots with “bronze” or “silver” classifications attributed by the FIA ​​are eligible to compete in this competition, as long as they use approved cars from the GT4 class.
To attract brands, SRO GT Cup race results will count towards the SRO GT4 Constructors' Ranking, a title awarded to the best performing brand in the GT4 category at the end of each season. The SRO GT Cup joins its Asian equivalent, the Japan Cup, in a list that also includes continental and national competitions in Europe, America and Australia.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 11:13:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorsport | Rui Valente does not give up</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/automobilismo-rui-valente-nao-se-da-por-vencido/</link><description>Rui Valente will return this year for another season in motorsport in the region. The Macao pilot has been in the active for the same time and will play the Macau Roadsport Challenge, the tourist cars competition organized by the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), as well as the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix , in November
 
With the same enthusiasm that has been recognized for decades, Rui Valente will again drive, in the 2025 season, a Subaru BRZ, the same car he competed in at the Guia Circuit, last November, in the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. In the race held at the territory's event, the Portuguese driver finished in sixth place, after losing some positions at the start, where he dropped to tenth. The result was not even better because the race, held in the rain, ended prematurely due to an accident by an opponent.
In the competition for local drivers, which currently combines starting grids with more than fifty cars, all of them Toyota GR86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8), Rui Valente admitted to HM that he “will not give up”, further revealing who “misses being on the podium, both in China and in Macau…”.
Premium Racing Team driver had, in the last Macao Grand Prix, one of the fastest in terms of tip speed in the platoon of his race. Therefore, the bet for this year will be in other technical aspects of the car that go beyond the engine.
"At this time, I just wanted to increase the diameter of the front wheels and widen the gauge to improve the car's behavior," he confided to HM, also reporting that he intends to "optimize weight transmission during the curve and its. exit". These improvements, along with lock system updates, should increase the competitiveness of the Japanese machine in a fierce grid, consisting of Macau, Hong Kong pilots and China interior, with constantly evolving cars.
Undefined calendar
The calendar of events for the automobile competition organized by AAMC has not yet been revealed. In 2024, the Macau Roadsport Challenge debuted at the Zhuzhou International Circuit, in eastern Hunan province, but Rui Valente would prefer the competition to return this year to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC), in Zhaoqing.
“I was very fond of returning to Gic, because I have everything there,” says the Portuguese pilot, defender of the track located in the neighboring province. “When you go to a qualification test, for those who make four races and then Macau, if you are on a track you already know, such as GIC, where you are seven or more years, each time you get on the track and try to do better than which last means you are improving and improving your driving. So you know you soon that you are stronger that year to Macau. ”
On the other hand, for the experienced pilot of the territory, “if you go to a new track, like the Zhuzhou circuit, besides floors there to learn the new layout and improve your time, you will never know if you are really stronger For Macao, as you know when you run in the gic. ”
Like what happened in past seasons, the Macao Roadsport Challenge calendar is expected to be composed of two weekends, with two races each, which also serve as an determination for the Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:47:48</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Luca Engstler is still recovering from the accident</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/12/gp-macau-luca-engstler-ainda-recupera-do-acidente/</link><description>Despite every year the Organizing Committee of the Macau Grand Prix puts a lot of resources and a lot of energy into the safety of drivers, the Guia Circuit continues, and will continue, to be one of the most dangerous and risky in the world. This year, the young German Luca Engstler, who participated in a GT3 car for the first time, felt the old maxim of this circuit firsthand: “you pay dearly for mistakes”
 
Eight weeks after the most serious accident of his career, the 24-year-old driver is still recovering from the unfortunate misfortune in the FIA ​​GT World Cup qualifying session at the 71st Macau Grand Prix. On Friday afternoon, with the clock ticking and when he was trying to improve his record, Luca Engstler lost control of his Lamborghini Huracán GT3 EVO in the dreaded Mandarin Curve, crashing at more than 230 km/h into the protective barriers. The car registered by Liqui Moly Team Engstler, but prepared and raced by the Grasser Racing Team, was completely destroyed and the German driver even fell unconscious after the impact.
“This is a unique event, Lamborghini's progress was not very good and to be ahead we had to risk more than the others. Basically, I was completely thoroughly and was unsuccessful, ”said Luca Engstler, at the time, the accident she suffered. Two months after what was “the most horrible day of my life to this day,” former German Touring Champion (TCR) is still in the recovery process.
“It was really a big impact,” said Luca Engstler, in conversation with the specialized portal motorsport-total.com, who needed a wheelchair after the accident. “The big problem was that my right ankle suffered a lot. I tore the lateral ligaments and had a lot of hemorrhages in tibia and fibula, which caused some concern, ”he recalled.
Returning to walking normally was also a great challenge for the young Lamborghini driver, who in the 2024 season impressively won two DTM races and participated for the first time in a GT3 car in Macau. “It took me a long time to be able to walk,” he recalled. “For the first two or three days, I was actually in a wheelchair, because I simply couldn’t do anything and all my bones hurt,” Engstler described to his country’s publication, noting that “I had bruises everywhere and everything was difficult ”.
Recover
Even so, Lucas Engstler, at the end of the day of the accident, already at the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário, made a post on social media stating that everything was fine. The driver, who was in Macau accompanied by his father, Franz Engstler — also a driver and a well-known figure in Asian motorsport — wanted to reassure those closest to him. Two days after the accident, he appeared on the starting grid of the FIA ​​GT World Cup on Sunday, without crutches, only slightly supported by an umbrella.
“What was important to me was not wanting to make a big deal about it,” he explained to the German portal. “In the end, the accident seemed very serious, but that just shows how safe the cars are,” he highlighted.
The pilot continues to recover from the sequelae of the strong impact. He took advantage of the winter break to take a trip from Autocaravana to Sweden with his best friend. "Everything is going well," he said, clarifying that he can run. "I would say I'm 95 percent and I have no permanent damage."
After the accident, the German worked on their recovery in the Allgäu region, in their homeland, “with some acquaintances, who are physiotherapists and doctors. I received excellent assistance. ”
Return soon
Luca Engstler admits he became impatient during the recovery process. “They told me that I would only be able to do sport again at the beginning of February, but of course I couldn't accept that”, acknowledging that he started training earlier than recommended.
Fortunately for Luca Engstler, the DTM only starts on the last weekend of April. In the near future, the driver plans to get behind the wheel again, possibly in a rental kart to begin with. The aim is to be in shape for the start of pre-season and preparation tests for the popular German championship, scheduled for mid-February and early March.
As for the Macao Grand Prix, two days after the accident, Luca Engstler was quite clear: “I told everyone that my goal is to return and try to fight for victory in this great race.”</description><pubDate>2025-01-12 23:43:24</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Maro Engel clarified GT World Cup episode</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/10/gp-macau-maro-engel-esclareceu-episodio-da-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>Maro Engel won, in a race not suitable for those with heart failure, the FIA ​​GT World Cup at the 71st Macau Grand Prix. However, the German's fourth victory among us was anything but peaceful. Maro Engel took advantage of an interview with the German magazine Motorsport Aktuell to explain what happened on the streets of the territory and which earned him so much criticism
 
The German driver, who will turn 40 years old this year, had a 2024 season full of success: he won the GT World Challenge Europe, was the best of the Mercedes-AMG representatives in the DTM and achieved a fourth triumph in the Grand Prix of Macao. However, Maro Engel prefers not to highlight a single achievement in his dream 2024 season, having told his country's specialized magazine that “in terms of prestige, the victory in Macau has to be highlighted. But honestly, I don't want to highlight a single moment as the greatest achievement of this incredible year. I worked hard to achieve all these successes.”
In the Macao SAR, the Bavarian driver's triumph was offered on a platter when the race's top two finishers, Antonio Fuoco (Ferrari) and Raffaele Marciello (BMW), clashed while braking for Curva Lisboa with two laps to go. However, Maro Engel had already been involved in another incident, when, at the start of the race, at Isso da Solão, his Mercedes-AMG GT3 made a subtle contact with the rear of Dries Vanthoor's BMW, which was ahead of him in third position. The young Belgian was thrown against the barriers, ending up retiring due to damage to the M4 GT3's suspension, while Maro Engel would see the checkered flag in first place, with an advantage of 11 seconds.
Already at the end of the race, the Sports Commissioner College decided that the touch of the aforementioned tap deserved a 5 -second penalty, which had no impact on the final result, leading BMW Motorsport, Andreas Roos to tell the press that the incident “ It was not adequately penalized. ” Dries Vanthoor, who was also a candidate for victory, went further and said at the time that when “pushing another car out of track, he should not be able to win the race.”

It was not on purpose
Maro Engel's aggressive style was criticized at the time, but the driver, who won his debut in Macau in 2014, prefers to emphasize that “he does everything within the limits of fair play” and believes it is “difficult to accuse a driver of not trying everything to win there (in Macau).” In the situation in question, Maro Engel wanted to clarify that “it was clearly faster. In the wide part of the circuit, at the bottom, I had no chance of attacking, so I tried at the top. It ended up going wrong, and that wasn't my intention. I apologized to Dries later. In general, I race to win. The day I no longer give it my all, I'll hang up my helmet. I’m definitely not here to make new friends.”
Despite the “musical chairs” between the car manufacturers involved in the GT3 class this pre-season, Maro Engel will continue to defend the colors of Mercedes-AMG, something he has done since 2008, and will naturally be one of the Stuttgart brand's choices for the World Cup in November, at the Guia Circuit. The Munich-born driver doesn’t see himself retiring from the track anytime soon, as “I haven’t reached my peak yet and I continue to find pleasure in racing.”
On his resume, in races held in Macau, Maro Engel has two victories in the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup (2015 and 2024) and another two in the Macau GT Cup (2014 and 2022), but promises not to stop here.</description><pubDate>2025-01-10 06:21:42</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
