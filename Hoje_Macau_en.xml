The news was released at a time when an investigation is being carried out in Seoul in response to Pyongyang's accusations about the presence of drones in North Korea, in September 2025 and at the beginning of this year.
The first suspect, a man in his 30s, who apparently only worked on manufacturing the drone, was a news supervisor in the presidential spokesperson's office during the Yoon government, according to the agency.
The other suspect, also in his 30s and also working at the presidential complex during the Yoon government, publicly claimed to have operated the drones, in an interview broadcast on Friday by local channel Channel A. The suspect is currently pursuing postgraduate studies in journalism at a private university in Seoul.
The two suspects studied at the same university and founded a drone manufacturing company in 2024, according to Yonhap.
The investigation does not specify the exact years they worked for Yoon, who began his term in May 2022 and ended in April last year, after being removed by the brief declaration of martial law in December 2024.
Yoon Suk-yeol, currently in pre-trial detention, faces charges of abuse of power and other crimes related to the alleged sending of drones to North Korea to disseminate anti-Pyongyang propaganda.
The Public Ministry alleges that the then president ordered the operation to provoke a reaction from the neighboring country and justify the imposition of martial law.
Flights of discord
North Korea accused the South at the UN, in February last year, of sending drones in October 2024 to spread propaganda over the capital Pyongyang.
Yonhap's work also indicates that the first suspect was already interrogated on Friday by the investigation team of the South Korean armed forces and police.
The man was reported to the authorities in November for flying an unregistered drone in the Yeoju area, about 70 kilometers southeast of Seoul, and the model of the device coincided with the one North Korea claims to have shot down in the most recent report.
In an interview with a local channel, the second suspect said that, since September last year, he had carried out several flights over North Korea and that the objective was to measure the levels of radiation and contamination by heavy metals in a uranium factory near the Ryesong River, in North Korean territory.
North Korea reported on January 10 that South Korean drones flew over the territory in September last year and again on January 4 this year.
The government of the current South Korean President, Lee Jae-myung, denied that the drones were military aircraft and began an investigation this week, without ruling out the possibility of civilian involvement.
The North Korean accusation came as a surprise, given that Lee had told the EFE news agency in December that Seoul might have to apologize to Pyongyang for alleged drone flights during Yoon's presidency.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 14:18:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Health | Meeting brings together authorities from Macau, Hong Kong and Mainland China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/saude-reuniao-junta-autoridades-de-macau-hong-kong-e-interior-da-china/</link><description>Last Thursday, the MSAR hosted the 20th Joint Meeting of the Health Administration Summits of Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, where the training of qualified staff, community health and the development of intelligent healthcare were discussed.
The meeting brought together more than 70 senior health administration officials and medical experts from the three territories also with the objectives of “deepening the exchange, sharing of experiences and discussion on the future direction of cooperation”, the Health Services indicated on Friday.
The Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam, highlighted that the Macao SAR Government will implement the strategy of giving “health priority” included in the “National Fifteenth Five-Year Plan” and execute the “Action Plan for Healthy Macau”, integrating physical and mental health elements into public policies. The leader also highlighted the launch of the “Well-being and Health Station” program, to take advantage of health resources in community neighborhoods.
Complying with the national “Year of Weight Management” initiative, O Lam stated that “community health self-examination stations will be increased” and residents will be encouraged to “be ‘first responsible’ for their own health”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 13:38:15</pubDate></item><item><title>New association wants to contribute to the study of law in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/nova-associacao-quer-contribuir-para-o-estudo-de-direito-em-macau/</link><description>The Association of Legal Studies of Macau and Portugal was created to give life to a mega undertaking, the publication of the annotated Macau Civil Procedure Code, and, later, of works “outside the most popular topics”.
David Sá Machado, a Portuguese lawyer working in Macau, is the ideologue of what will be the first annotated version, published in full, of the Civil Procedure Code of the semi-autonomous Chinese region.
The three volumes, with the contribution of around 60 authors, including “lawyers, magistrates, academic professors, advisors and other jurists from Portugal and Macau”, should see the light of day later this year, the person responsible explains to Lusa, noting that they are in the review phase. “If there are changes to the code planned, we may delay a little”, he adds.
To facilitate the publication of the work, “an added value” that aims to be a “contribution to law in Macau”, the Association of Legal Studies of Macau and Portugal was created.
“Other projects will emerge later”, says Lusa Sá Machado, president of the association, indicating the intention of, in the future, organizing “more pedagogical and more didactic initiatives”.
Still talking about this project of around three thousand pages and coordinated by two women – Maria José Capelo, associate professor at the Faculty of Law at the University of Coimbra, and Teresa Leong, retired judge from Macau – the lawyer notes that it will be produced in Portuguese, although a Chinese version is also planned, as “the target audience is jurists from Macau”.
“An annotated code should serve to clarify the reader of the various interpretative meanings of the norms and, perhaps, add something from the point of view of the right to be constituted”, he indicates. “I think it always enriches any legal system”, he adds
Existing versions
Macau has annotated versions of the Civil Code, the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, and between 2006 and 2008, the first two volumes of the annotated and commented Code of Civil Procedure were published, authored by Cândida da Silva Antunes Pires and Viriato de Lima. The work, however, remained unfinished, recalls the lawyer.
Sá Machado, also one of the authors, defends the importance of the project: "We are always using Portuguese codes, Portuguese notes. We are left with something of our own."
Still talking about the work, which will be published in Portugal by Edições Almedina – after making “some approaches in Macau, informally” -, the lawyer says that “I would like it to be a reference work”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Two more shows with Japanese artists canceled</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/cancelados-mais-dois-espectaculos-com-artistas-japoneses/</link><description>The shows by the boy band Nexz, made up of Japanese and Korean artists, were canceled on Friday, without any official explanation, according to a statement from concessionaire Sands China. The two concerts were scheduled for Saturday and Sunday and were sold out.
Initially, the band managed by JYP, one of the main Korean entertainment companies, had only planned one concert in Macau. However, the great demand, as early as December, led to a second show being scheduled the following day.
On Friday, one day before the first concert, the cancellation occurred. “We inform you that the concert “NEXZ SPECIAL CONCERT in MACAO”, originally scheduled for the 17th and 18th of January 2026, has been cancelled”, announced the concessionaire, via social media. “We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding and continued support,” it added.
Shows with the participation of Japanese artists in Macau began to be canceled, after a worsening of diplomatic tensions between Japan and China related to Taiwan.
Cancel culture
The wave of cancellation of shows with Japanese artists in China began in the interior. However, the trend extended to Macau. The first target in Macao was pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki, whose concert, scheduled for January 10th, was canceled on December 9th. Days earlier, on November 29, Hamasaki's concert in Shanghai had also been cancelled.
The cancellations didn't stop there, and at the beginning of the year it was time for Japanese singer Mika Nakashima's concert to be cancelled. At the time, the existence of “unavoidable circumstances” was presented as justification.
The cancellation of shows is not new. In January 2024, pressure from the IC led to the cancellation of the “Made by Beauty” show due to the participation of drag queens. However, IC president Deland Leong denied any involvement in the spate of recent cancellations.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 14:06:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | “Healthy and stable” relations serve the interests of China and Canada</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/diplomacia-relacoes-saudaveis-e-estaveis-serve-interesses-de-china-e-canada/</link><description>The Canadian government leader's visit to China marked the return of healthy understanding between the two nations after a period of tensions and disagreements.
The President of China, Xi Jinping, stated Friday that the development of “healthy and stable” relations with Canada serves the interests of both countries, during a meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister.
Xi met in Beijing with Mark Carney, in what is the first visit by a Canadian head of government to the country in almost a decade and which aims to normalize bilateral relations, which have gone through periods of tension in recent years, due to diplomatic and commercial disputes.
During the meeting, held at the Great Hall of the People, Xi stated that the “healthy and stable development” of relations between China and Canada “corresponds to the common interests of both countries” and contributes to “world peace, stability and prosperity”, according to Chinese state television CCTV.
The Chinese leader highlighted that the previous contact between the two, in October, on the sidelines of a summit in South Korea, began a new phase of rapprochement. Xi called for the construction of “a new type of strategic partnership” capable of putting ties between Beijing and Ottawa on a “sustainable and lasting” path.
Carney thanked the reception and expressed Canada's willingness to work with China “based on good past cooperation”, to develop a strategic relationship adapted to the current international context and promoting “stability, security and prosperity” for both countries and the Pacific region.
The day before, the Canadian Prime Minister met with his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang. The two discussed topics such as economic cooperation, energy and trade, and witnessed the signing of several agreements in the customs and commercial areas.
Reinforced ties
According to CCTV, Carney reiterated Canada's interest in strengthening cooperation in supply chains and strategic sectors, as well as its commitment to multilateralism and the international trade system.
Li Qiang advocated expanding cooperation in areas such as clean energy, modern agriculture, digital technologies and the aerospace industry.
Also on the sidelines of the visit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand, highlighting the need to eliminate interference and strengthen mutual trust to promote a “stable, solid and healthy” relationship.
Carney's visit is the first by a Canadian prime minister to China since Justin Trudeau's visit in 2017, and takes place in a context of growing instability in international trade, with Ottawa seeking to diversify economic partnerships.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 14:14:52</pubDate></item><item><title>CCM | Play “Goodbye, My Concubine” with workshops and activities</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/ccm-peca-adeus-minha-concubina-com-workshops-e-actvidades/</link><description>Between January 29th and February 1st, the Beijing People's Theater company presents four sessions of the play “Adeus, Minha Concubina” at Studio II of the Macau Cultural Center (CCM). Tickets cost 220 patacas and are on sale at the Enjoy Macao Ticket Office. Spectators can enjoy a 50 percent discount, “upon presentation of a valid Macau Resident Identity Card, Full-time Student Card, Macau Teacher Card, Special Benefits Card for the Elderly or Disability Assessment Registration Card”, said the Cultural Affairs Bureau on Friday.
The performance of the play presented by the Beijing People's Theater is one of the highlights of the “1st Season of Chinese Culture Shows”, which began at the end of November last year and runs until March. The cycle is organized by the IC and the Publicity, Culture and Sports Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao SAR, with the sponsorship of the Secretariat for Social Affairs and Culture.
The play, described by the organization as immersive, was written by Mo Yan, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. The IC adds that the production of “Goodbye, My Concubine” that will take the CCM stage “breaks with the traditional narrative structure of historical drama, exploring timeless themes such as power, survival and responsibility through multiple encounters and a structure of temporally intertwined dialogues between the characters Yu Ji and Lü Zhi”.
With an immersive scenic design, the audience will be surrounded by the Chu Army camp, sitting on cushions or straw benches arranged on various levels, to witness up close the intense plots of love and hate between the characters.
Learning with art
In addition to the four theater sessions, “workshops and complementary activities will also be organized that invite the public to participate and experience the beauty of traditional Chinese culture from multiple perspectives”, is described by IC.
On the 30th and 31st of January, after the show (between 10pm and 10:30pm), spectators will have the opportunity to talk to the artists. On January 27th, in anticipation, the “Inter-regional Dialogue between Young Artists” will be organized, which will feature “the main creators of the production and young actors from Mainland China and Macau”. The objective of this activity is to launch an “in-depth discussion about the construction of characters and the performing arts, deconstructing the creative process, perceptions and techniques for representing dramatic characters from multiple dimensions, such as action, personality and image”. The talk, scheduled for the Auditorium of the Macau Art Museum, is aimed at theater groups and young actors based in Macau and admission will be on a first-come, first-served basis.
In addition to the conversations, an enamel jewelry workshop will be held on January 31st between 4:30 pm and 5:30 pm in the Conference Room of the Macau Cultural Center, aimed at Macau residents over 6 years old
The next day, in the same place and at the same time, the Calligraphy Workshop for the Elderly will be held for Macau residents over 55 years of age.
Places are limited and interested parties can register on the Macau Single Account application.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Birth rate | Equality and balance between essential work and life</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/natalidade-igualdade-e-equilibrio-entre-vida-e-trabalho-essenciais/</link><description>A UPM academic believes that Macau should legislate equal parental leave, promoting gender equality and balance between personal life and work, which she claims are essential factors in reversing the drop in birth rates.
“The balance between professional and personal life is a key factor in boosting the fertility rate,” Lok Cheng, an academic at the Macau Polytechnic University (UPM) who studies public policy, told Lusa.
Lok's research, which compares Macau's parenting policies with those of countries such as Germany, Sweden and the United States, supports this conclusion.
Macau recorded the lowest birth rate in the world in 2024 and the lowest number of births in almost 50 years in 2025, said, at the beginning of the year, the deputy director of the Macau public hospital, Tai Wa Hou, quoted by the Chinese language channel of the public broadcaster TDM Macau. This decline has persisted despite a revised budget approved last year to strengthen social supports, including subsidies for parents with children up to three years old, increases in birth benefits and marriage subsidies.
Macau currently offers 70 days of maternity leave and only five days of paternity leave for workers in the private sector (in the public sector it is 90 days for mothers and five for fathers), recalled the expert: “Less than the 98 days recommended by the International Labor Organization”, she said.
This disparity, argued Lok, reinforces the idea that women have the main responsibility for newborns, which also has an impact on their professional career. “We have tacitly accepted that women have a greater responsibility for caring for newborns, and this is reflected in the workplace,” he continued.
Look out
In contrast, the expert, who is also a civil servant, points to European policies. “Sweden has a well-established parental policy and saw an increase in the birth rate in the early 2000s,” he said. “Both Germany and Sweden provide longer maternity leaves and are actively promoting father participation”, he reinforced.
Lok explained that Sweden offers more than 300 days of shared parental leave, with 90 days reserved exclusively for the father.
“Macau currently has no relevant regulations regarding fathers”, noted the academic, suggesting that the region could learn from this model to implement equal parental leave and “promote gender equality in the workplace”.
Such a policy, he said, would help families share childcare and “eliminate gender bias that places women as the main caregivers”. “This prejudice is harmful to women’s professional development”, he assessed.
According to the latest official data from the Macau Women's Database, the average monthly salary of the female population in 2024 was 16,800 patacas, lower than the 19,300 patacas earned by men.
Lok explained that many women are hesitant to have children, fearing increased family duties and career stagnation. But when childcare is shared, “this can increase the desire to have children and reduce the associated costs”.
Such a change would also benefit women professionally, he added. If parental duties were distributed more equally, “companies would be less concerned about gender when hiring women of childbearing age, and women would be able to pursue careers on an equal footing.”
Lok acknowledged that it may be a challenge for Macau to adopt a system like Sweden's, but it is necessary to “move forward gradually”. “The first step is to increase maternity leave to 98 days, in accordance with international standards”, he concluded.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 13:54:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | VIP revenues rose 24.1% throughout 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/jogo-receitas-vip-subiram-241-ao-longo-de-2025/</link><description>Revenues from high rollers, a segment known in Macau as VIP gaming, rose 24.1 percent in 2025, according to official data released on Friday. The VIP baccarat game reached revenues of MOP68 billion last year, revealed the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Department (DICJ).
In the last quarter alone, revenue from big bets increased by 45 percent compared to the period between October and December 2024, to 20.3 billion patacas.
However, VIP gaming in Macau remains far from the historic peaks reached before the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2019, baccarat for this segment represented 46.2 percent of total casino revenues. But in 2025 it was left with a share of 27.5 percent.
Big bets were affected by the arrest of the leader of the largest VIP bet collecting company in the world, in November 2021.
The former executive director of Suncity Alvin Chau Cheok Wa was sentenced, in January 2023, to 18 years in prison, in a case that saw the number of gambling promoter licenses issued in Macau drop from 85 to 18.
According to data from DICJ, the number of licenses has been recovering and reached the mark of 30 at the end of July, a number that was maintained in the most recent update, on December 15th. Even so, it remains below the maximum limit set by the Government, which is 50.
Number to increase
Revenues from the most popular game in Macau, baccarat in the so-called mass market, also increased by 3.4 percent in 2025, to 137.9 billion patacas.
Mass baccarat represented 57.7 percent of total casino revenue in the territory last year, being by far the most popular game of chance among Chinese gamblers.
Gaming machine revenue increased by 7.3 percent compared to 2024, to MOP13.9 billion.
In 2025, Macau's casinos recorded total revenue of 247.4 billion patacas, an increase of 9.1 percent.
The Macau Government had forecast, in the initial budget for 2025, gaming revenue of 240 billion patacas, which would represent an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
However, on June 11, the Legislative Assembly approved a new budget, proposed by the Executive, which reduced the forecast for public revenue by 4.56 billion patacas.
The Secretary for Economy and Finance, Anton Tai Kin Ip, admitted to deputies that the cut was due to the fact that the game's gross revenues in the first quarter of 2025 were “slightly below expectations”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 13:45:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Portuguese in Macau ask for attention from those far away</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/eleicoes-portugueses-em-macau-pedem-atencao-a-quem-esta-longe/</link><description>Outside the historic building of the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau, Portuguese people who chose to vote on Saturday celebrate the democratic moment and demand “more care” for those who live far away. Several voters again suggested the implementation of electronic voting.
It was a “somewhat confusing - as the world is at the moment -” presidential campaign, but one that Cristina Osswald made a point of following. And on this sunny, winter day in Macau, the Portuguese celebrate the possibility of choice. "Whenever possible I would listen to interviews, debates and presentations of the candidates. But it seemed to me that, perhaps, there is this issue of a dispersion of votes, which is part of democracy, isn't it? And especially when you live in a regime that is not democratic, you clearly appreciate democracy more", the professor at the Macau Polytechnic University tells Lusa after voting.
But the path that a Macau voter takes until the moment of voting, highlights Osswald, is not ideal. Having lived outside of Portugal for six years, the teacher notes that “procedures have improved”, although “they remain below expectations”. “The world is increasingly global, I see no reason why there should not be electronic voting”, considers the teacher, who, before Macau, passed through Florence, where to vote she had to go to Milan. “We can go to the bank [‘online’], to the finance department, and not being able to vote ‘online’ seems like something that doesn’t make much sense. I think that would be where there should also be greater investment. For example, here, people with little mobility cannot come and vote”, she declares.
Cristina Osswald looks at the staircase that leads to the consulate, where at that moment, elderly people are climbing the steps with difficulty – despite the fact that, at the back of the building, there is another door with access to an elevator.
"It is democracy that is losing. In times that are complicated and, I would say, almost dramatic, I think it would be an extremely simple thing to be able to vote online", continues the professor, also referring to the "little information" in Macau about the procedures leading up to the election. “I know a lot of people here in Macau, especially older people, who don't come to vote, because it wasn't announced that we had to register beforehand”, he notes.
Ancient pretension
Electronic choice has been a long-standing demand of the Council of Portuguese Communities, the Government's advisory body for policies relating to emigration and Portuguese communities abroad. Rui Marcelo, president of the Regional Council of the Portuguese Communities of Asia and Oceania, told Lusa last year that the topic “was addressed several times and with several governments”.
Félix Teixeira, a retired laboratory technician who has lived in Macau for 30 years, argues that online voting could serve especially regions where “travel is difficult”. “Macau is small, it doesn’t matter here.”
And what expectations do you have from the presidential elections? For the former employee of the Institute for Municipal Affairs, the multiplicity of faces on the bulletins is a good omen: “More voices are heard”, he says. And for emigrants, he emphasizes, being here today means getting closer to home: “If you are not in direct contact with the country, you are outside the entire circuit, politics and the social sphere”, he adds.
Feel from a distance
According to the consulate, there are more than 150 thousand Portuguese passport holders among residents of Macau and Hong Kong. However, when registered to vote, the number is almost three times lower: 57,748, according to data provided to Lusa by the diplomatic representation.
From the top of the stairs of the historic consulate building – formerly Hospital de São Rafael, founded in 1569 – the Macanese couple Francisco Xavier Leong and Alina da Luz ask for more attention from those abroad. “We hope that the new president will be more careful with foreign citizens, not just from Portugal”, says Leong. “We vote because we are Portuguese and, as good citizens, it is our duty”, adds the woman.
For the couple, who live nearby, voting in person is simpler. Francisco Leong even admits “more difficulty” with the electronic option. "Fortunately, in Portugal we have always had great confidence in the electoral results. There are many people who have doubts about electronic voting, but I think that if it is conducted well, it is a good option", says, in turn, José Paulo Esperança.
To Lusa, the Finance professor at the City University of Macau says he expects high participation in the ballot, because “there are concerns for Portuguese democracy” and “worrying candidates”. "Portugal – and the world – is experiencing developments that worry me. Because there is an increasing rise in the extreme right and phenomena that are very worrying", he states.
In the 2021 presidential elections, 1,479 people voted in Macau, or 2.1 percent of the total registered (70,134). Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa won in this Chinese region with 64.62 percent of the votes, followed by Ana Gomes (14.45 percent) and André Ventura (8.03 percent).</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 13:41:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Government | Sam Hou Fai talks about “good start” to his term</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/governo-sam-hou-fai-fala-de-bom-inicio-de-mandato/</link><description>The Chief Executive considers that the Government has made “a good start”. It was in this way that Sam Hou Fai took stock of the first year of governance, in a meeting with 70 members of the Administration to reiterate the need for rulers to “implement the spirit” of Xi Jinping's speeches.
According to the official version of the meeting, released by the Social Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai “stated that the work of the first year of this government took place in a stable, successive and peaceful manner, with reforms, innovations, advances and results”, which he considered to be “a good start”.
The Chief Executive praised public services for having as a priority “the fundamental interests of the Country and the integral interests of Macau” which are seen as “the starting point for installing a global mentality that firmly guarantees the sovereignty, national security and development interests of the Country, and ensures the stable and harmonious situation of Macau”.
Secondly, Sam highlighted the efforts of employees to strengthen “interdepartmental collaboration and cooperation in order to increase executive efficiency” and highlighted the “precise” implementation of government actions.
Sam Hou Fai also referred to “the importance of being more aware of shortcomings” and the need for shortcomings “to be checked as the work is carried out, in order to analyze existing problems and make appropriate improvements”.
Follow the spirit
Regarding the current year, Sam Hou Fai promised that he will continue “to fully implement the spirit of President Xi Jinping's speeches to plan future work”.
The Government leader also called for a single-minded Government, which maximizes the “central role of the Chief Executive”. “All guardianships and services must unify the same thinking, make every effort and collaborate proactively, with a high sense of responsibility and mission and thus create an enormous force to work and advance together, so that, together, they complete this priority task of the Macao SAR government for this year”, he stated. “At the same time, it must urge and improve the predominance of executive power, maximizing the central role of the Chief Executive and the Macao SAR government in the governance system,” he added.
And in this organization centralized around the Chief of Executive, the Legislative Assembly is also included: “The Secretary for Administration and Justice must effectively fulfill her duties and responsibilities, reinforcing coordination and cooperation to ensure that the Macao SAR government assumes its central governance functions with professionalism and pragmatism, in order to create a governance structure with an interconnection between the upper and lower levels and a synergy of cooperation between services, and to promote positive interaction between the executive powers and legislative bodies that cooperate, support and promote reciprocally, at an institutional, political and operational level”, he said.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 13:34:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Suspected of sending drones to North Korea worked in former South leader's office</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/suspeitos-de-enviar-drones-para-coreia-do-norte-trabalhavam-em-gabinete-de-ex-lider-do-sul/</link><description>Two civilians suspected of being involved in recent drone deployments to North Korea worked in former President Yoon Suk-yeol's office, according to an investigation published yesterday by local news agency Yonhap.
The news was released at a time when an investigation is being carried out in Seoul in response to Pyongyang's accusations about the presence of drones in North Korea, in September 2025 and at the beginning of this year.
The first suspect, a man in his 30s, who apparently only worked on manufacturing the drone, was a news supervisor in the presidential spokesperson's office during the Yoon government, according to the agency.
The other suspect, also in his 30s and also working at the presidential complex during the Yoon government, publicly claimed to have operated the drones, in an interview broadcast on Friday by local channel Channel A. The suspect is currently pursuing postgraduate studies in journalism at a private university in Seoul.
The two suspects studied at the same university and founded a drone manufacturing company in 2024, according to Yonhap.
The investigation does not specify the exact years they worked for Yoon, who began his term in May 2022 and ended in April last year, after being removed by the brief declaration of martial law in December 2024.
Yoon Suk-yeol, currently in pre-trial detention, faces charges of abuse of power and other crimes related to the alleged sending of drones to North Korea to disseminate anti-Pyongyang propaganda.
The Public Ministry alleges that the then president ordered the operation to provoke a reaction from the neighboring country and justify the imposition of martial law.
Flights of discord
North Korea accused the South at the UN, in February last year, of sending drones in October 2024 to spread propaganda over the capital Pyongyang.
Yonhap's work also indicates that the first suspect was already interrogated on Friday by the investigation team of the South Korean armed forces and police.
The man was reported to the authorities in November for flying an unregistered drone in the Yeoju area, about 70 kilometers southeast of Seoul, and the model of the device coincided with the one North Korea claims to have shot down in the most recent report.
In an interview with a local channel, the second suspect said that, since September last year, he had carried out several flights over North Korea and that the objective was to measure the levels of radiation and contamination by heavy metals in a uranium factory near the Ryesong River, in North Korean territory.
North Korea reported on January 10 that South Korean drones flew over the territory in September last year and again on January 4 this year.
The government of the current South Korean President, Lee Jae-myung, denied that the drones were military aircraft and began an investigation this week, without ruling out the possibility of civilian involvement.
The North Korean accusation came as a surprise, given that Lee had told the EFE news agency in December that Seoul might have to apologize to Pyongyang for alleged drone flights during Yoon's presidency.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 14:18:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Health | Meeting brings together authorities from Macau, Hong Kong and Mainland China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/saude-reuniao-junta-autoridades-de-macau-hong-kong-e-interior-da-china/</link><description>Last Thursday, the MSAR hosted the 20th Joint Meeting of the Health Administration Summits of Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, where the training of qualified staff, community health and the development of intelligent healthcare were discussed.

Macau has annotated versions of the Civil Code, the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, and between 2006 and 2008, the first two volumes of the annotated and commented Code of Civil Procedure were published, authored by Cândida da Silva Antunes Pires and Viriato de Lima. The work, however, remained unfinished, recalls the lawyer.
Sá Machado, also one of the authors, defends the importance of the project: "We are always using Portuguese codes, Portuguese notes. We are left with something of our own."
Still talking about the work, which will be published in Portugal by Edições Almedina – after making “some approaches in Macau, informally” -, the lawyer says that “I would like it to be a reference work”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Two more shows with Japanese artists canceled</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/cancelados-mais-dois-espectaculos-com-artistas-japoneses/</link><description>The shows by the boy band Nexz, made up of Japanese and Korean artists, were canceled on Friday, without any official explanation, according to a statement from concessionaire Sands China. The two concerts were scheduled for Saturday and Sunday and were sold out.
Initially, the band managed by JYP, one of the main Korean entertainment companies, had only planned one concert in Macau. However, the great demand, as early as December, led to a second show being scheduled the following day.
On Friday, one day before the first concert, the cancellation occurred. “We inform you that the concert “NEXZ SPECIAL CONCERT in MACAO”, originally scheduled for the 17th and 18th of January 2026, has been cancelled”, announced the concessionaire, via social media. “We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding and continued support,” it added.
Shows with the participation of Japanese artists in Macau began to be canceled, after a worsening of diplomatic tensions between Japan and China related to Taiwan.
Cancel culture
The wave of cancellation of shows with Japanese artists in China began in the interior. However, the trend extended to Macau. The first target in Macao was pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki, whose concert, scheduled for January 10th, was canceled on December 9th. Days earlier, on November 29, Hamasaki's concert in Shanghai had also been cancelled.
The cancellations didn't stop there, and at the beginning of the year it was time for Japanese singer Mika Nakashima's concert to be cancelled. At the time, the existence of “unavoidable circumstances” was presented as justification.
The cancellation of shows is not new. In January 2024, pressure from the IC led to the cancellation of the “Made by Beauty” show due to the participation of drag queens. However, IC president Deland Leong denied any involvement in the spate of recent cancellations.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 14:06:11</pubDate></item><item><title>FAM | IC welcomes proposals for new edition of the festival</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/fam-ic-acolhe-propostas-para-nova-edicao-do-festival/</link><description>The Cultural Institute (IC) is welcoming proposals for shows and initiatives that can be integrated into the 36th edition of the Macau Arts Festival (FAM), which takes place between May and June this year. According to a statement, the idea is to provide opportunities for artistic personalities and local organizations.
“Over the years, FAM has sought to encourage the development of local arts and provide a quality platform for the presentation and exchange of performing arts in Macau”, describes the IC in a note.
The aim of FAM is to “expand the exhibition platform for local performing arts and incorporate more creative works with local characteristics”.
For this year's edition, the theme is “Cultural Encounter on the Maritime Silk Road”, inviting participants to “be inspired by Macau's unique cultural heritage”, to present works centered on the territory or “that incorporate specific elements of the city, such as historical architecture, notable figures, places and folk tales, exploring the city's distinct charm”.
Proposals in the competition must fall into two categories, namely “Individual Programs”, which incorporate “all genres of shows, such as theater, Cantonese opera, dance, children's shows and multimedia performing arts”. In this category, the IC encourages “innovation and creative advances in artistic creation”.
In turn, the second category, “Outdoor Showcase” consists of a “popular community program that seeks outdoor performances for the whole family and in a variety of formats”.
The programs selected by IC will receive financial support to cover production costs. Interested local associations and individuals must register by February 10th. Candidates approved in the first selection phase must attend an interview with the jury that same month.</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 02:04:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Thailand | New crane collapse leaves two dead and one injured</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/tailandia-novo-colapso-de-guindaste-faz-dois-mortos-e-um-ferido/</link><description>Two people died and one was injured after a crane fell onto a road on the outskirts of Thailand's capital, a day after a similar incident that killed at least 32 people.
“Two people died and one was injured,” police officer Saranyapong Aonsingh told EFE news agency, adding that security officers were at the scene of the accident, where a viaduct was being built.
According to reports from the Thai rescue and fire services on the social network Facebook, the crane collapsed at around 9:15 am, for reasons still unknown, at a construction site on the Rama II highway, in the province of Samut Sakhon, on the outskirts of Bangkok, hitting two cars.
This accident happened one day after another crane fell on a passenger train, with 171 people on board, in northeastern Thailand, causing at least 32 deaths and more than 50 injuries.
In both cases, the projects were linked to the local company Italian-Thai Development, according to Thai Transport Minister, Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, in a television interview today.
“We don’t know exactly what happened to the company (…). If the situation continues, we may have to announce a temporary stop of all its operations across the country”, he added.</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 02:16:48</pubDate></item><item><title>One Oasis | Request for postponement of entry into force of new law</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/one-oasis-pedido-adiamento-de-entrada-em-vigor-de-nova-lei/</link><description>The One Oasis housing complex condominium will contact the administration to try to postpone the entry into force of the new law that prohibits hiring services from tourism agencies to transport residents of the building. The decision was taken on Friday, after a condominium meeting attended by more than 120 people, including representatives of public transport companies, and the solution aims to buy time to implement other measures.
The controversy over the buildings' shuttle services arose after the Government proposed a law, unanimously approved by the Legislative Assembly last year, which clarified the type of services that can be provided by tourism agencies. As a consequence, the Executive promised a campaign against these agencies when they provide the shuttle bus service to residential buildings. In a statement, the Tourism Services Directorate also indicated that the law does not change anything, and that the ban already existed.
The law change caught many residents off guard. Thursday's One Oasis condominium meeting aimed to seek a solution to the problem. The path thus involves hiring one of the only two companies that can now provide the service. Transmac charges 420 patacas for each bus trip, with a vehicle with 22 seats and 38 standing seats, an average of 7.1 patacas per person. TCM did not present a budget in time for the meeting. However, the condominium considered that it needs more time to apply the new model, and is seeking to obtain a postponement of the entry into force of the new law from the Government.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 13:51:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Paulo Maia and Carmo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Jiang Shinian, also known as Shennong, the «Divine Farmer», patron saint of practitioners of traditional medicine (zhongyi), is also known as Yandi, the «emperor of flames» and is therefore able to control the «flaming wind», the excess heat that causes symptoms such as tremors, confusion or sudden fever.

Simone Weil was born in Paris on February 3, 1909 and died on August 24, 1943, she lived little and intensely in a troubled time, crossed by two major world wars, the first between 1914 and 1918, and the second, between 1939 and 1945, particularly marked in her life. She was an outstanding French philosopher, of Jewish origin, teacher, politician and activist. Then he turned to mystical thought, leaving us with profound reflections on his relationship with God. He died at the age of 34 of heart failure while almost fasting, restricting his diet to a minimum, it is said, in a possible reading, by an occupied France in a gesture of solidarity with his compatriots who lived poorly and under the tutelage of the Nazis, while he was working for the French government in exile in Great Britain.
He learned ancient Greek to speak in code with his older brother, mathematician André Weil, so that his parents could not understand them. Later he began studying Sanskrit, in order to be able to read Bhagavad Gita in the original and, at the time of his revolutionary furor, he was also a pacifist and trade unionist, concentrating his activity on literature classes for the working classes, as he considered that French literature was the right way to educate the workers' spirit and revolution in accordance with their cultural tradition.
Later she visited anarchic thought, maintaining her pacifist vocation until she was confronted with the Nazi regime and the occupation of France. He reacted by joining the French Resistance, but he felt a strong spiritual call, so along with political activism, he developed a deep mysticism, despite having grown up in an agnostic environment.
The call to the Christian faith began in 1935, in Portugal, having been touched by the beauty of our churches, while on vacation in Póvoa do Varzim. Later, in 1937, he felt religious ecstasy in Assisi in the small Romanesque chapel of Santa Maria degli Angeli, where Saint Francis used to pray. However, it is necessary to keep in mind that she was interested in several religious traditions that included the Greek and Egyptian mysteries, Hinduism, Mahayana Buddhism, among the religious experiences that culminated in her relationship not with Catholicism, but with Christianity, without ever advocating any type of religious syncretism.
Let's move on to the presentation of the second thinker in this article, Byung-Chul Han, one of the best-known South Korean thinkers in the West, born in Seoul in 1959. He studied Metallurgy, later living in Germany, where he studied Philosophy at the University of Freiburg and German Literature and Theology at the University of Munich, currently teaching Philosophy at the University of Arts in Berlin. The philosopher brings us Conversations about God – A Dialogue with Simone Weil, in a 2025 publication, very well translated by Ana Falcão Bastos in Relógio D´Água Editores.
His conversation with the philosopher Simone Weil develops around a reflection on God, combining his readings and interpretation of her thoughts, with him strongly heir to the Eastern immanentist tradition, which is why in the last chapter, entitled Inactivity, he fervently states: "Simone Weil imagines a kind of panpsychism. Everything is alive and animated. Without the spirituality of the universe, no relationship between it and the human spirit is possible" (Han, 2025, 81).
According to his perspective, which he always believes he shares with Simone Weil, in order to talk to God an appropriate ethical stance is necessary, analyzed in the seven chapters into which he divides the work. It is then necessary to cultivate and accept Attention, Uncreation, Emptiness, Silence, Beauty, Pain and Inactivity. These are the right inner and outer ingredients to maintain a close relationship with God, who is not dead, as Nietzsche proclaimed, but rather very present to a humanity that does not seem to be capable of listening to or contemplating him. “It is not God who is dead, but the man to whom God revealed himself” (Han, 2025, 11), so we must cultivate the attention of the spirit, turn it towards God and this is done first and foremost with the teachings of Simone Weil: she died from the heart, in an exhausted, tubercular and bloodless body, or out of solidarity, or out of the belief that the less she ate, the more and better she would achieve union with God. Note the following reflection: "Two birds, inseparable companions, perch on the same tree. One eats the fruit from the tree, the other watches without eating." (Weil apud Han, 2025, 11).
The world, according to both thinkers, is full of information, programs, and wrong attitudes, for example, binge watching, which means “devouring television programs”, in addition to all types of distractions, entertainment and food. Thus, it is advocated in the Buddhist or Taoist way, that it is necessary to be frugal, in a literal and metaphorical sense, to fast so that the soul triggers a process of “autophagy” leading to God, because “Only this autophagy of the soul saves and leads to God.” (Han, 2025, 12). In this way, the organism will eat its own meat, transforming it into energy. This practical philosophy taken to its ultimate consequences implies death, as happened to Simone Weil, when already very weakened, she saw her heart giving of itself.
There is, however, a middle ground, which will need to be taken into account to develop the spirit's attention, as the spirit immersed in the flesh becomes incapable of concentrating. If absolute fasting is dangerous, as the Historical Buddha discovered sitting under the Ficus Religiosa, relative fasting, or rather dietary simplicity, can stimulate “contemplative attention” essential to seeing God. This vision requires deep attention, which can be used to solve a scientific or artistic problem, as in the God vision, because “God is attention without distraction” (Han, 2025, 14).
Attention will thus be exercised in total concentration, similar to that used in prayer, in connection with the sacred, which is at the same time the supreme good, recalling the two forces of love and hate of the pre-Socratic philosopher Empedocles. These operate in the cosmos, making it organized, connected, attentive and loving, or disconnected, distracted and hateful. "Good unites and reconciles, while evil separates and divides. Evil is multifaceted. Good, on the contrary, is based on a single truth." (Han, 2025, 17). It is therefore natural to promote, within the framework of both thinkers, an “ethics of attention” or an ethics of mercy/compassion (Han, 2025,74), as only through this can a connection be achieved with others and, above all, with the Other, in an empathetic, spontaneous and deep connection.
The way Byung-Chul Han defines Christian virtue is very interesting: “Christian virtue is not a search, it is not an action, but rather a waiting and observing (…) the role of the future wife is to wait” (Han, 2025, 18). I believe that, although it is an authorized reading of this virtue, the emphasis given to contemplative attention and waiting finds its reason for being within many Asian philosophies, which privilege non-action and even inactivity, as occurs in the seventh chapter of the work, being described in terms of the correct way of contact with the sacred, in an obedient, humble and silent posture. The author tells us, excluding the will, as much as possible: “It is inactivity that gives wings to the soul” (Han, 2025, 19) Perhaps for this reason, the first etymological definition of religion offered in the text refers to attention and the term religo means “relegere (reread)” (Han, 2025, 20). First of all, you need to know how to read the signs and pray or, in a more Eastern nomenclature, meditate. And continuing along this line that crosses East and West, to properly cultivate attention it is necessary to “empty” the soul to prepare it for connection to the sacred, which will allow us to introduce, in the last chapter, the second most common etymological definition in the West, “Religion as religare, means to connect, bind or unite” (Han, 2025,84) in a “reconnecting” what has been disconnected, the sacred and the profane in the style of Taoist and Buddhist philosophies.
In this logic of thought of the South Korean philosopher, who talks to the French philosopher, emptiness is fundamental, not to give encouragement to life, as stated in the fourth chapter of the Book of Way and Virtue (《道德经》), and remember: “the Tao is an empty vessel/it is used and never becomes full./unfathomable source of ten thousand things” (道冲而用之或不盈/渊兮似万物之宗)(Abreu, 2013,34-5), but, more in a Buddhist or Platonic way, to favor death. Cultivating emptiness is learning to be nothing, to uncreate oneself or lose the self, to renounce: “Empty means, ultimately, learning to die, surrendering oneself to death: «Praying is like death»” (Han, 2025,51).
This reading, which is very indebted to Eastern tradition, is contrasted with an active Western Christian virtue, which finds God not in contemplative attention, although one can also be present there, but in active life, in relationships with others in the exercise of compassion or permanent love so that the kingdom of God descends as much as possible to earth. The definition of love advanced by Han, through Weil, is that of a “gaze of the soul”, that is, “love is based on the look as the attention of the soul.” (Han, 2025, 22). The cultivation of contemplation, waiting, silence and emptiness can lead to the presence of God, being a possible reading of the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus teaches that the lilies of the field and the birds of Heaven do not need to work or spin, God offers life as a gift and divine grace.
However, if being is nothing, if obedience, silence and renunciation can lead to a theodynamics of love, care and attention must be taken that this is directed and concentrated on the relationship with God, because in human society an overwhelming thermodynamic of power dominates and according to the Western tradition we cannot run the risk of falling into the trap of power, because, as the author clearly sees, although he does not draw the ultimate consequences of what he writes: “Whoever has power has the feeling that they are growing spatially. It expands or extends. The increase in power manifests itself with an increase in the self” (Han, 2025, 42). The “re-connected” being will have to distinguish very carefully between the sacred and the profane, ensuring that their connection is true, or otherwise they will become a silent and renouncing nothing before their fellow man, which is absolutely intolerable for all the children of the same Father, as well as for the heirs of the Western philosophical tradition.
Obviously, it is not advocating a thermodynamic power relationship, that is, full of energy and always expanding, that the author has in mind. Therefore, from a concrete and human point of view, it advises work relationships outside the master/slave connection, so denounced by Nietzsche in his attack on the Christian religion.
In the mundane sphere, Han proposes that we escape either the labor relations created by industrial capitalist societies, in which “human beings are trained to become mechanical labor cattle” (Han, 2025,78), or by neoliberal performance societies in which people believe they are authentic and creative, but in reality embark on a productive frenzy in which they become “slaves of themselves” (Ibidem).
So what seems to be the best solution for human beings in a world where work is fundamental? I confess that the author's response surprised and captivated me. The solution is to make work a loving theodynamic process, that is, not to carry it out without meaning, but to dedicate your actions to God, which for a Christian means, working out of love for others, carrying out a symbolic act, in the etymological sense of the term, as union and yet another way of penetrating the sacred sphere. Therefore, labor is poeticized, making it creative, in the manner of Simone Weil or Byung-Chul Han: "It is, therefore, about giving work a contemplative and spiritual character. Elevating it "to the highest point, that of the fullness of attention, which is the fullness of prayer." (Han, 2025, 85)

Macau has annotated versions of the Civil Code, the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, and between 2006 and 2008, the first two volumes of the annotated and commented Code of Civil Procedure were published, authored by Cândida da Silva Antunes Pires and Viriato de Lima. The work, however, remained unfinished, recalls the lawyer.
Sá Machado, also one of the authors, defends the importance of the project: "We are always using Portuguese codes, Portuguese notes. We are left with something of our own."
Still talking about the work, which will be published in Portugal by Edições Almedina – after making “some approaches in Macau, informally” -, the lawyer says that “I would like it to be a reference work”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Study | Hong Kong society dominates depression news</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/14/estudo-sociedade-de-hong-kong-domina-noticias-sobre-depressao/</link><description>A study published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research analyzed the themes and emotional tone of news stories about depression published in Hong Kong. The “societal system”, related to health, family or work, comes first with 34.83 percent of total news, having a “more negative inclination”
The Hong Kong society system dominates the group of topics present in news about depression, representing 34.83 percent of the articles analyzed, followed by topics such as law enforcement, with 18.81 percent, or the global economic recession in third place.
This is the main conclusion of the study “Analyzing Themes, Feelings, and Coping Strategies Regarding Online News Coverage of Depression in Hong Kong: Mixed Methods Study”, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research last year. The study was authored by Chen Sihui, Cindy Sing and Yangna Hu, from Hong Kong Polytechnic University; and Cecília Cheng, from the University of Hong Kong.
The study is focused on online news coverage about depression in the neighboring region, namely from publications such as the South China Morning Post and Hong Kong Free Press, and sought to understand the dominant themes and the emotional charge of the texts, whether they were positive or negative, among other issues.
Thus, the study reveals that the region's “societal system” was at the origin of 34.83 percent of news about depression, that is, 848 out of a total of 2,435, followed by the theme of “law enforcement”, representing 458 of all news analyzed, with a share of 18.81 percent. This is followed, in third place, by the theme of “global recession”, with 17.4 percent of responses; “lifestyle”, with 8.05 percent; “leisure”, with 11.21 percent of responses; “health issues”, with 6.94 percent and, finally, “United States politics”, representing just 3.12 percent of the news.
The study therefore describes that analyzing the sentiment inherent to the news, “it becomes evident that the societal system presented a more negative inclination”, being “related to several systems of Hong Kong society, including health, social, family, education and work”.
Between extradition and covid-19
The collection of online news was carried out between February 2019 and May 2024 “with the aim of examining the most recent representation of depression, especially during and after the period of social unrest and the covid-19 pandemic”.
The articles were chosen based on three criteria, one of which was accessibility to readers without a paid subscription, in addition to the fact that the website in question “should allow the retrieval of a sufficient quantity of depression-related news (i.e., more than 20) to ensure adequate data for subsequent analyses.” Websites with news in English were also chosen. Then, separate searches were carried out using the keywords “depression” and “depressed”.
The dates chosen for this study relate to two events. One of them was in February 2019, with the introduction of the proposed law on extradition to China, entitled “Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment)”. This “triggered protests and marches in Hong Kong due to political differences, leading to a significant increase in cases of depression, worsened in 2020 with the outbreak of Covid-19”.
The authors reveal that there were “peaks in coverage” of news related to depression, namely in April and May 2020 and in July 2023. Covid-19 followed as a second occurrence.
In the case of news from 2020, the study finds that “confinement measures due to covid-19 strongly affected Hong Kong, contributing to a more depressive mood”, and this period “corresponded to the second wave of the covid-19 outbreak”. The second pandemic wave led to strong confinement measures such as the closure of schools, “remote work policies and the ban on in-person meals in restaurants”.
The closure of schools, “as reported in the news, resulted in increased rates of depression among children and anxiety among parents, who had to simultaneously care for their children and elderly people at home.”
“In addition, conflicts between work and family also intensified due to the interruption of the normal work routine”, namely “the absence of office space and unclear working hours”, which “was associated with depressive feelings”, it is described.
In turn, in 2023 there was an “increase in reported suicide cases”, especially because Coco Lee, “an influential star who faced depression, died by suicide at home, which generated greater awareness about the need to expand support services in the area of ​​mental health and improve accessibility, with helplines frequently being highlighted”.
A certain stigma
With regard to the second most common topic found in the news, “law enforcement”, the study highlights that it also causes “a negative feeling”. “The volume of news reached peaks in November 2020 and August 2019”, and in 2020, “individual crimes and legal proceedings were mainly reported, with emphasis on the case of a Hong Kong teacher who murdered his wife, which may have caused a great social shock and public attention”.
The authors explain that, in this case, “depression was frequently cited in the news as an explanation for the perpetrator's illegal actions, which can reinforce stigmatizing attitudes and portray people with depression as violent, dangerous and more likely to commit crimes”.
Other topics that also showed “negative trends” are “health issues” and “United States politics”, with topics such as “lifestyle” or “leisure” “tending towards more positive feelings”.
With regard to another theme associated with news about depression, that of the “global recession”, the focus is the “economic difficulties caused by the spread of covid-19 in different sectors”, presenting “a more contradictory positive feeling”. In other words, “the structure of the reports initially described the economic challenges, to then emphasize the initiatives to facilitate recovery in response to the crisis”.
Thus, the authors note that “a significant change in general sentiment was observed”, as “until January 2021, the continuous decrease in the amount of positive news was interrupted”, and that afterwards “the aggregate number of positive news exceeded that of negative news almost every month, signaling a general change from a negative feeling to a more positive feeling in relation to the economic circumstances discussed”.
The authors consider that the change may be due “to the fact that people have been forced to adapt to a ‘new normal’ and begin the recovery of the economy, health, and society after a year of living with the pandemic”. Regarding the theme of US politics found in news associated with depression, the texts “emphasized rivalry and the presidential electoral process, as well as politicians from different parties who experienced depression”.
Few institutional responses
The study also looked at so-called coping strategies, that is, cognitive or behavioral efforts used to deal with less good situations. And here, the news analyzed focused mainly on “information about skills and resources” available to help people with depression, such as “support lines for suicidal intentions and suicide prevention”. Mental health programs provided by local organizations were also presented, such as Mind HK, the Kely Support Group and the Mental Health Association of Hong Kong, and articles were written about “counseling services and therapies for people with depression”, or even physical exercise recommendations.
The authors highlight that, when analyzing the news, they noticed “the insufficiency of political interventions, institutional support and financial assistance for individuals with depression, which indicates a deficiency at the societal level of coping strategies and which are present in journalistic coverage”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 02:06:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Higher education | Academic highlights growth of the sector in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/13/ensino-superior-academico-destaca-crescimento-do-sector-em-macau/</link><description>In “Macau, networks, dialogues and affections – The consolidation of the Portuguese-speaking community of China studies”, academic Pedro Steenhagen argues that Macau is taking great strides to be a bridge at an academic level with Portuguese-speaking countries, despite “still having a long way to go to achieve its goals”
The article “Macau, networks, dialogues and affections – The consolidation of the Portuguese-speaking community of China studies”, written by academic and doctoral student Pedro Steenhagen, has just been published in Revista Sinóptica, an editorial project of the Observa China portal. The article highlights the role that the Macao SAR can play in connecting its higher education system with Portuguese-speaking countries, and the growing importance it has had in this area.
“The aforementioned efforts in the field of education are not just rhetorical”, he described in the article, noting that “in relatively few decades, the Asian nation has become a true power in the area”. Pedro Steenhagen is based on two world rankings to assess the quality of higher education in the world, namely the World University Rankings 2026 by Times Higher Education (from 2025), which shows how “Macau, a small special administrative region in China, has three ranked universities: University of Macau (145), University of Science and Technology of Macau (251-300) and University of the City of Macau (601-800)”, these data being related to positions occupied in the ranking.
“Very interestingly, MSAR universities have experienced tremendous growth; for example, the University of Macau has seen a jump of more than 250 positions in the ranking in the last 10 years”, highlights the author of the article. In his view, these data translate into the fact that Macao SAR “assumes an increasingly relevant leadership role in the area of ​​education and research”.
Furthermore, it has “the best university in the Portuguese-speaking world in its territory, is experiencing an intense expansion of the education and research sector and serves as a fundamental axis for the exchange of people and the promotion of knowledge”.
Taking the rankings into account, Pedro Steenhagen's article recalls that China “has five [universities] in the top 50 in the world: Tsinghua University (12), Beijing University (13), Fudan University (36), Zhejiang University (39) and Shanghai Jiaotong University (40)”, with the Times Higher Education ranking “showing a total of 97 results for mainland China”.
Brazil, as “the largest Portuguese-speaking country on the globe, has a total of 59 results, and its five best universities are: University of São Paulo (201-250), State University of Campinas (351-400), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (601-800), Universidade Estadual Paulista (601-800) and Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (601-800)”.
In the case of Portugal, there are 16 results, with the five best higher education establishments being the University of Coimbra, University of Lisbon, University of Porto, Universidade Nova de Lisboa and ISCTE-Instituto Universitário de Lisboa.
Looking at the remaining Portuguese-speaking countries, Pedro Steenhagen highlights how “Mozambique has only one presence in the ranking”, with Eduardo Mondlane University, while “no other Portuguese-speaking country has ranked universities”.
A long way
Despite the good results, Pedro Steenhagen points out that “the Macao SAR still has a long way to go to achieve all its goals”. However, “its enormous potential as a regional and global protagonist in areas such as technology and innovation, sustainable tourism, creative industry, finance and, particularly, teaching, research and people exchange is already quite clear”.
The academic article refers to the “Lusophony component and the unique connection with the PLPs [Portuguese-speaking countries] which adds even more dynamism to its ambitions and to a trajectory that can already be considered incredibly successful since its retrocession”, that is, the transition of the Portuguese administration of Macau to China, in 1999.
In the case of the University of Macau (UM), the first to emerge in Macau, and which is now celebrating 45 years of existence, “it has the largest Portuguese department in Asia”, it is highlighted in the article, in addition to having “two research centers: the Research Center for Portuguese-Asian Studies and the Chinese-Portuguese Bilingual Teaching and Training Center”, with “its growing internationalization movement being notable”.
Pedro Steenhagen counts the “student exchange programs with more than 10 Brazilian universities”, in addition to the strengthening of “collaboration in teaching and research via international alliances, such as the Association of Portuguese Language Universities, and the establishment of the Center for Judicial and Legal Studies of China and Portuguese-speaking Countries”.
The example of the City University of Macau (UCM) is mentioned, where the Institute for Research on Portuguese-Speaking Countries is established, with “unique programs” of master's and doctoral degrees in Studies of Portuguese-Speaking Countries.
By establishing partnerships with ISCTE-IUL, UCM is in a “position at the forefront of academic programs and initiatives that go beyond purely linguistic and cultural issues” in connection with Portuguese-speaking countries.
There is also the example of a private higher education institution, the University of São José, which “signed [agreements], for example, with the Federal University of Ceará and the Portuguese Catholic University, not only to bring closer relations on a bilateral basis, but also to promote joint projects”.
The place of the Government
Pedro Steenhagen also refers to the intervention of the Macao SAR Government in connecting with the Portuguese-speaking world, namely the Directorate of Economic and Technological Development Services and the Macau Business Incubation Center for Young People, which have held the Macau Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition for Technology Companies from Brazil and Portugal since 2021.
Of note is the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in Lisbon and the Macau Houses spread around the world which, “together with international initiatives such as the Meeting of Macanese Communities, contribute not only to the vitality of intellectual exchanges, but also to the cultivation of memory and affective ties between Macau, the diaspora, descendants and Portuguese-speaking communities”.
“Associations such as the Association of Brazilian Studies in Macau and the Industrial and Commercial Association of Macau offer substance, in a complementary way to universities and research institutes, for strengthening relationships, developing networks and generating increasingly fruitful dialogues between the parties involved”, it further reads.
Pedro Steenhagen is a doctoral candidate in the field of International Politics at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs at Fudan University, and president of the Brazilian Citizens' Council in Shanghai. On the Observa China platform, he is development director and coordinator of the China-Brazil and Lusofonia Relations Center. The platform is a think-tank created in 2020 by “a group of young professionals and students with the mission of creating a network to qualify the debate on China in Portuguese”, reads the website.</description><pubDate>2026-01-13 01:02:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Book | Changes in Portuguese colonial policy at the end of the 19th century</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/12/livro-as-mudancas-na-politica-colonial-portuguesa-nos-finais-do-seculo-xix/</link><description>Defended in 2018, the doctoral thesis by Célia Reis, professor and researcher in contemporary History, has just been published in a book by the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center with the support of the Macau Foundation. “The Power between Lisbon and the East – Persistences and Changes in Administration. From the Ultimatum to the Colonial Act” circulates between Macau, India and Timor and brings “a good contribution to the history of colonial power”
Célia Reis, professor and researcher in the area of ​​Contemporary History at Universidade Nova de Lisboa, has just published her doctoral thesis in a book focused on Portuguese colonial power in the East from the end of the 19th century. “Power between Lisbon and the East – Persistences and Changes in Administration. From the Ultimatum to the Colonial Act” is an edition of the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM), supported by the Macau Foundation (FM), and arises from the thesis defended in 2018.
To HM, Célia Reis argued that this book and its research bring “a good contribution to the history of colonial power”, focusing “on the administrative configurations in the colonies of the East, India, Macau and Timor, in the period between the Ultimatum and the Colonial Act”, published in 1930.
“Thousands of documents” were analyzed, namely “formal letters, private letters, reports from departments, drafts, small notes” that demonstrate decisions and the functioning of the Administration in the territories of Portuguese India, Macau and Timor.
We speak, according to the author, of “a time of many experiments, in different phases”, and, for Célia Reis, “a gap that existed in Portuguese historiography” was overcome in the sense of a better understanding of the functioning of Portuguese colonial power in these years, and specifically in the territories to the East.
In the case of Macau, the book and study contribute “to an administrative history of the period in question”, namely “why it was decided, how it was decided; what problems were posed at an administrative level; how the power of Lisbon was felt and how it was resolved, or how it sought to influence the central power; or who represented it”.
The territory is also placed “alongside two other spaces, India and Timor, which are very different, enabling a comparative history, an emphasis on what was common or specific, which, without a doubt, is essential for deeper knowledge”.  Célia Reis says she is “very happy with the publication”, for being able to “share the work, investigations and their results, with the public, helping to better understand the history and lived realities”.
Historical adjustments
The years dedicated to this research show many changes in colonial policy, taking into account that “the colonization movement seen from the last decades of the 19th century was reflected in the way of governing the colonies, giving rise to discussions, studies and adaptations to realities”.
Célia Reis further explained that “the existing framework, which had been institutionalized since 1869, was being altered by the creation of new departments, the introduction of new forms of financial control or the change in the status and organization of some colonies, making the administration less homogeneous than was seen in many speeches”.
At issue is, in particular, a decree dated December 1, 1869, which proved to be the “true organic charter of the Overseas Provinces”, as stated in the conclusion of the work, without forgetting the Administrative Code of 1842, which “shaped the overseas political bodies for decades”.
“Although they lead to a continuous model, in the bodies and their functions, they did not prevent the progressive organization of new configurations or the adaptation of different structures”, we also read.
The researcher highlights the occurrence of successive attempts at modernization in legislative and administrative terms, even before the implementation of the First Republic. “Several proposals for modifications were made, with a more modernizing intention, and which had greater emphasis from the last years of the Monarchy, continuing later through the Republic for a more structured change, which ended up being carried out by laws published in 1914 and 1920”.
From October 5, 1910, when the Monarchy fell and a republican regime was established, there was “a ministerial change, with the assumption of reference to colonies replacing Ultramar and the autonomy of its ministry”.
"In overseas areas, the change of regime was understood as an opportunity for administrative renewal, as can be understood by India's proposal, or by the openness expressed by government bodies to changes in Macau. But the new republican regime remained, in the field of colonial administration, trapped in the circumstances of its beginning, by constitutionalizing it.
In fact, in the wide range of changes, colonial issues constituted only one part and parliamentarians did not dedicate themselves sufficiently to them, despite the existence of proposals”, reads the conclusion of the work.
In the years of Republicanism, there was “political processing that imposed a framework of parliamentarism, due to some distrust towards the Executive”, and at the level of the colonies “this option led to greater interference by the Senate in the appointment of governors, moving away from what were considered more effective models”.
Furthermore, “the rupture also did not take place in the field of participation in Congress, where overseas territories maintained their space in the political game”. "The republican decision also showed a conservative nature in relation to municipal bodies. As it was not possible to carry out a more in-depth study here, it was found that the political vision based on the importance of the municipality, as a space for participation, prevented the deeper changes that were proposed for the internal organization", is mentioned in the conclusion.
Barriers and control
“Obstacles occurred, such as Sidonism”, followed, with attempts at change being found to be “insufficient”. It should be noted that Sidonism had its origins in a military coup carried out by Sidónio Pais against the republican regime in force in those years, since 1910, and which operated between 1917 and 1918. It was an authoritarian and militaristic regime.
According to Célia Reis, it was after the Military Dictatorship of 1926 that “we moved towards greater control” in terms of colonial policy.
In general terms, “the regime that began on October 5th was, in short, modernizing in some sense, but its political conceptions and the insertion of colonial issues in the broader space of changes to be carried out in the country allowed the persistence of many previous modes”.
“Despite these limitations, the 1914 laws undoubtedly constituted a modernizing step, replacing the existing framework”, concluded Célia Reis, referring to the years of Sidonism as “a rupture in the path that was being followed, with the retreat of colonial capabilities, particularly collegiate bodies and local participation, as well as a decrease in financial autonomy”. This “political trend” experienced in the then metropolis ended up “transplanted overseas”.
In terms of documentation used in this investigation, we have the example of the Organic Charters, implemented by Portugal for each colony, and which “arose following the laws of 1914”, analyzing “the various proposals existing in India, Macau and Timor, their implementation process, the essential characteristics of those that belonged to those colonies and their subsequent trajectory”.
According to the investigation, “they were the product of the moment in which they took place, inserted in a broader change introduced in Portugal by the Republic, which conditioned their existence, firstly due to the different contributions they had and, later, due to the lack of definition of their situation”.
This study analyzes “the way in which central and colonial decisions were operationalized”, having considered “governmental and parliamentary structures”. In the case of colonies, “their organs of power” were studied, where “the governor, interlocutor between metropolis and colony, acted, examining his capabilities and possibility of action, when he was under the authority of a distant ministry, but alongside other supervisory powers, particularly financial, Councils and, in general, under pressure from the various forces of the colony”.
In the case of the “competences and composition of the various Councils and means of financial control” they have experienced, in these years, “a change, much more pronounced throughout the various reforms; mainly integrating civil servants”. Furthermore, “the combination of other elements of local society proved to be different, depending on the colonies”.
Orders of Lisbon
Célia Reis describes that “local deliberations were dependent on superior sanction and remained so beyond the reforms”, and “the practice often circumvented the norm, maintaining uncertainty as a form of action”.
Another point to highlight in this study is how the fact that Lisbon made the most important decisions affected life in the colonies.
"Although the mandatory sanction remained, the legislation introduced changes, mainly based on the establishment of deadlines. Nevertheless, the metropolitan decision-making capacity remained essential, affecting the life of the colonies. The forms used, persisting what existed or changing the framework, essentially constituted adaptations to the circumstances that occurred, responding both to foreign models and to the needs imposed on Portuguese realities. Politics, in its instability and phases of change, also determined this path", he said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Elections | Portugal prepares to choose the next President of the Republic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/eleicoes-portugal-prepara-se-para-escolher-o-proximo-presidente-da-republica/</link><description>Portugal goes to the vote on Sunday to choose the next President of the Republic. Of the 11 candidates, only two have representatives from Macau: Bessa Almeida from the PSD, and Neto Valente from the PS. The former president of the Macau Lawyers Association highlights that António José Seguro “does not join in provocations against China”, while Bessa Almeida considers that Marques Mendes is the right man for the moment


 
Eleven candidates will vote on Sunday to choose the next President of the Portuguese Republic, for a five-year term. This is a record number, with only seven having the support of political parties. Running for the position is Luís Marques Mendes, supported by the Social Democratic Party (PSD), and who appointed António Bessa Almeida as his representative in the Macao SAR. Next comes António José Seguro, with the support of the Socialist Party (PS), which has Jorge Neto Valente, president of the Macau Portuguese School Foundation and lawyer, as his representative. They are the only candidates for the Presidency of the Republic who chose figures as representatives of the Macao SAR.
The remaining candidates are Henrique Gouveia e Melo, João Cotrim de Figueiredo, Catarina Martins, António Filipe, André Ventura Jorge Pinto, Manuel João Vieira, André Pestana and Humberto Correia.
To HM, António Bessa Almeida, PSD activist and explained the reasons for supporting Marques Mendes. “At the time Portugal is going through, the country needs a candidate like Marques Mendes, who has a deep understanding of the different policies”, he began by pointing out.
Asked about the type of actions developed in Macau to attract the electorate to vote for Marques Mendes, Bessa Almeida simply mentioned that “the campaign in Macau is totally different from that in Portugal”, and the actions developed involve “what the candidate does in close proximity to the people, passing on information”.
For Bessa Almeida, “the electorate in Macau, on the Chinese side, is also made up of Portuguese”, and that “they have been following these elections like any other Portuguese, with confident visions for the future of Portugal”.
On January 6th, the president released a note highlighting the importance of Marques Mendes' candidacy, who is currently far from the top spots in the polls. "We have always been concerned with everything related to Portugal and at this moment, at a global level, political changes are sudden and unexpected. That is why we need a visionary president, experienced and thoughtful in guiding the destinies of Portugal and Portuguese people born and living outside the country."
 
A safe return
In Portugal, polls relating to the presidential elections have taken place almost daily, and show a change in the choice of candidates. If initially António José Seguro was somewhat removed from the top positions, a survey carried out by the Universidade Católica Portuguesa for RTP, Antena 1 and the Público newspaper, between the 6th and 9th of January and released this week, shows how Seguro is in a technical tie with André Ventura, Chega's candidate, guaranteeing 23 percent of voting intentions, when Ventura collects 24 percent. João Cotrim de Figueiredo comes in third place, with 19 percent, with the possibility of going to the second round of elections, followed by Marques Mendes and Gouveia e Melo with 14 percent.
Another survey, this time for TVI, CNN, TSF and Jornal de Notícias, with data collected on the 10th, 11th and 12th of January, shows Seguro with 23.9 percent of voting intentions, followed by Cotrim de Figueiredo with 20.8 percent and Ventura with 20.5 percent. Marques Mendes falls to fifth place, with 13.2 percent.
Seguro chose, in the Macao SAR, Jorge Neto Valente as his agent, who did not answer HM's call. In a statement published in the newspapers this Wednesday, the former president of the Macau Lawyers Association declared that Seguro “proposes a vision of the future based on the modernization of the country, the valorization of education and a commitment to innovation”. Referring specifically to Portugal-China relations, Neto Valente highlights that “unlike other candidates, Seguro does not support China's provocations regarding the status of Taiwan, and is also a candidate who “knows Portugal, Europe and the world”.
Neto Valente also stated that Seguro “is a decent man”. “He participated in all debates, showed politeness, defended his ideas firmly, was never excessive in his language and, unlike others, did not insult opponents or make malicious insinuations toward them.”
 
A “consistent route”
Paulo Pisco, leader of the Insurance campaign for emigration, reminded HM that the candidate “even expressed the opinion that, given that it was an in-person vote [for the presidential elections], the Government could have done much more, namely complying with what the electoral law for the Presidency of the Republic says, which is the possibility of opening more polling stations”.
Seguro also defended, according to Paulo Pisco, “that mobility voting could also have been applied, based on the experience previously carried out in the last elections for the European Parliament”.
Paulo Pisco states that António José Seguro has followed a “very consistent, solid and objective path”, which has allowed him to reach the top of the polls. Regarding the emigrated electorate, the deputy highlights that Seguro “has not deviated from the purposes, form and values ​​with which he intends to exercise the Presidency of the Republic”.
Furthermore, it is “a guarantor of the stability of the political system and also of democracy”. “This image that the candidate António José Seguro has shown throughout his career has earned him greater receptivity from voters”, highlighted Paulo Pisco.
The president does not forget that “Seguro is the candidate who has the most representatives per country in our diaspora”. "There are 18, ten in Europe and eight outside Europe. I believe that this substantiates a very firm commitment from the candidate to the exercise of his functions as President of the Republic, and to the relationship he intends to have with the diaspora", he stressed.
Looking at the candidates lower down in the polls, we have many faces from the left. The same survey with data collected on the 10th, 11th and 12th of January places Catarina Martins, from Bloco de Esquerda, with 2.5 percent; followed by António Filipe, from PCP, with 1.4 percent, head to head with Jorge Pinto, from Livre, who has 1.3 percent. Manuel João Vieira, visual artist and musician, obtains 1 percent of voting intentions.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>University of Macau | Former teachers recall experiences</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/09/universidade-de-macau-antigos-docentes-recordam-experiencias/</link><description>The University of Macau celebrates 45 years and HM invited two former professors to recall their professional experiences at the institution. Brian Hall, from the field of psychology, found “the ideal environment” to start his career. Vera Lúcia Raposo says she “learned a lot” and saw Law as a “meeting place”
A series of events begins this Sunday to celebrate the 45 years of existence of the University of Macau (UM), including the “Open Day” which takes place at the Lakeside Theater between 11am and 5pm (see secondary text). It was in March 1981, still under the name of the University of East Asia, that UM began to take its first steps in local higher education, namely in the teaching of Law in the Portuguese language.
It was the first time that Macau had its own university, providing a higher education offering for residents, who no longer only had the opportunity to pursue studies abroad, such as Portugal, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong or Australia.
To commemorate the anniversary, HM invited two former professors of the institution, from two different academic areas, to talk about their experience at UM.
Vera Lúcia Raposo, who taught at the Faculty of Law from January 2014, remembers feeling “a shock”. "The classes were entirely in English, and I had never taught a complete course in that language, the pressure to publish in indexed journals was absolute and the evaluation system was periodic, demanding and relentless. Nothing there resembled the regime I was used to, where the simple passage of time often seemed to guarantee the natural advancement of an academic career", she said.
However, adaptation arrived and ended up following “the rules” to this day, namely at NOVA School of Law. “At the time, however, these requirements were still profoundly strange in Portugal, and they continue to be so, in many contexts, even today”, he says.
Vera Lúcia Raposo says she “learned a lot” at UM, as “the demanding scientific production goals and interdisciplinary research contributed to defining the type of academic I am today”. “I owe UM more than a professional transition, but a transformation”, he assures.
A cultural melting pot
The former professor at the UM Faculty of Law also remembers arriving in a territory that was “a space of true cultural amalgamation”, with the institution being an example of this.
"Working side by side with colleagues of different nationalities and cultures was a rare privilege. In particular, the intellectual coexistence between Chinese, Macanese and Portuguese colleagues, in the study and teaching of Macau Law, offered me an absolutely unique way of thinking about Law: less self-centered, more dialoguing, more aware of its cultural and historical contingency", highlighted Vera Lúcia Raposo.
Brian Hall, who taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and coordinated the “Global and Community Mental Health Research Group”, highlights the possibility of doing pioneering work in the area of ​​mental health. "UM gave me the opportunity to develop unique and never-before-taught courses in Global Mental Health and Global Health. They were the first courses of their kind in Macau and at the university", recalled Brian Hall, who is now linked to New York University Shanghai.
“I was grateful to have some really great students who were interested in topics like migration, global and digital mental health, and I really enjoyed mentoring them in and out of the classroom.”
The first prizes
The academic also highlights the fact that he “regularly published research articles with undergraduate and postgraduate students, taking them to international research conferences, where they won awards”. “We were among the first at the university to achieve these excellent results and I am eternally grateful to UM for providing me with all these opportunities”, he confessed.
Brian Hall also added that he joined UM “in a period of ambitious transition and growth to become a research university”, providing “an ideal environment to launch a career”. When he was at UM, Brian Hall received, in 2020, an award for his work, the “Excellence in Advising Award” from the Center for Global Health at Johns Hopkins University, from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
"The university rewarded me for my excellent research performance by granting me permission to apply for an early promotion to associate professor, which I was granted just four years after joining the university. UM served as a springboard to build a regional and international career," he said.
Book of Genesis
The need to create a university in Macau arose from the desire to develop the territory, especially taking into account the signing of the Joint Declaration between Portugal and China in 1987.
The former Governor of Macau Garcia Leandro recalled the first moments of the creation of the future university in the book “Macau in the Years of the Portuguese Revolution 1974-1979”, which reads that the initial budget was 40 million patacas for construction “on land on the island of Taipa, with a modern architectural project”.
The institution should have capacity for “a population of two thousand students in four years, at a rate of 500 per year”, with “the leadership of the various course chairs guaranteed by a dean professor with a doctorate from the University of Oxford and by several university professors from Matteo Ricci, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and also from the USA”, it is described.
The first contract to train the teaching team and pedagogical content was signed in February 1979 with the Matteo Ricci group. “I believe it was another good service provided to the population”, wrote the former Governor. In 1991, the institution changed its name to what it currently has.
According to data from the 2024 annual report, the latest available, UM has 52,146 graduated students, and in the first semester of the 2024/2025 academic year, 15,147 students attended the university, from all educational levels. Highlight is the greater number of students from abroad, 9,328, compared to 5,819 local students.
Open day in Hengqin
Despite having been formally created in March, UM begins to celebrate 45 years of existence this Sunday with an Open Day. According to a statement from the educational institution, between 11 am and 5 pm the public will be able to visit the Lakeside Theater, where the first ceremony takes place, and then other areas of the campus in Hengqin, namely the main campus and the UM Scientific and Technological Research Institute in Zhuhai, in the Youth Entrepreneurship Valley in Hengqin.
This route also includes the possibility of visiting, for the first time, the Transitional Research and Education Site at Yuxin Tower, in the Cooperation Zone. “Through a wide range of on-site activities and live online broadcasts, the event will showcase UM’s latest developments and achievements in teaching, research and community service”, highlights the same note, which recalls how UM was the first higher education institution in Macau to “extend teaching and research activities to the Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin”.
That day there will also be “approximately 250 activities on the main campus throughout the day, including admissions lectures, academic and research activities and interactive games”.
"Visitors interested in academic subjects can attend engaging lectures on science and other disciplines, while sports enthusiasts can explore UM's sports facilities. Families can also participate in interactive games at stands, scientific experiments, workshops and knowledge challenges organized by various faculties, residences and laboratories", it is revealed. On Open Day there will also be discounts in the restaurant area.</description><pubDate>2026-01-09 02:07:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Church | Pope closes 2025 with criticism of consumerism and xenophobia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/07/igreja-papa-fecha-2025-com-criticas-ao-consumismo-e-xenofobia/</link><description>Pope Leo
The speech served to close the Jubilee - a Holy Year that usually takes place every 25 years, proclaimed by the Pope as a special time of forgiveness, reconciliation and spiritual renewal -, which brought around 33 million pilgrims to Rome and included a historic transition from one American pontiff to another.
In the presence of cardinals and diplomats from all over the world, Leo
This situation had only occurred once, in 1700. Yesterday's ceremony, at the beginning of the mass celebrating the feast of the Epiphany (when the three Magi offered gifts to the newborn Jesus) ended a dizzying year of special audiences, masses and meetings that dominated Leo XIV's first months as pontiff and put his own agenda on hold.
To signal that his pontificate can now begin in earnest, the Pope summoned cardinals from around the world to the Vatican, for meetings on Wednesday and Thursday that aim to debate the governance of the Catholic Church, with its 1.4 billion faithful.
To reflect
In yesterday's homily, Leo XIV said that the jubilee year invited all Christians to reflect on the biblical teachings of welcoming strangers and resisting the “flattery and seduction of those who hold power”. “Around us, a distorted economy tries to profit from everything”, he criticized, adding that he hopes that this year it will be possible to recognize “a pilgrim in the visitor, a seeker abroad, a neighbor in the stranger and a traveling companion in someone who is different”.
The Holy Years usually include large public works projects, as was the case with the construction of the Sistine Chapel (commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV for the Jubilee of 1475) and the large Vatican garage, where popemobiles and other vehicles are parked (commissioned by John Paul II for the Jubilee of 2000).
Some works were controversial, such as the construction of Via della Conciliazione, in 1950, which leads to St. Peter's Square and which involved the demolition of an entire neighborhood. Leo XIV also announced that the next Jubilee will be in 2033, to commemorate the 2000th anniversary of what the Scriptures indicate as the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, in 33 AD.</description><pubDate>2026-01-07 02:28:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Medals | Ho Iat Seng, Kou Hoi In and Raimundo do Rosário distinguished</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/05/medalhas-ho-iat-seng-kou-hoi-in-e-raimundo-do-rosario-distinguidos/</link><description>The list of winners is marked by the award of two Medals of Honor of the Great Lotus, the highest distinction in the Macao SAR, to Ho Iat Seng and Kou Hoi In. All the individuals awarded served in the Government or in the Legislative Assembly
The former Chief Executive, Ho Iat Seng, and the former president of the Legislative Assembly, Kou Hoi In, will be awarded the Great Lotus Medal of Honor, the Macao SAR's highest distinction. The list of the Executive's distinctions for 2025 was announced on December 31st, through a statement from the Social Communication Office, and the award ceremony is scheduled for January 30th, at the Macau Cultural Center.
The main distinctions awarded by Sam Hou Fai were to former rulers, with Macanese and former Secretary for Transport and Public Works Raimundo do Rosário being awarded the Golden Lotus Medal of Honor. This distinction will also be awarded to Ho Veng On, former Commissioner of Audit, and Vong Man Chong, former director-general of the Customs Service. Medals of honor aim to distinguish individuals or entities that have contributed to the image and good name of the Macao SAR.
After the list of medals was announced, Ho Iat Seng considered the title “a profound honor”. The former Government leader also stated, in a statement, that he “has always maintained a deep affection for Macau” and that over the years he has “dedicated” himself to “serving the nation and Macau”.
The former Chief Executive praised the results of his governance and considered that they depended “not only on the dedication and hard work of the government action team and all Public Administration employees, but also on the strong support and joint efforts of the community and all residents”. “This honor is a collective victory, which demonstrates the commitment of the entire society to drive greater and better development for the Macao SAR,” he stated.
The text awarding the Great Lotus Medal of Honor to Ho Iat Seng highlights the period in which the former ruler had to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. “During his term as the fifth Chief Executive, he united the Macao SAR Government and all social sectors, successfully overcame the severe challenges and difficulties of the Covid-19 pandemic and made every effort to promote post-pandemic economic recovery and social development”, it was stated.
In addition to being Chief Executive, Ho Iat Seng, a businessman by profession, was president of the Legislative Assembly, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and member of the Executive Council. This is the third time that Ho Iat Seng will be honored, after in 2001 having received the Medal of Industrial and Commercial Merit and in 2009 having been distinguished with the Golden Lotus Medal of Honor.
Another Lotus
Another distinguished businessman and former president of the Legislative Assembly is Kou Hoi In, notable for his activity as a member of the National People's Congress, the main legislative body of the People's Republic of China, and for more than 34 years as a deputy of the Legislative Assembly.
“In legislation work, supervision of government action and formulation of public policies, it has always defended the principles of carrying out functions in accordance with the law, in a rational and pragmatic manner, actively promoted the improvement of regimes and the construction of the rule of law and committed itself to safeguarding the rights and interests of residents and promoting social stability and long-term development”, it was considered. “During his term as President of the Legislative Assembly of Macau from 2019 to 2025, he focused his efforts on improving the efficiency of parliamentary functioning, promoting positive interaction between the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch, and made important contributions to strengthening the construction of the Rule of Law, promoting social harmony and improving the population's well-being policies”, it was added.
After leaving the Chamber, Kou was appointed to serve as chairman of the Board of Directors of TDM, he is also vice-president of the Board of Directors and general manager of the China Special Products and Productions Company and vice-president of the Macau Commercial Association.
In the past, the previous president of AL had been awarded the Industrial and Commercial Merit Medal in 2007 and the Silver Lotus Medal of Honor in 2016.
In Portuguese
Raimundo do Rosário, Secretary for Transport and Public Works, between 2014 and 2024, is the only representative of the Macanese community in the 2025 distinctions, taking into account the distinguished individuals and associations.
In the text about the former ruler, several positions held in public and private institutions are indicated. “He joined the Civil Service in 1979 and worked until 1990 successively as a senior technician, head of department, deputy director and director of the Land, Public Works and Transport Services”, it can be read. His CV also states that he was a member of the Portuguese delegation of the Portuguese-Chinese Land Group, deputy of the Board of Directors of CAM-Sociedade of Macau International Airport and head of the Macau Economic and Commercial Delegation, in Lisbon, also having charge of the Economic and Commercial Delegations to the European Union, in Brussels and the World Trade Organization, in Geneva.
Raimundo was also a member of the Drafting Committee of the Basic Law and the Preparatory Committee for the Establishment of the Special Administrative Region of Macau, deputy and member of the Supervisory Board of Banco Comercial de Macau.
In terms of medals of honor, the Macau Banks Association will be awarded the Silver Lotus, due to its “fundamental role in promoting sector collaboration and the solid development of the industry”.
Medals of Merit
In terms of the professional merit medal this year, only one distinction appears, for Chan Iok Lin, who has been a member of the Office of the President of the Court of Final Instance since 2000, having become head in 2016. “He has always demonstrated a rigorous and dedicated attitude in carrying out his duties, possessing excellent leadership and organizational skills, as well as a high level of professionalism and a spirit of dedication”, he was justified.
In the industrial and commercial area, the distinctions went to the state-owned company Companhia de Logística Nam Kwong, from the Nam Kwong group, for its contributions to the diversification of the economy and to businesswoman Amber Li Jiaming, who is president of the HN Group and member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), vice-president of the CPPCC Foreign Affairs Commission and member of the Council for the Economic Development of Macau.
At a tourist level, the only distinction was given to the House of Dancing Water Show Team, from Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment. The show was suspended during the pandemic, but returned after the end of border restrictions imposed during the years of combating Covid-19.
In terms of education, the Macau University of Science and Technology, Keang Peng School and Kao Yip School were distinguished. In culture, the distinctions went to the Chinese Opera Association of Maritime and Land Residents of Barra de Macau, deputy Lam Fat Iam and artist Chan Iu Pui, who draws caricatures for the newspaper Ou Mun.
Finally, an Altruistic Merit Medal will be awarded to the China International Emergency Medical Team (SAR) and Sports Merit medals to the MSAR Karate Team that participated in the National Games. Athlete Zhu Yuling, who defended the colors of Interior until 2024, when she moved to Macau, will also be honored. The athlete went on to represent the Macao SAR under professional staff promotion programs and won the women's singles title in the WTT of United States Smash Table Tennis, the first athlete from Macau to achieve this feat. Currently, she is a professor at Tianjin University.

Several voters again suggested the implementation of electronic voting.
It was a “somewhat confusing - as the world is at the moment -” presidential campaign, but one that Cristina Osswald made a point of following. And on this sunny, winter day in Macau, the Portuguese celebrate the possibility of choice. "Whenever possible I would listen to interviews, debates and presentations of the candidates. But it seemed to me that, perhaps, there is this issue of a dispersion of votes, which is part of democracy, isn't it? And especially when you live in a regime that is not democratic, you clearly appreciate democracy more", the professor at the Macau Polytechnic University tells Lusa after voting.
But the path that a Macau voter takes until the moment of voting, highlights Osswald, is not ideal. Having lived outside of Portugal for six years, the teacher notes that “procedures have improved”, although “they remain below expectations”. “The world is increasingly global, I see no reason why there should not be electronic voting”, considers the teacher, who, before Macau, passed through Florence, where to vote she had to go to Milan. “We can go to the bank [‘online’], to the finance department, and not being able to vote ‘online’ seems like something that doesn’t make much sense. I think that would be where there should also be greater investment. For example, here, people with little mobility cannot come and vote”, she declares.
Cristina Osswald looks at the staircase that leads to the consulate, where at that moment, elderly people are climbing the steps with difficulty – despite the fact that, at the back of the building, there is another door with access to an elevator.
"It is democracy that is losing. In times that are complicated and, I would say, almost dramatic, I think it would be an extremely simple thing to be able to vote online", continues the professor, also referring to the "little information" in Macau about the procedures leading up to the election. “I know a lot of people here in Macau, especially older people, who don't come to vote, because it wasn't announced that we had to register beforehand”, he notes.
Ancient pretension
Electronic choice has been a long-standing demand of the Council of Portuguese Communities, the Government's advisory body for policies relating to emigration and Portuguese communities abroad. Rui Marcelo, president of the Regional Council of the Portuguese Communities of Asia and Oceania, told Lusa last year that the topic “was addressed several times and with several governments”.
Félix Teixeira, a retired laboratory technician who has lived in Macau for 30 years, argues that online voting could serve especially regions where “travel is difficult”. “Macau is small, it doesn’t matter here.”
And what expectations do you have from the presidential elections? For the former employee of the Institute for Municipal Affairs, the multiplicity of faces on the bulletins is a good omen: “More voices are heard”, he says. And for emigrants, he emphasizes, being here today means getting closer to home: “If you are not in direct contact with the country, you are outside the entire circuit, politics and the social sphere”, he adds.
Feel from a distance
According to the consulate, there are more than 150 thousand Portuguese passport holders among residents of Macau and Hong Kong. However, when registered to vote, the number is almost three times lower: 57,748, according to data provided to Lusa by the diplomatic representation.
From the top of the stairs of the historic consulate building – formerly Hospital de São Rafael, founded in 1569 – the Macanese couple Francisco Xavier Leong and Alina da Luz ask for more attention from those abroad. “We hope that the new president will be more careful with foreign citizens, not just from Portugal”, says Leong. “We vote because we are Portuguese and, as good citizens, it is our duty”, adds the woman.
For the couple, who live nearby, voting in person is simpler. Francisco Leong even admits “more difficulty” with the electronic option. "Fortunately, in Portugal we have always had great confidence in the electoral results. There are many people who have doubts about electronic voting, but I think that if it is conducted well, it is a good option", says, in turn, José Paulo Esperança.
To Lusa, the Finance professor at the City University of Macau says he expects high participation in the ballot, because “there are concerns for Portuguese democracy” and “worrying candidates”. "Portugal – and the world – is experiencing developments that worry me. Because there is an increasing rise of the extreme right and phenomena that are very worrying", he states.
In the 2021 presidential elections, 1,479 people voted in Macau, or 2.1 percent of the total registered (70,134). Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa won in this Chinese region with 64.62 percent of the votes, followed by Ana Gomes (14.45 percent) and André Ventura (8.03 percent).</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 13:41:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Health | Meeting brings together authorities from Macau, Hong Kong and Mainland China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/saude-reuniao-junta-autoridades-de-macau-hong-kong-e-interior-da-china/</link><description>Last Thursday, the MSAR hosted the 20th Joint Meeting of the Health Administration Summits of Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, where the training of qualified staff, community health and the development of intelligent healthcare were discussed.
The meeting brought together more than 70 senior health administration officials and medical experts from the three territories also with the objectives of “deepening the exchange, sharing of experiences and discussion on the future direction of cooperation”, the Health Services indicated on Friday.
The Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam, highlighted that the Macao SAR Government will implement the strategy of giving “health priority” included in the “National Fifteenth Five-Year Plan” and execute the “Action Plan for Healthy Macau”, integrating physical and mental health elements into public policies. The leader also highlighted the launch of the “Well-being and Health Station” program, to take advantage of health resources in community neighborhoods.
Complying with the national “Year of Weight Management” initiative, O Lam stated that “community health self-examination stations will be increased” and residents will be encouraged to “be ‘first responsible’ for their own health”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 13:38:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Government | Sam Hou Fai talks about “good start” to his term</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/governo-sam-hou-fai-fala-de-bom-inicio-de-mandato/</link><description>The Chief Executive considers that the Government has made “a good start”. It was in this way that Sam Hou Fai took stock of the first year of governance, in a meeting with 70 members of the Administration to reiterate the need for rulers to “implement the spirit” of Xi Jinping's speeches.
According to the official version of the meeting, released by the Social Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai “stated that the work of the first year of this government took place in a stable, successive and peaceful manner, with reforms, innovations, advances and results”, which he considered to be “a good start”.
The Chief Executive praised public services for having as a priority “the fundamental interests of the Country and the integral interests of Macau” which are seen as “the starting point for installing a global mentality that firmly guarantees the sovereignty, national security and development interests of the Country, and ensures the stable and harmonious situation of Macau”.
Secondly, Sam highlighted the efforts of employees to strengthen “interdepartmental collaboration and cooperation in order to increase executive efficiency” and highlighted the “precise” implementation of government actions.
Sam Hou Fai also referred to “the importance of being more aware of shortcomings” and the need for shortcomings “to be checked as the work is carried out, in order to analyze existing problems and make appropriate improvements”.
Follow the spirit
Regarding the current year, Sam Hou Fai promised that he will continue “to fully implement the spirit of President Xi Jinping's speeches to plan future work”.
The Government leader also called for a single-minded Government, which maximizes the “central role of the Chief Executive”. “All guardianships and services must unify the same thinking, make every effort and collaborate proactively, with a high sense of responsibility and mission and thus create an enormous force to work and advance together, so that, together, they complete this priority task of the Macao SAR government for this year”, he stated. “At the same time, it must urge and improve the predominance of executive power, maximizing the central role of the Chief Executive and the Macao SAR government in the governance system,” he added.
And in this organization centralized around the Chief of Executive, the Legislative Assembly is also included: “The Secretary for Administration and Justice must effectively fulfill her duties and responsibilities, reinforcing coordination and cooperation to ensure that the Macao SAR government assumes its central governance functions with professionalism and pragmatism, in order to create a governance structure with an interconnection between the upper and lower levels and a synergy of cooperation between services, and to promote positive interaction between the executive powers and legislative bodies that cooperate, support and promote reciprocally, at an institutional, political and operational level”, he said.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 13:34:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Finance | Foreign Exchange Reserves reached 245.6 billion</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/financas-reservas-cambiais-atingiram-2456-mil-milhoes/</link><description>Macau's foreign exchange reserves stood at 245.6 billion patacas, equivalent to 30.64 billion US dollars, at the end of December, according to the most recent information from the Macau Monetary Authority (AMCM). The numbers were released yesterday and are part of preliminary estimates. The value of 245.6 billion patacas represents an increase of 2 percent compared to the corrected data from the previous month, which reached 240.8 billion patacas, or 30.05 billion US dollars.
At the end of December 2025, the Macao SAR's foreign exchange reserves corresponded to around 11 times monetary circulation, or 91.8 percent of the M2 monetary aggregate in patacas, according to data from the end of November 2025.
The effective exchange rate of the Macau pataca, weighted by its trade shares, was 101.1 in December 2025, recording decreases of 0.81 points and 5.47 points, compared to the data recorded in the previous month and those reported to December 2024. This variation means that the pataca fell against the currencies of Macau's main trading partners.</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 01:00:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Industrial Park | DSEDT wants the project to follow local reality</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/parque-industrial-dsedt-quer-que-projecto-acompanhe-realidade-local/</link><description>The Economic and Technological Development Services Department (DSEDT) says it is working on the creation of the Macau Science and Technology Research and Development Industrial Park, hoping that this project “accompanies the real needs of Macau's development”.
In response to the written question from deputy Ngan Iek Hang, the DSEDT considers that this is “an important project to boost the development of Macau's technological industry”, with a public consultation having been held between 27 November and 26 December 2025. Furthermore, an interdepartmental working group was created “for the purposes of coordination and consultation” of the project, with “in-depth studies and analyses” being commissioned from a “professional study team”.
Everything so that the authorities understand “the positioning, construction plan and complementary facilities of the Park”.

Professional training and the promotion of big health as one of Macau's core industries were some of the topics discussed


 
The Chief Executive met on Wednesday with the director and secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the National Health Commission, Lei Haichao, with the agenda marked by the desire to deepen cooperation, promote the development of the big health industry, and the integrated training of qualified personnel.
Sam Hou Fai defended the creation of a permanent collaboration mechanism between the Macao SAR Government and the National Health Commission to “further develop the healthcare and big health industry, both in Mainland China and in Macau”, a sector characterized as core to the territory's economy.
The connection between business and health was one of the guiding threads of the meeting, with Sam Hou Fai highlighting the need to “promote adequate diversification of the economy and fully take advantage of Macau's regional and political advantages”.
Another aspect that the leader of the Macau Government would like to see developed with the national commission is the strengthening of prevention and control of communicable diseases, although no details have been given on the subject.
 
Three-way conversations
The “cultivation” of qualified interdisciplinary staff in the health sector was another objective that Sam Hou Fai emphasized, stating “he hopes that the commission will provide strong support to Macau so that the city can fully take advantage of its role as a Sino-Lusophone platform”. The objective will be to raise the level of professionalism of the medical and nursing team through the training of staff “capable of serving international organizations”.
Before the director of the Islands Health Care Complex, Liu Zhengyin, who also participated in the meeting, the Chief Executive highlighted the symbolism that the unit represents for the “marking cooperation project between the Macao SAR and Mainland China in the field of health, under the principle of ‘one country, two systems’”.
The leaders of the National Health Commission traveled to Macau to participate in the 20th Joint Meeting of the Health Administration Summits of Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.
Also present at the meeting were the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, O Lam, the head of the Chief Executive's Office, Chan Kak, the director of Health Services, Alvis Lo, as well as several directors of entities in Mainland China.</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 00:48:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Communities | Rui Marcelo promises to listen to Portuguese people “with humility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/15/comunidades-rui-marcelo-promete-ouvir-portugueses-com-humildade/</link><description>The president of the Regional Council of Asia and Oceania of the Council of Portuguese Communities, Rui Marcelo, promises to “listen with humility” to the population throughout the new year. The promise was left in a message with a “renewed commitment” for the new year, disseminated through social media.
"Our first obligation is to listen. We will strengthen the channels of dialogue, ensuring that all voices from our diverse community feel truly represented", it was promised.
“The strength of our global Lusophone community has never resided in monologue, but in dialogue; not in forced unanimity, but in unity built on respect and shared purpose”, reinforced Marcelo. "May 2026 be the year in which, side by side, we demonstrate that what unites us – a glorious heritage and a future of unlimited potential – is infinitely stronger than anything that seeks to divide us. May this new cycle bring us the serenity for constructive dialogue, the courage to make the right choices and the tireless strength to serve", he added.
Rui Marcelo also promised to “act with transparency” pointing out that “each initiative, each project of the Asia and Oceania Regional Council will be conducted with absolute clarity”. “Our action will be measurable, oriented towards tangible results that strengthen cultural, economic and social ties in the regions we represent”, he added.</description><pubDate>2026-01-15 02:06:27</pubDate></item><item><title>This country is not for pregnant women</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/este-pais-nao-e-para-gravidas/</link><description>Young women in Portugal live in a dilemma. Those who study and complete a higher education course. Those who work in the most diverse professions, namely cleaning city streets, as informal caregivers, restaurant employees, in factories, digital platform coordinators, nurses, lawyers, Uber drivers, store employees, doctors, architects and so many, many professions that we can imagine. And the dilemma is your future. When they finish a course or start working, a large number of young people aged 25, 30 and even 35 continue to live in their parents' homes because their monthly income is not enough to buy or rent a house. Others, upon gaining independence and committing to a relationship or marriage, then come face to face with reality. The dream of having children.
Getting pregnant and having a child seems, at first glance, normal. But it's not. Nowadays in Portugal we know that the birth rate has decreased a lot and that the country already has a greater number of old people than young people. As for the birth rate, several factors contribute to the fact that young women and even women over 40, even those committed to a partner or husband, are faced with increasingly expensive homes, with a salary that does not even allow them to rent a house, if they actually live in Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra or Évora. Young women start to calculate their lives and immediately think how it will be possible to get pregnant if they remain in their parents' homes, some with their partner, how is it possible to rent a house to be able to have a child if the national minimum wage is one of the lowest in Europe, how can they buy a house on installments if not even their parents are available to be guarantors, how are they going to get pregnant if they then spend months in hospital appointments waiting for hours and hours and missing work, how can they get pregnant if they begin to panic when they hear the news that a pregnant woman has given birth at home without medical support, in an ambulance, in her husband's private car or even on the street, how can they think about having children if the same news they hear conveys a feeling of pain and bitterness because they learn that most Pediatrics and Gynecology - Obstetrics emergencies are closed and that pregnant women are transported by ambulance a distance of 200 and 300 kilometers walking from hospital to hospital to find an open emergency room. Some will say that the Government has improved INEM's customer service and that pregnant women can know what emergency services are available. Yes, available more than 100 kilometers away. And let's not talk about INEM. If we go that way, there aren't even ambulances and stretchers available to help the population. Recently, we witnessed the death of three Portuguese people due to a lack of assistance from INEM. The fact was so serious that the volunteer firefighters decided to make their ambulances available to INEM. A measure that deserves the best praise for this agreement between firefighters and INEM, which immediately saved the lives of several patients. But, of course, the “demon” had to appear. Continuously, a Civil Protection, which has served to make “pots” available to friends of those in power, soon came to the public, leaving us with our mouths open. Civil Protection had the nerve to maintain a position contrary to the agreement between volunteer firefighters and INEM. Obviously the firefighters ordered Civil Protection to dig potatoes and take a walk to Berlengas…
In such a scenario, how can a young woman think about getting pregnant without fear, without panic, without anxiety? It cannot, and so we reach the crucial point: the birth rate in Portugal has to decrease and there are increasingly fewer pregnant women. Conclusion: this country is not for pregnant women.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 14:21:18</pubDate></item><item><title>After the robbed house, you lock the door</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/depois-da-casa-roubada-trancas-a-porta/</link><description>There is an old Chinese saying that says, “It is not too late to fix the fence after the sheep have run away”, which has the same meaning as our proverb “After the house is robbed, you lock the door”. Only after we have been left without our assets do we realize that we have to take measures that can prevent future losses, but that do not allow us to recover what was lost.
The fire at Wang Fuk Court, a large housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district, destroyed many lives and many homes. The Hong Kong Government immediately provided assistance to the victims, quickly inspected the nets covering the scaffolding of all buildings undergoing maintenance in the city and created an Independent Committee to investigate the causes of the fire at Wang Fuk Court. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and the Police also acted promptly, arresting and charging those responsible for the fire. The measures that were taken after the accident demonstrate the authorities' great concern about what happened. However, if the various problems caused by maintenance work had been detected earlier, would the fire have been avoided? While putting out fires is necessary, preventing them is more important. As a neighbor of Hong Kong, Macau, although it did not suffer any devastating fires in 2025, has many aspects that need to be improved.
The stability and development of a society are inseparable from its political and economic systems. After the change of the Macao SAR Chief Executive in 2024, the Legislative Assembly election in 2025 witnessed the disqualification of candidates for the second time, along with the reshuffle of key leaders. According to the amendment to the Law “Electoral Assembly for the Legislative Assembly of the Macau Special Administrative Region”, “the decision of the CAEAL that a candidate does not have the capacity to be a candidate……, there is no room for complaint or legal appeal”, the disqualified candidates were not given the reasons for being considered that “they do not defend the Basic Law or that they are not faithful to the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China”.
Furthermore, the fact that Cheong Weng Chon went from Secretary for Administration and Justice to President of the VIII Legislative Assembly set a precedent for this Assembly. These actions taken by the Macao SAR Government established an absolute precedent for the predominance of executive power established by the Basic Law for the coming years. The absence of dissenting voices and close coordination between the executive and legislative branches have the advantage of unifying thought and action, which leads to a more fluid and efficient implementation of adopted policies and measures. However, it is worrying that when problems arise during the implementation process, there are no voices of opposition. And improving efficiency does not guarantee good results. We should not wait for problems to solve them, on the contrary, we should understand the causes of problems before they occur. After seeing the report on the fire in Hong Kong, it becomes obvious that the tragedy could have been avoided.
The challenges facing the diversification of Macau's economy are more complex than the difficulties it faced during the transformation that occurred in the early days after the return to Chinese sovereignty. If we just look at the increase in the number of tourists, at the GNI per capita at 572,614 patacas and the GDP per capita at 579,533 patacas, in 2024, we would think that Macau's economy should be flourishing, with no stores closed, with residents enjoying high incomes and restaurants packed with customers. Is this really the case? Those responsible for the economy know the truth, and citizens can see reality clearly. The closure of satellite casinos was predictable, while the creation of shopping districts and open-air cafes are only recent developments. Consumer trends such as cross-border shopping and online shopping are gaining great popularity, although the Government has taken emergency measures such as the “Grand prize for consumption in community areas” and “Discounts for eating at restaurants in celebration of Macau’s Return to the Motherland”. But what comes next? When prior planning falls far short of the course of events, and when all criticism is silenced, what remains is deep regret. A good shepherd does not allow a single sheep to go astray and the key to preventing them from getting lost is the shepherd.</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 02:09:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Portugal and the 2026 Presidential Scenario</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/15/portugal-e-o-cenario-presidencial-de-2026/</link><description>“When societies feel unheard, they do not fall silent – ​​they change the way they speak.” – Zygmunt Bauman
On January 18th, Portugal finds itself facing one of the most significant moments in its recent democratic history. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa's presidential cycle, which began in 2016 and concluded this year, ends with the constitutional impossibility of re-candidacy, opening space for a plural and unprecedented dispute. The presidential election, scheduled for January 18th, with a possible second round scheduled for February 8th, is not just a routine democratic exercise; It is a test of the country's institutional maturity, the capacity for renewal of political elites and the resilience of Portuguese society in the face of global challenges. The Portuguese semi-presidential system, enshrined in the 1976 Constitution, assigns moderating functions to the President of the Republic, but with relevant powers in times of crisis, such as the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic or the appointment of the Prime Minister.
Since the Revolution of April 25, 1974, all presidents have served two consecutive terms, and the inability of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa to run again opens up space for an original competition. The Portuguese presidency has been marked by figures that symbolize different phases of democracy with Ramalho Eanes as the military founder of post-revolutionary stability, Mário Soares as a Europeanist and defender of integration, Jorge Sampaio as a social moderator, Cavaco Silva as a liberal economist and Marcelo as an empathetic communicator. The 2026 succession is part of this historical line, but with its own characteristics, such as the absence of an incumbent, party fragmentation and the emergence of new political actors.
Among the candidates, figures from different political and social backgrounds stand out. Luís Marques Mendes, for the PSD, represents institutional continuity and the connection to the traditional center-right. António José Seguro, for the PS, is committed to social cohesion and defending the values ​​of April. Henrique Gouveia e Melo, independent, emerges as a candidate with strong popular appeal and an image of technical competence, as a result of his leadership in the vaccination campaign against COVID-19. André Ventura, for Chega, bets on a security and nationalist discourse, seeking to capitalize on social discontent. João Cotrim de Figueiredo, for the Liberal Initiative, defends the reduction of the weight of the State and economic liberalization. Catarina Martins, for Bloco de Esquerda, focuses on social justice and human rights.
This plurality reflects a more diverse but also more polarized society. Polls suggest that no candidate is expected to achieve an absolute majority in the first round, making a second round likely between two candidates from different blocs. Portugal enters 2026 with an economy marked by post-pandemic recovery, but also by structural challenges, such as low productivity, demographic aging and energy dependence. Tourism continues to be the economic engine, but faces sustainability pressures and the need for diversification. The digital and ecological transition is imperative, requiring consistent public policies and investment in innovation.
Socially, the country is experiencing tensions between the valorization of public services and fiscal pressure, between European integration and the resurgence of nationalist discourses. The aging of the population poses challenges to the sustainability of social security and intergenerational cohesion. Social inequality, although mitigated by redistributive policies, remains a central concern. The presidency, although it does not hold executive powers, can play a symbolic and mobilizing role, influencing agendas and promoting consensus. Portuguese culture, deeply rooted in historical memory and Portuguese-speaking projection, plays a central role in international affirmation.
The presidency symbolizes the continuity of republican and democratic values, with the President seen as the guarantor of stability and national unity. The plurality of candidates reflects different views on national identity, from the defense of April to security rhetoric, from social empathy to institutional technocracy. Portuguese cultural diversity, marked by the coexistence of local traditions and openness to the world, finds in the presidency a space of symbolic representation. The 2026 election will also be a moment of identity affirmation, in which values ​​such as solidarity, freedom and European belonging are debated. Portugal remains an active member of the European Union, participating in debates on economic integration, energy transition and common defense.
The 2026 presidency will be crucial to ensuring diplomatic stability in a global context of geopolitical tensions. The choice of a president with a conciliatory or more interventionist profile could influence the external perception of the country. The Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries continues to be a privileged space for international affirmation, strengthening historical and cultural ties. Membership in NATO guarantees strategic security, but also implies responsibilities in contexts of geopolitical tension. Portugal, due to its Atlantic and Portuguese-speaking position, plays the role of a bridge between continents and cultures, and the presidency symbolizes this international vocation. The President is seen as the guarantor of balance and national unity, especially in times of crisis. In addition to formal powers, the presidency has a symbolic dimension, representing collective values ​​and identities.
The philosophy of the Portuguese presidency is based on the idea that the President must be an arbiter and moderator, but also an inspiration and mobilizer. The 2026 election puts into debate different conceptions of the position with a more interventionist presidency, focused on moral authority, or a more discreet presidency, focused on institutional mediation. This philosophical reflection is essential to understand the meaning of the election. The polls available until January 13, 2026 continue to show an extremely competitive and fragmented Portuguese presidential race, marked by the absence of a clear favorite and the persistence of a high number of undecided voters. The most recent panorama reveals a significant recomposition in the front group in which António José Seguro and João Cotrim de Figueiredo now appear as the most dynamic candidates, while André Ventura and Henrique Gouveia e Melo register slight drops and Luís Marques Mendes drops to fifth place, with values ​​that fluctuate between around 15% and 17%, moving away from the immediate dispute for passage to the second round.
António José Seguro has benefited from a continuous growth trend since the end of 2025, supported by a profile perceived as stable and institutional. João Cotrim de Figueiredo, in turn, consolidated an upward trajectory that brought him closer to the core of the main candidates, reinforcing his appeal among young, urban and liberal voters. André Ventura maintains a strong core of expressive support, but continues to face difficulties in expanding his electoral base, appearing systematically weakened in the second round scenarios. Henrique Gouveia e Melo preserves a relevant capital of public trust, although it has lost some momentum in recent weeks, reflecting a more volatile and competitive political environment. Luís Marques Mendes, who came to lead voting intentions at the end of 2025, is now facing a consistent drop that places him outside the most competitive group, illustrating the electorate's sensitivity to last-minute movements and strategic repositionings.
The general picture remains marked by the coexistence of very different profiles with independent candidates with a strong public reputation, figures with long party experience and protagonists of more populist and security-based speeches. This diversity reflects an electorate divided between the search for institutional stability, the appreciation of technical competence and the desire for political renewal. Ventura's continued presence in the leading group, even with a low chance of victory in a second round, confirms the consolidation of a protest discourse that has found space in Portuguese society. In parallel, the growth of Cotrim de Figueiredo highlights the search for liberal and reformist alternatives, while the partial recovery of Seguro demonstrates the relevance of moderate profiles in a context of uncertainty.
Candidates less likely to reach the second round, such as Catarina Martins, António Filipe, Jorge Pinto or Manuel João Vieira, continue to play an important role in the plurality of the debate, representing specific agendas and contributing to the democratic vitality of the process. As a whole, the trends up to January 13, 2026 reveal a country in deep reflection about the type of leadership it wants for the next decade. Between tradition and innovation, continuity and change, European integration and national affirmation, the future President will be called upon to preserve republican and democratic values, interpret the expectations of a changing society and offer a vision capable of uniting different sensibilities in an increasingly demanding global context. These polls place André Ventura in an approximate range of between 19.5% and 20% of voting intentions in the first round of the presidential elections.
From these values, it is possible to project the number of votes that could be achieved in different electoral participation scenarios. If voter turnout is similar to that of the last presidential elections, with around 4.2 million voters, Ventura should receive between approximately 820,000 and 840,000 votes, remaining below the symbolic threshold of one million votes in this scenario of lower participation. If participation is close to that recorded in the 2024 legislative elections, around 6.5 million voters, the same percentage range would translate into a total of between approximately 1.26 million and 1.30 million votes, a value still lower than the level reached by the AD in the legislative elections. In the second round scenarios, polls place Ventura in a range between 25% and 29%. Applying these values ​​to a participation similar to that of the presidential elections, the candidate could obtain between approximately 1.05 million and 1.22 million votes.
If the turnout is comparable to that of the legislative elections, the projected range rises to values ​​between approximately 1.62 million and 1.88 million votes. Such an expressive vote for a candidate with this profile is often understood as a reflection of social tensions accumulated over time. It reveals a feeling of dissatisfaction with the functioning of institutions, the perception of persistent inequalities and the idea that issues such as security, justice, cost of living, immigration or the quality of public services have not received effective responses. At the same time, the growth of more direct and confrontational speeches shows that a significant part of the electorate is looking for simple language, firm positions and an attitude of defiance towards the traditional political system, even if this accentuates divisions.
This phenomenon also highlights the fragmentation of the party system, with less loyalty to traditional parties and greater openness to alternatives that break with the usual pattern. This dynamic changes balances, strategies and even the way campaigns are conducted. However, even with a high vote, there remain clear limits to the ability to transform notoriety into a majority, which indicates resistance in other sectors of society and contributes to a more polarized political environment, but not necessarily dominated by a single bloc. For the political system, a result of this type acts as a warning. It shows that there are groups that feel excluded, policies that are not meeting expectations and perceptions of injustice or insecurity that remain without a convincing answer.
This signal forces traditional parties to rethink priorities, adjust the way they communicate and reinforce proximity to different segments of the population. Finally, this movement is part of a broader trend observed in several European countries, where candidates with similar speeches have gained ground. Many analysts interpret this phenomenon as a consequence of cultural, economic and technological transformations that are profoundly altering people's relationship with politics and democratic institutions.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Mia Soave!…</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/14/mia-soave/</link><description>There are poems that we need completely. Anyone who does not know how to remember one in special times and adapt it to their situation suffers from a resource that cannot be replaced by any other skill. Without a learned poem, we are stripped of humanity in the face of the fierce blows of fate, our neuronal composition has no connections and everything becomes imprecisely misaligned. We are in the throes watching the death of those we saw being born, our immense pain does not need psychologists, priests, mentors, gurus, we just need something that comes towards us and that we can thank the heavens for having known about it. The poem.
In the agonizing dawn a poem is released like a well-said bird in farewell:« – Mia Suave..- Ave?! … Almeia?!… Blue Mariposa… Trance!… » and so we said goodbye on the border between death and life where the sound of the poem resonated in the telepathic night «It doesn’t hurt for you My Chest…/ Mia Soave…- Ave! – Almeia!…» And the lustral soul, still wounded, was able to spell out songs from the old angels, and soften passages, bypass the asphalt of the serious lack of a beloved being. It is a poem by Ângelo de Lima who dedicated it to his friends at Orpheu, introducing such eloquence that only in sacred situations do we remember it, but it is the things that remind us and intersect with the right effect of purposes, and great is the poet who blesses and guides us in such final moments.
We might say: what poem is this? It's a poem. It seems like a concrete poem made up of random meanings that aim to break the monotony of sentences made from feeling, its sequential metric, its canonical purpose, and therefore being distant and forgotten from the terreiro of things given in this matter, which on the other hand is the most beautiful poem in the Portuguese language of the twentieth century without appeal or annotation in the stagnation of descriptions of all kinds that do not reach balm in vital moments.
It is with a mix of surprise and delight that something like this happens to us, it is an initiation. Ângelo de Lima was savagely murdered in the corridors of psychoanalysis and psychiatric opinions at the time, his work didn't even gain traction in literary currents, but when he visits us, everything changes.
«– From Sunset to Epic… Dorto… Stringe… O Corpo Elance… Go to the Grave… – Il C´or rest…- Mia Soave… – Ave!… – Almeia!…»
This poem is full of light and tears, only those who know it are visited by it at the serious time of a farewell. He sings more than he spells, he is more a poem than a written thing, he caresses, ennobles and elevates, and when everything is clouded by broken love he still gives us the balm of the great mysteries.
Mia Soave, my Love « – It Doesn't Hurt For You My Chest…/ I Don't Cry in the Praying Cycle…/ In Profane…- Edd'ora…Elect!…» The dawn was advancing, the moon was high, and a poem visited the farewell curve like a song of love and death, but surprisingly in a future hope that doesn't yet know where it will be born again.
A mantra like this can lead us to think that the breath that comes from there saves our soul forever, giving the one that leaves a hitherto unknown dimension, and to those that remain the certainty that only great, great poetry saves beings and distinguishes them. And this is a great poem. Transfiguring, miraculous, beautiful. What comes to say sequentially is a challenge. That nothing says anything if the word doesn't have the dimension it brings us here.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 02:47:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Two more shows with Japanese artists canceled</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/cancelados-mais-dois-espectaculos-com-artistas-japoneses/</link><description>The shows by the boy band Nexz, made up of Japanese and Korean artists, were canceled on Friday, without any official explanation, according to a statement from concessionaire Sands China. The two concerts were scheduled for Saturday and Sunday and were sold out.
Initially, the band managed by JYP, one of the main Korean entertainment companies, had only planned one concert in Macau. However, the great demand, as early as December, led to a second show being scheduled the following day.
On Friday, one day before the first concert, the cancellation occurred. “We inform you that the concert “NEXZ SPECIAL CONCERT in MACAO”, originally scheduled for the 17th and 18th of January 2026, has been cancelled”, announced the concessionaire, via social media. “We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding and continued support,” it added.
Shows with the participation of Japanese artists in Macau began to be canceled, after a worsening of diplomatic tensions between Japan and China related to Taiwan.
Cancel culture
The wave of cancellation of shows with Japanese artists in China began in the interior. However, the trend extended to Macau. The first target in Macao was pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki, whose concert, scheduled for January 10th, was canceled on December 9th. Days earlier, on November 29, Hamasaki's concert in Shanghai had also been cancelled.
The cancellations didn't stop there, and at the beginning of the year it was time for Japanese singer Mika Nakashima's concert to be cancelled. At the time, the existence of “unavoidable circumstances” was presented as justification.
The cancellation of shows is not new. In January 2024, pressure from the IC led to the cancellation of the “Made by Beauty” show due to the participation of drag queens. However, IC president Deland Leong denied any involvement in the spate of recent cancellations.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 14:06:11</pubDate></item><item><title>CCM | Play “Goodbye, My Concubine” with workshops and activities</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/ccm-peca-adeus-minha-concubina-com-workshops-e-actvidades/</link><description>Between January 29th and February 1st, the Beijing People's Theater company presents four sessions of the play “Adeus, Minha Concubina” at Studio II of the Macau Cultural Center (CCM). Tickets cost 220 patacas and are on sale at the Enjoy Macao Ticket Office. Spectators can enjoy a 50 percent discount, “upon presentation of a valid Macau Resident Identity Card, Full-time Student Card, Macau Teacher Card, Special Benefits Card for the Elderly or Disability Assessment Registration Card”, said the Cultural Affairs Bureau on Friday.
The performance of the play presented by the Beijing People's Theater is one of the highlights of the “1st Season of Chinese Culture Shows”, which began at the end of November last year and runs until March. The cycle is organized by the IC and the Publicity, Culture and Sports Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Macao SAR, with the sponsorship of the Secretariat for Social Affairs and Culture.
The play, described by the organization as immersive, was written by Mo Yan, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. The IC adds that the production of “Goodbye, My Concubine” that will take the CCM stage “breaks with the traditional narrative structure of historical drama, exploring timeless themes such as power, survival and responsibility through multiple encounters and a structure of temporally intertwined dialogues between the characters Yu Ji and Lü Zhi”.
With an immersive scenic design, the audience will be surrounded by the Chu Army camp, sitting on cushions or straw benches arranged on various levels, to witness up close the intense plots of love and hate between the characters.
Learning with art
In addition to the four theater sessions, “workshops and complementary activities will also be organized that invite the public to participate and experience the beauty of traditional Chinese culture from multiple perspectives”, is described by IC.
On the 30th and 31st of January, after the show (between 10pm and 10:30pm), spectators will have the opportunity to talk to the artists. On January 27th, in anticipation, the “Inter-regional Dialogue between Young Artists” will be organized, which will feature “the main creators of the production and young actors from Mainland China and Macau”. The objective of this activity is to launch an “in-depth discussion about the construction of characters and the performing arts, deconstructing the creative process, perceptions and techniques for representing dramatic characters from multiple dimensions, such as action, personality and image”. The talk, scheduled for the Auditorium of the Macau Art Museum, is aimed at theater groups and young actors based in Macau and admission will be on a first-come, first-served basis.
In addition to the conversations, an enamel jewelry workshop will be held on January 31st between 4:30 pm and 5:30 pm in the Conference Room of the Macau Cultural Center, aimed at Macau residents over 6 years old
The next day, in the same place and at the same time, the Calligraphy Workshop for the Elderly will be held for Macau residents over 55 years of age.
Places are limited and interested parties can register on the Macau Single Account application.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>FAM | IC welcomes proposals for new edition of the festival</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/fam-ic-acolhe-propostas-para-nova-edicao-do-festival/</link><description>The Cultural Institute (IC) is welcoming proposals for shows and initiatives that can be integrated into the 36th edition of the Macau Arts Festival (FAM), which takes place between May and June this year. According to a statement, the idea is to provide opportunities for artistic personalities and local organizations.
“Over the years, FAM has sought to encourage the development of local arts and provide a quality platform for the presentation and exchange of performing arts in Macau”, describes the IC in a note.
The aim of FAM is to “expand the exhibition platform for local performing arts and incorporate more creative works with local characteristics”.
For this year's edition, the theme is “Cultural Encounter on the Maritime Silk Road”, inviting participants to “be inspired by Macau's unique cultural heritage”, to present works centered on the territory or “that incorporate specific elements of the city, such as historical architecture, notable figures, places and folk tales, exploring the city's distinct charm”.
Proposals in the competition must fall into two categories, namely “Individual Programs”, which incorporate “all genres of shows, such as theater, Cantonese opera, dance, children's shows and multimedia performing arts”. In this category, the IC encourages “innovation and creative advances in artistic creation”.
In turn, the second category, “Outdoor Showcase” consists of a “popular community program that seeks outdoor performances for the whole family and in a variety of formats”.
The programs selected by IC will receive financial support to cover production costs. Interested local associations and individuals must register by February 10th. Candidates approved in the first selection phase must attend an interview with the jury that same month.</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 02:04:07</pubDate></item><item><title>CCM | Musical “Operação Oops!” presented at the end of the month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/ccm-musical-operacao-oops-apresentado-no-final-do-mes/</link><description>Between January 31st and February 2nd, the small auditorium of the Macau Cultural Center hosts the musical “Operação Oops!”, based on the novel of the same name by playwright Lawrence Lei I Leong, born in Macau. The cast stars Jordan Cheng, who won the “Best Actor” award at the 31st edition of the Hong Kong Theater Awards
 
At the end of the month, Macau hosts a new show that takes place in the small auditorium of the Macau Cultural Center (CCM) and which is the result of a commission from the Cultural Institute (IC) within the context of the “Commissioning of Performing Arts Productions 2024-2026” program. This is the musical “Operação Oops!”, which takes the stage between January 31st and February 2nd.
According to a note from the IC, it is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by local playwright Lawrence Lei I Leong, and features several theater figures who have already won awards and have proven themselves in the world of entertainment.
The music for the show, for example, was composed by Leon Ko, who already won a Golden Horse at the Taiwanese film awards in 2005, for the soundtrack to the film “Perhaps Love”.
Furthermore, the public will be able to see up close the acting work of Jordan Cheng, protagonist of the “dynamic cast”, born in Macau and who was honored as “Best Actor” at the 31st Hong Kong Theater Awards. In turn, the show will be directed by Fong Chun Kit, one of the creative minds at the Hong Kong Repertory Theatre, while the choreography is designed by local dance creator Florence Cheong.
 
“Moving up in life”
“Operation Oops!” tells the story of a group of people who cannot find their way in life or have stability, and who, “disappointed with the exorbitant rent prices, decide to kidnap a real estate developer”, describes the show’s synopsis.
However, not everything goes as planned, and “frustrated by the occurrence of a series of unfortunate mishaps, the group sees their no-budget kidnapping plan enter a chaotic spiral”. Thus, “between constant arguments and jokes”, the public is led to understand how all this confusion will end.
“Illustrating a deliciously absurd story to the sound of captivating melodies, in a constant satirical and humorous tone, ‘Operação Oops!’ engages the audience in a surprisingly deep way”, like “discovering wisdom in a fun fortune cookie”, the synopsis also reads.
Alongside the presentations of the show, the IC “will invite representatives from various theater production entities, companies and art festivals from Mainland China and neighboring regions to travel to Macau in order to promote exchanges and hold a ‘Local Program Presentation Session'”, it is described in a statement.
The aim is to “create a platform to promote original works from Macau’s performing arts sector and explore opportunities for collaboration”. This session will take place on February 1st, at 3:15 pm, at Studio I of the CCM and will take place in Mandarin without translation, and is open to associations or companies linked to the performing arts, legally registered in Macau, or to individuals aged 18 or over who are residents of the territory. Registration opens today and runs until January 27th.</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 01:59:51</pubDate></item><item><title>New association wants to contribute to the study of law in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/nova-associacao-quer-contribuir-para-o-estudo-de-direito-em-macau/</link><description>The Association of Legal Studies of Macau and Portugal was created to give life to a mega undertaking, the publication of the annotated Macau Civil Procedure Code, and, later, of works “outside the most popular topics”.
David Sá Machado, a Portuguese lawyer working in Macau, is the ideologue of what will be the first annotated version, published in full, of the Civil Procedure Code of the semi-autonomous Chinese region.
The three volumes, with the contribution of around 60 authors, including “lawyers, magistrates, academic professors, advisors and other jurists from Portugal and Macau”, should see the light of day later this year, the person responsible explains to Lusa, noting that they are in the review phase. “If there are changes to the code planned, we may delay a little”, he adds.
To facilitate the publication of the work, “an added value” that aims to be a “contribution to law in Macau”, the Association of Legal Studies of Macau and Portugal was created.
“Other projects will emerge later”, says Lusa Sá Machado, president of the association, indicating the intention of, in the future, organizing “more pedagogical and more didactic initiatives”.
Still talking about this project of around three thousand pages and coordinated by two women – Maria José Capelo, associate professor at the Faculty of Law at the University of Coimbra, and Teresa Leong, retired judge from Macau – the lawyer notes that it will be produced in Portuguese, although a Chinese version is also planned, as “the target audience is jurists from Macau”.
“An annotated code should serve to clarify the reader of the various interpretative meanings of the norms and, perhaps, add something from the point of view of the right to be constituted”, he indicates. “I think it always enriches any legal system”, he adds
Existing versions
Macau has annotated versions of the Civil Code, the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, and between 2006 and 2008, the first two volumes of the annotated and commented Code of Civil Procedure were published, authored by Cândida da Silva Antunes Pires and Viriato de Lima. The work, however, remained unfinished, recalls the lawyer.
Sá Machado, also one of the authors, defends the importance of the project: "We are always using Portuguese codes, Portuguese notes. We are left with something of our own."
Still talking about the work, which will be published in Portugal by Edições Almedina – after making “some approaches in Macau, informally” -, the lawyer says that “I would like it to be a reference work”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Birth rate | Equality and balance between essential work and life</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/natalidade-igualdade-e-equilibrio-entre-vida-e-trabalho-essenciais/</link><description>A UPM academic believes that Macau should legislate equal parental leave, promoting gender equality and balance between personal life and work, which she claims are essential factors in reversing the drop in birth rates.
“The balance between professional and personal life is a key factor in boosting the fertility rate,” Lok Cheng, an academic at the Macau Polytechnic University (UPM) who studies public policy, told Lusa.
Lok's research, which compares Macau's parenting policies with those of countries such as Germany, Sweden and the United States, supports this conclusion.
Macau recorded the lowest birth rate in the world in 2024 and the lowest number of births in almost 50 years in 2025, said, at the beginning of the year, the deputy director of the Macau public hospital, Tai Wa Hou, quoted by the Chinese language channel of the public broadcaster TDM Macau. This decline has persisted despite a revised budget approved last year to strengthen social supports, including subsidies for parents with children up to three years old, increases in birth benefits and marriage subsidies.
Macau currently offers 70 days of maternity leave and only five days of paternity leave for workers in the private sector (in the public sector it is 90 days for mothers and five for fathers), recalled the expert: “Less than the 98 days recommended by the International Labor Organization”, she said.
This disparity, argued Lok, reinforces the idea that women have the main responsibility for newborns, which also has an impact on their professional career. “We have tacitly accepted that women have a greater responsibility for caring for newborns, and this is reflected in the workplace,” he continued.
Look out
In contrast, the expert, who is also a civil servant, points to European policies. “Sweden has a well-established parental policy and saw an increase in the birth rate in the early 2000s,” he said. “Both Germany and Sweden provide longer maternity leaves and are actively promoting father participation”, he reinforced.
Lok explained that Sweden offers more than 300 days of shared parental leave, with 90 days reserved exclusively for the father.
“Macau currently has no relevant regulations regarding fathers”, noted the academic, suggesting that the region could learn from this model to implement equal parental leave and “promote gender equality in the workplace”.
Such a policy, he said, would help families share childcare and “eliminate gender bias that places women as the main caregivers”. “This prejudice is harmful to women’s professional development”, he assessed.
According to the latest official data from the Macau Women's Database, the average monthly salary of the female population in 2024 was 16,800 patacas, lower than the 19,300 patacas earned by men.
Lok explained that many women are hesitant to have children, fearing increased family duties and career stagnation. But when childcare is shared, “this can increase the desire to have children and reduce the associated costs”.
Such a change would also benefit women professionally, he added. If parental duties were distributed more equally, “companies would be less concerned about gender when hiring women of childbearing age, and women would be able to pursue careers on an equal footing.”
Lok acknowledged that it may be a challenge for Macau to adopt a system like Sweden's, but it is necessary to “move forward gradually”. “The first step is to increase maternity leave to 98 days, in accordance with international standards”, he concluded.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 13:54:18</pubDate></item><item><title>One Oasis | Request for postponement of entry into force of new law</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/one-oasis-pedido-adiamento-de-entrada-em-vigor-de-nova-lei/</link><description>The One Oasis housing complex condominium will contact the administration to try to postpone the entry into force of the new law that prohibits hiring services from tourism agencies to transport residents of the building. The decision was taken on Friday, after a condominium meeting attended by more than 120 people, including representatives of public transport companies, and the solution aims to buy time to implement other measures.
The controversy over the buildings' shuttle services arose after the Government proposed a law, unanimously approved by the Legislative Assembly last year, which clarified the type of services that can be provided by tourism agencies. As a consequence, the Executive promised a campaign against these agencies when they provide the shuttle bus service to residential buildings. In a statement, the Tourism Services Directorate also indicated that the law does not change anything, and that the ban already existed.
The law change caught many residents off guard. Thursday's One Oasis condominium meeting aimed to seek a solution to the problem. The path thus involves hiring one of the only two companies that can now provide the service. Transmac charges 420 patacas for each bus trip, with a vehicle with 22 seats and 38 standing seats, an average of 7.1 patacas per person. TCM did not present a budget in time for the meeting. However, the condominium considered that it needs more time to apply the new model, and is seeking to obtain a postponement of the entry into force of the new law from the Government.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 13:51:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Legend | Cape Verdean government takes possession of hotel-casino</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/macau-legend-governo-cabo-verdiano-toma-posse-de-hotel-casino/</link><description>The Cape Verdean government announced on Friday that it took possession of the assets and building of the hotel-casino that operator Macau Legend, which is facing financial difficulties, began building in the capital, Praia, but abandoned years ago.
The inauguration took place on Friday, concluding the reversal process relating to the project which was based on a memorandum of understanding signed with the State, in 2014, for “tourism-real estate investment, in the Cidade da Praia Bay, including the Ilhéu de Santa Maria and Gamboa beach”, informed the Government.
In a statement, the executive reiterated that he “did everything to ensure the implementation of the project”, but the contracts “were irremediably breached” by the investors.
In 2015, Macanese businessman David Chow announced an investment of 250 million euros. After reviews, the completion of the first phase of the project was scheduled for 2021. At the end of 2023, the president of Macau Legend, Li Chu Kwan, said that the group intended to close the projects in Cape Verde and Cambodia.
Currently, there are only guards at the gates of the enclosure, an area of ​​around 160,000 square meters, which includes the islet, partially gutted, and an asphalt bridge a few meters long that connects it to a building of around eight floors, empty and fenced with walls – which, in the meantime, have begun to be removed.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 13:48:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | VIP revenues rose 24.1% throughout 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/jogo-receitas-vip-subiram-241-ao-longo-de-2025/</link><description>Revenues from high rollers, a segment known in Macau as VIP gaming, rose 24.1 percent in 2025, according to official data released on Friday. The VIP baccarat game reached revenues of MOP68 billion last year, revealed the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Department (DICJ).
In the last quarter alone, revenue from big bets increased by 45 percent compared to the period between October and December 2024, to 20.3 billion patacas.
However, VIP gaming in Macau remains far from the historic peaks reached before the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2019, baccarat for this segment represented 46.2 percent of total casino revenues. But in 2025 it was left with a share of 27.5 percent.
Big bets were affected by the arrest of the leader of the largest VIP bet collecting company in the world, in November 2021.
The former executive director of Suncity Alvin Chau Cheok Wa was sentenced, in January 2023, to 18 years in prison, in a case that saw the number of gambling promoter licenses issued in Macau drop from 85 to 18.
According to data from DICJ, the number of licenses has been recovering and reached the mark of 30 at the end of July, a number that was maintained in the most recent update, on December 15th. Even so, it remains below the maximum limit set by the Government, which is 50.
Number to increase
Revenues from the most popular game in Macau, baccarat in the so-called mass market, also increased by 3.4 percent in 2025, to 137.9 billion patacas.
Mass baccarat represented 57.7 percent of total casino revenue in the territory last year, being by far the most popular game of chance among Chinese gamblers.
Gaming machine revenue increased by 7.3 percent compared to 2024, to MOP13.9 billion.
In 2025, Macau's casinos recorded total revenue of 247.4 billion patacas, an increase of 9.1 percent.
The Macau Government had forecast, in the initial budget for 2025, gaming revenue of 240 billion patacas, which would represent an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
However, on June 11, the Legislative Assembly approved a new budget, proposed by the Executive, which reduced the forecast for public revenue by 4.56 billion patacas.
The Secretary for Economy and Finance, Anton Tai Kin Ip, admitted to deputies that the cut was due to the fact that the game's gross revenues in the first quarter of 2025 were “slightly below expectations”.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 13:45:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Administration | Office works in the second quarter</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/administracao-obras-para-escritorios-no-segundo-trimestre/</link><description>The public tender proposals for the work on the superstructure of an office building for the administration in ZAPE were opened yesterday. 28 applications were received and work should begin in the second quarter of this year, after works on foundations and basements, which should end in March
 
 
 
Another step was taken yesterday towards the construction of the office building for the Public Administration on lot Q-1 in ZAPE, with the opening of proposals submitted to the public tender for the construction of the superstructure.
The Public Works Services Directorate revealed that 28 proposals were presented and that works should begin in the second quarter of this year, after the foundation and basement work has been completed. Of the 28 proposals presented, only one was excluded. The proposed prices vary between around 309 million patacas and around 351 million patacas, while deadlines range between 618 and 625 working days.
The authorities said that the construction of foundations and basements is progressing as planned and should be completed in March.
The building will be built on a plot of land on the corner of Avenida Dr. Rodrigo Rodrigues and Rua do Terminal Marítimo, close to the Hotel Jai Alai, and is part of a set of five projects designed to add an area of ​​more than 130 thousand square meters to the Macao SAR's public services. The idea is to reduce public expenditure on rentals.
 
Final product
The building will be located on a plot of land with an area of ​​around 2,770 square meters, will be 12 floors high and have three basement floors and the maximum execution time for the superstructure is 650 working days.
The previous works, of basement foundations, were awarded to Companhia de Fomento Predial Sam Yau for around 79.3 million patacas, while the design work was carried out by Luís Sá Machado, Conceição Perry and Isabel Bragança Arquitectos, for 10 million patacas. Quality control was awarded to the Macau Civil Engineering Laboratory for 1.1 million patacas, while inspection was carried out by Fernando Cardoso Botelho -Fcb – Engineering Office for 5.8 million patacas.
The Macau Civil Engineering Laboratory was once again the entity chosen to monitor peripheral structures, for more than 1.7 million patacas. Finally, the assessment and verification of the project within the scope of electromechanical engineering was handed over to the Institute for Development and Quality, Macau for 1.1 million patacas.
In total, the construction phase of foundations and basements cost 99 million patacas.</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 01:31:40</pubDate></item><item><title>SMG | Warning for cold weather next week and typhoon in the Philippines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/smg-alerta-para-frio-na-proxima-semana-e-tufao-nas-filipinas/</link><description>The Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) warned yesterday that next week Macau will once again be under the influence of a winter monsoon, starting from Wednesday, which will cool the territory with minimum temperatures dropping to at least 12º Celsius. The same phenomenon will result in sunny days, making the days hot, and the nights cold, with thermal differences being “quite significant”.
Authorities also indicated that an area of ​​low pressure, located east of the Philippines, has evolved into a tropical storm, “with the potential to become the first tropical storm of this year”. The storm, named “Nokaen”, has “quite low” chances of entering the South China Sea and affecting Macau.
The SMG report that, although January is a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere, sea surface temperatures in the northwest Pacific Ocean remain relatively high (equal to or greater than 28ºC).
According to the SMG, since records began in 1968, the earliest month in which tropical cyclone signals were issued in Macau was April.</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 01:26:48</pubDate></item><item><title>ZELENSKY VS ZELENSKY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.

At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke at length and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. It says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no such thing as chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is usually used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in others. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this mistake. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who didn't love anyone./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria stayed with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely outside our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J. Pinto Fernandes emerges at the exact moment when we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but this only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows everyone else and the joy of recognizing that the yardstick of the world is not measured with my short measure and that, on the contrary, it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican for writers from the north, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thought about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché “all different, all equal”, a return to “diplomacy”, given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that “we are unified because we share the same nature” but simply highlights that we “still do not share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that quenches your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and impressive, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unresponsive to reins and containment.
Let men refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because despite the fact that there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish, because of it the tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the pride of the countries will be destroyed.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert”.
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that muzzle, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relationships were restricted, or if it merely lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Obviously, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as a hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the position of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, in a different way, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE

I let the daughters of all fathers tied to trees be raped,

[everything be the same.
God have mercy on me, I didn't have it from anyone!

The news was released at a time when an investigation is being carried out in Seoul in response to Pyongyang's accusations about the presence of drones in North Korea, in September 2025 and at the beginning of this year.
The first suspect, a man in his 30s, who apparently only worked on manufacturing the drone, was a news supervisor in the presidential spokesperson's office during the Yoon government, according to the agency.
The other suspect, also in his 30s and also working at the presidential complex during the Yoon government, publicly claimed to have operated the drones, in an interview broadcast on Friday by local channel Channel A. The suspect is currently pursuing postgraduate studies in journalism at a private university in Seoul.
The two suspects studied at the same university and founded a drone manufacturing company in 2024, according to Yonhap.
The investigation does not specify the exact years they worked for Yoon, who began his term in May 2022 and ended in April last year, after being removed by the brief declaration of martial law in December 2024.
Yoon Suk-yeol, currently in pre-trial detention, faces charges of abuse of power and other crimes related to the alleged sending of drones to North Korea to disseminate anti-Pyongyang propaganda.
The Public Ministry alleges that the then president ordered the operation to provoke a reaction from the neighboring country and justify the imposition of martial law.
Flights of discord
North Korea accused the South at the UN, in February last year, of sending drones in October 2024 to spread propaganda over the capital Pyongyang.
Yonhap's work also indicates that the first suspect was already interrogated on Friday by the investigation team of the South Korean armed forces and police.
The man was reported to the authorities in November for flying an unregistered drone in the Yeoju area, about 70 kilometers southeast of Seoul, and the model of the device coincided with the one North Korea claims to have shot down in the most recent report.
In an interview with a local channel, the second suspect said that, since September last year, he had carried out several flights over North Korea and that the objective was to measure the levels of radiation and contamination by heavy metals in a uranium factory near the Ryesong River, in North Korean territory.
North Korea reported on January 10 that South Korean drones flew over the territory in September last year and again on January 4 this year.
The government of the current South Korean President, Lee Jae-myung, denied that the drones were military aircraft and began an investigation this week, without ruling out the possibility of civilian involvement.
The North Korean accusation came as a surprise, given that Lee had told the EFE news agency in December that Seoul might have to apologize to Pyongyang for alleged drone flights during Yoon's presidency.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 14:18:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | “Healthy and stable” relations serve the interests of China and Canada</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/19/diplomacia-relacoes-saudaveis-e-estaveis-serve-interesses-de-china-e-canada/</link><description>The Canadian government leader's visit to China marked the return of healthy understanding between the two nations after a period of tensions and disagreements.
The President of China, Xi Jinping, stated Friday that the development of “healthy and stable” relations with Canada serves the interests of both countries, during a meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister.
Xi met in Beijing with Mark Carney, in what is the first visit by a Canadian head of government to the country in almost a decade and which aims to normalize bilateral relations, which have gone through periods of tension in recent years, due to diplomatic and commercial disputes.
During the meeting, held at the Great Hall of the People, Xi stated that the “healthy and stable development” of relations between China and Canada “corresponds to the common interests of both countries” and contributes to “world peace, stability and prosperity”, according to Chinese state television CCTV.
The Chinese leader highlighted that the previous contact between the two, in October, on the sidelines of a summit in South Korea, began a new phase of rapprochement. Xi called for the construction of “a new type of strategic partnership” capable of putting ties between Beijing and Ottawa on a “sustainable and lasting” path.
Carney thanked the reception and expressed Canada's willingness to work with China “based on good past cooperation”, to develop a strategic relationship adapted to the current international context and promoting “stability, security and prosperity” for both countries and the Pacific region.
The day before, the Canadian Prime Minister met with his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang. The two discussed topics such as economic cooperation, energy and trade, and witnessed the signing of several agreements in the customs and commercial areas.
Reinforced ties
According to CCTV, Carney reiterated Canada's interest in strengthening cooperation in supply chains and strategic sectors, as well as its commitment to multilateralism and the international trade system.
Li Qiang advocated expanding cooperation in areas such as clean energy, modern agriculture, digital technologies and the aerospace industry.
Also on the sidelines of the visit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand, highlighting the need to eliminate interference and strengthen mutual trust to promote a “stable, solid and healthy” relationship.
Carney's visit is the first by a Canadian prime minister to China since Justin Trudeau's visit in 2017, and takes place in a context of growing instability in international trade, with Ottawa seeking to diversify economic partnerships.</description><pubDate>2026-01-19 14:14:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Thailand | New crane collapse leaves two dead and one injured</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/tailandia-novo-colapso-de-guindaste-faz-dois-mortos-e-um-ferido/</link><description>Two people died and one was injured after a crane fell onto a road on the outskirts of Thailand's capital, a day after a similar incident that killed at least 32 people.
“Two people died and one was injured,” police officer Saranyapong Aonsingh told EFE news agency, adding that security officers were at the scene of the accident, where a viaduct was being built.
According to reports from the Thai rescue and fire services on the social network Facebook, the crane collapsed at around 9:15 am, for reasons still unknown, at a construction site on the Rama II highway, in the province of Samut Sakhon, on the outskirts of Bangkok, hitting two cars.
This accident happened one day after another crane fell on a passenger train, with 171 people on board, in northeastern Thailand, causing at least 32 deaths and more than 50 injuries.
In both cases, the projects were linked to the local company Italian-Thai Development, according to Thai Transport Minister, Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, in a television interview today.
“We don’t know exactly what happened to the company (…). If the situation continues, we may have to announce a temporary stop of all its operations across the country”, he added.</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 02:16:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Canada | Prime Minister Mark Carney visits Beijing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/canada-primeiro-ministro-mark-carney-de-visita-a-pequim/</link><description>After years marked by diplomatic incidents and disagreements, the Canadian Prime Minister's trip to China is seen as a new chapter in relations between the two nations


 
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's visit to China, the first by a Canadian head of government in eight years, is seen by both countries as the beginning of a new phase in bilateral relations.
According to a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, head of diplomacy Wang Yi considered Carney's visit a “turning point” with the potential to open “new perspectives” in the relationship between Beijing and Ottawa.
Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand, who met with Wang yesterday, stated that Carney intends to “set the course for the development of relations” and resume dialogue in multiple areas, according to the same note.
Carney, who took office 10 months ago, is trying to reestablish ties with Beijing after a period marked by disagreements, which included the detention, in 2018, of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, at the request of the US, and the imposition of mutual tariffs on strategic products such as electric vehicles, steel, aluminum, canola and seafood.
The Canadian Prime Minister met yesterday with his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang, and is expected to meet with President Xi Jinping tomorrow.
 
Trump Factor
The mission gains urgency at a time when US President Donald Trump has increased tariffs on Canadian exports.
Currently, more than 75 percent of Canada's exports are destined for the United States. Carney has set a goal of doubling Canadian exports outside the North American market over the next decade.
“We are ready to build a new partnership, based on the best of our past and prepared for the challenges of the present”, wrote Carney on the X network after arriving in Beijing, on Wednesday night.
The tariffs applied by Canada in 2024, under Justin Trudeau's government, followed the US example and imposed 100 percent duties on Chinese electric vehicles and 25 percent on steel and aluminum.
In response, Beijing applied tariffs of 100 percent to Canadian canola oil and meal, 75.8 percent to canola seeds and 25 percent to pork and seafood products, practically closing the Chinese market to these exports, according to industry sources.
China has expressed hope that the economic pressure exerted by Trump will lead US allies, such as Canada, to adopt a more autonomous foreign policy.
Beijing frequently accuses Washington of forming alliances to isolate China, a common line of criticism under the Joe Biden and Trump administrations.
Relations between the two countries seriously deteriorated in 2018, when Meng Wanzhou was detained in Canada at the request of the US.
China retaliated with the arrest of two Canadian citizens for alleged espionage, in an episode that froze diplomatic dialogue for more than two years.</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 01:51:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Corruption | Philippines wants ex-deputy repatriated</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/15/corrupcao-filipinas-quer-repatriacao-de-ex-deputado/</link><description>The Philippine President has ordered the country's government to explore all options for Elizaldy Salcedo Co to be repatriated from Portugal, where the former congressman is believed to be living, according to the Philippine press.
Better known as Zaldy Co, former party deputy Ako Bicol is the subject of an arrest warrant for alleged involvement in the scandal of infrastructure “ghost projects” for flood control. Dozens of construction company owners, government officials and elected representatives across the archipelago are accused of embezzling funds or executing substandard projects.
In addition to facing three criminal cases arising from the corruption scandal, Zaldy Co also made explosive allegations in a series of videos accusing Marcos Jr. and his cousin, former speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives Martin Romualdez, of receiving billions of pesos in bribes, according to the Philippine newspaper Inquirer.
Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla said on Tuesday that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s directive orders it to be verified whether Zaldy Co can be extradited from Portugal, where he is believed to be located. "We are still studying the case because the situation is complicated. We don't have an extradition treaty [with Portugal], but there are other routes that we can follow and that he wants to investigate," Remulla said, according to the English-language Philippine newspaper.
Other routes
The Government, continued the official, is considering other options, including coordination with the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), the UN and other international agencies, he added. "An [extradition] treaty would take too long. A treaty takes years and years to conclude. Therefore, the other possible routes, as instructed by the President, are about how we can carry out his extradition without going through a treaty", he said on Tuesday.
Through repatriation, the Inquirer also states, a person can be returned to their country of origin by choice or by force. In the case of extradition, “it is a legal process in which a country delivers a person accused or convicted of a crime to another country to face trial or punishment”.
The newspaper also recalls that the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) canceled Co's Philippine passport on December 10 last year, on the order of an anti-corruption court. Remulla, however, stressed that Co may also be using a Portuguese passport obtained many years ago.
No news
According to the DFA, the Philippine Embassy in Lisbon has not yet received information about Co's whereabouts or any confirmation from the Portuguese Government that it actually granted the former deputy a passport.
Leila de Lima, a deputy from the Mamamayang Liberal party, also said on Tuesday that the Marcos government should negotiate with Portugal on the deportation of Co to the Philippines, instead of working on an extradition treaty “which requires much more effort and more time”.
“Deportation can be negotiated diplomatically immediately, even without the formality of concluding an extradition treaty”, said Leila de Lima, noting that “an extradition treaty is not indispensable for the return of a fugitive to the country”.
Among the suspects are allies and opponents of Marcos Jr. At stake are 9,855 drainage control projects, valued at more than 545 billion Philippine pesos (eight billion euros), which should have been built since Marcos took power, in mid-2022.
In September, Philippine Finance Minister Ralph Recto admitted that, since 2023, 118.5 billion pesos (around 1.75 billion euros) may have been embezzled.</description><pubDate>2026-01-15 02:44:05</pubDate></item><item><title>At least 25 dead after crane falls on train in Thailand</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/15/pelo-menos-25-mortos-apos-guindaste-cair-sobre-comboio-na-tailandia/</link><description>At least 25 people died yesterday when a construction crane fell onto a passenger train in northeastern Thailand, authorities said.
The crane fell as the train was traveling from the capital Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani province, causing the derailment and a fire, according to the Public Relations Department of Nakhon Ratchasima province.
The accident occurred at around 09:00, involving a crane that was being used in the construction of a high-speed elevated railway. The department said in a social media post that the fire was under control and that rescue teams were now searching for people inside the train, many of whom were trapped in overturned train cars.
Rescue operations had been temporarily suspended due to a “chemical leak”, local police reported, without specifying the origin. “More than 80” people were injured, Thatchapon Chinnawong, head of a police station in Nakhon Ratchasima, northeast of Bangkok, told France-Presse news agency.
Transport Minister Piphat Ratchakitprakan said there were 195 people on board the train and said he had ordered an investigation into the accident, which occurred in Ban Thanon Kho, 32 kilometers from Bangkok. Thai media outlets and internet users published numerous images of the disaster on social media, showing part of the fire and dozens of rescuers at the scene.
“I heard a loud noise (…) followed by two explosions,” said Mitr Intrpanya, 54, a resident who was at the scene. "When I went to see what had happened, I found the crane resting on a three-car passenger train. The metal from the crane appeared to have split the second car in half," he added.
Little supervision
The crane was part of a vast high-speed train construction project in Thailand, which began in 2017, a decade late. The US$5.4 billion project aims to connect Bangkok to Kunming, in southern China, via Laos. The first section is scheduled to open in 2028 and the second in 2032.
The line is supported by China as part of the One Belt, One Road initiative, launched to boost trade in the region. Industrial, construction and transport accidents are relatively frequent in Thailand due to sometimes lax enforcement of safety standards.
In 2020, 18 people died in Thailand when a freight train collided with a bus carrying passengers to a religious ceremony. Eight people also died in 2023, in a collision between a freight train and a van that was crossing a railway in the east of the country.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Hong Kong | John Lee promete “ir ao fundo” de incêndio Tai Po</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/15/hong-kong-john-lee-promete-ir-ao-fundo-de-incendio-tai-po/</link><description>The leader of the former British colony reiterated his intention to punish those responsible for the tragedy that killed more than 160 people in the Tai Po social neighborhood and find appropriate solutions for those displaced.
Hong Kong's Chief Executive yesterday promised to "get to the bottom" of the deadly fire in Tai Po, hold those responsible accountable and find long-term solutions to house those affected, the public broadcaster reported. According to RTHK, John Lee Ka-chiu indicated to the Legislative Council (LegCo) that post-disaster recovery work is an “urgent task”, with the Executive presenting a motion of support at the first meeting of parliament.
The Government, the person responsible told deputies, “will finalize the long-term accommodation plan for the affected families as quickly as possible, so that they can settle in their new homes soon”. Lee assured that those responsible for the November 26 tragedy will be held accountable.
“The police authorities and the independent committee will leave no stone unturned,” he said, promising to “get to the bottom of this issue.” “Those who must be held responsible, whether they are public servants or not and regardless of their level, will be held responsible according to the facts”, he added.
The fire in the Wang Fuk Court residential complex, which is undergoing repair work, started when the net covering the bamboo structures between the ground floor and the first floor of the Wang Cheong House block caught fire. The fire spread with unusual speed to the rest of the complex, hitting six other towers and killing a total of 161 people.
Yesterday, also, the Chief Executive revealed the expectations he has in relation to the LegCo deputies, elected on December 7th, shortly after the fire. “I will be happy to hear your opinions, whether you agree with the Government or not,” he said.
These were the second elections since the electoral reform introduced in 2021 at the behest of Beijing, which reduced the seats elected by universal suffrage from 35 to 20, increased the weight of non-direct mechanisms and transformed the ballot into a vote in which “only patriotic (candidates)” can compete.
The vote took place without the two main pro-democracy parties: the Civic Party, dissolved in 2023, and the Democratic Party, in decline.
Head to LegCo
Although the Executive initially considered the possibility of postponing the elections after the fire and the three days of mourning and suspension of campaign activities that followed, it ended up deciding to keep them on the scheduled date.
Authorities argued that carrying out suffrage demonstrates institutional maturity and that the process can coexist with respect for victims and emergency management. In total, 161 candidates competed for 90 seats: 51 in territorial constituencies, 60 in functional constituencies and 50 designated by the Electoral Commission, dominated by profiles close to the Chinese central government.
Functional constituencies represent professional groups, commercial sectors or specific special interests and only voters registered in these sectors can vote for them, which has raised criticism for the limited representation in favor of corporate interests and elites.
"When you disagree with government policies, please point out the problems and make recommendations and suggestions. We will consider your suggestions seriously. When we are doing the right thing, please be fair to us," said Lee, as quoted by RTHK. The Chief Executive also indicated that legislators must speak based on facts and filter out misinformation when addressing the public.</description><pubDate>2026-01-15 02:28:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Trade between Brazil and China grows to record value in 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/15/comercio-entre-brasil-e-china-cresce-para-valor-recorde-em-2025/</link><description>Trade between Brazil and China grew 8.2 percent year-on-year in 2025, to a record value of 171 billion dollars, according to data released yesterday by the Brazil-China Business Council (CEBC).
China remained Brazil's main trading partner, far surpassing the United States, with which bilateral trade totaled US$83 billion in the same period. According to the CEBC, Brazil's trade surplus with China was US$29.1 billion, equivalent to 43 percent of the country's entire positive balance with the world.
The growth of Brazilian exports was driven mainly by the agricultural and extractive sector. The sale of crude oil to China alone reached a value of 20 billion dollars, with a record volume of 44 million tons – representing 45 percent of all oil exported by Brazil.
Soy exports totaled US$34.5 billion, while beef exports grew by almost 48 percent, reaching US$8.8 billion, also a record. In contrast, sales of chicken and pork fell 53 percent and 36 percent, respectively.
On the other hand
On the import side, the acquisition of a platform for oil exploration worth US$2.66 billion stood out. Hybrid car purchases also increased by 25 percent, totaling $1.87 billion. On the other hand, 100 percent electric vehicles suffered a 37 percent drop in imports.
China was also the main supplier of manufacturing goods to Brazil, with emphasis on fertilizers, chemical and pharmaceutical products, the latter with a 39 percent growth in purchases, driven especially by insulin-based medicines.
Among Brazilian states, Rio de Janeiro led exports to China for the third consecutive year, with 18.1 billion dollars, 94 percent of which came from oil sales.
With the new data, the Brazil – China trade chain represented 27.2 percent of all Brazilian foreign trade in 2025, consolidating the importance of China in the South American country's trade balance.</description><pubDate>2026-01-15 02:26:58</pubDate></item><item><title>China | Trade surplus reaches 1 billion euros in 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/15/excedente-comercial-atinge-1-biliao-de-euros-em-2025/</link><description>China's trade surplus reached a new record of almost 1.2 trillion dollars in 2025, according to data released yesterday, despite the trade war with the United States. According to data released by Chinese customs authorities, exports grew 5.5 percent in 2025, totaling 3.77 billion dollars, while imports remained practically unchanged at 2.58 billion dollars.
In 2024, the trade surplus had been US$992 billion. In December, exports increased 6.6 percent year-on-year, exceeding analysts' forecasts and the 5.9 percent growth recorded in November. Imports also rose 5.7 percent in December, compared to growth of 1.9 percent in the previous month.
Economists predict that exports will continue to be one of the main drivers of Chinese Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2026, despite trade and geopolitical tensions. “We continue to expect exports to play an important role in economic growth this year,” said Jacqueline Rong, chief China economist at BNP Paribas.
Obstacles overcome
Although exports to the United States have fallen sharply since Donald Trump's return to the White House and the intensification of the trade war with Beijing, the drop has been offset by an increase in sales to markets in South America, Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe.
Robust exports have allowed China to maintain economic growth close to the official target of 5 percent, although they have also raised concerns in other countries, which fear competition from low-priced imports for local manufacturers.
The director general of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, recently called on China to correct structural imbalances in its economy and accelerate the transition from an export-centric model to growth driven by domestic demand and investment.
The prolonged crisis in the real estate sector, following the tightening of restrictions on excessive debt, continues to affect consumer confidence and dampen domestic demand. Economist Gary Ng, from the French bank Natixis, predicts that China's exports will grow by around 3 percent in 2026, below the 5 percent recorded last year, estimating that the trade surplus will remain above 1 billion dollars this year.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Exhibition | Eric Fok shows “Dreaming of the Occident” in Taiwan: “In Portugal, I see traces of my city”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/15/exposicao-eric-fok-mostra-dreaming-of-the-occident-em-taiwan-em-portugal-vejo-vestigios-da-minha-cidade/</link><description>The year began with a new project by Eric Fok, who despite living in Portugal did not leave Macau and the East. “Dreaming of the Occident” is on display at the Helios gallery, in Taipei, and can be seen until January 24th. To HM, the local artist reveals that he wants to artistically explore the universe of Vendas Novas bifana, through its connection to Macau pork chop
How is the West represented in this exhibition?
I've always been fascinated by the intersection between Eastern and Western cultures, and I've explored how Macau was a territory shaped by Western missionaries and navigators who brought new sciences and ideas to the East. Regarding a previous exhibition, and during the research process, I realized how rare it was for the Chinese to travel to Europe at the time of the Discoveries. I read with enthusiasm the reports of the few who did so. There are diaries that vividly recreate the dangerous sea voyages and what life was like in ancient European cities. This allowed me to project myself into their stories, bridging the gap between past and present, between East and East. These cultural differences are not just history to me, but have become a rich source of imagination for my new work.
As an artist from Macau, how has the history of the territory, marked by exchange between East and West, shaped your way of thinking about this exhibition?
It all started with mapping Macau for the “Paraíso” series [2014 exhibition], a project that was born out of my curiosity about the city's past in a context of rapid expansion of the tourism and gaming industries. Through this dialogue with local history, I began to truly understand the city. I went from focusing on the small details of urban life to having a macro perspective of the world, highlighting Macau's significant role in global history. This includes its status as a gateway to China during the Discoveries, its contribution to the beginning of globalization, or even being a space for the spread of Catholicism to the East. [We cannot forget] the profound influence of maritime culture. All of these themes constitute an extension of my exploration of the historical and unique experience of Macau.
Can you describe in more detail the creative process for “Dreaming of the Occident”?
In addition to maps of Macau, this exhibition also presents maps of Eurasia and several Asian colonies, where I explore themes such as navigation, trade and empire. My research also extends to experimenting with materials. In addition to using paper and wood, I incorporated unconventional supports, such as ostrich eggs. These objects function as canvases to narrate stories about endemic species and the history of migration, establishing a bridge between a biological and historical side.
Does the exhibition intend to criticize the Western influence in Macau, reflect on it or simply observe it?
In my exploration of these themes I am mainly interested in the cultural dimensions of history. When Europeans first arrived in Asia, they viewed the world from a Eurocentric perspective. The term “Far East” was not just a geographical designation, but a symbol of power and a specific view of the world. But, on the other hand, the term “Far West” represents an initial global imagination, in the sense of being a space of mutual understanding, albeit incomplete. Today, as we live in an era of a lot of information, where connectivity is instantaneous, we have lost that sense of mystery, and my work seeks to recover a little of what is the fantasy of distance.
Do you expect different readings of the exhibition or a deeper knowledge of what Macau is, in cultural and historical terms?
In the creative process, I privilege personal expression as responses to society and the world in which we live. Although exhibiting in a commercial gallery inevitably brings a market dimension to my work, my focus is always on the integrity of the work. In recent years, my desire for the public to “correctly decode” my art has changed, in the sense that, although I feel deep satisfaction when someone connects with my inner world, I have come to accept this “emptiness” in the narrative of my work. These gaps are meant to be filled by the experiences and emotions of the viewer, or perhaps by time and history itself. In a time of rapid and ephemeral changes, I use the brush to document and preserve. My work consists of sharing the urban experience that invites the public to create an emotional connection with cities, promoting a deep reflection on identity and belonging.
He has lived between Macau and Portugal. How does this influence your work and your view of Macau’s history and culture?
At the moment I respond to this interview I find myself in Vendas Novas, a town in Portugal that is famous for bifana. I am currently exploring whether there is any direct connection between this local specialty and Macau pork chop bread. Centuries ago, the Portuguese sought to build a “home” in Macau, leaving behind Portuguese structures that defined the skyline of my city. Currently, being in Portugal, I see traces of my city everywhere. Being Asian, and being surrounded by different races and languages, I find a certain sense of belonging that can be both alienating and deeply familiar. The enormous geographical distance is shortened by culture and history, which are shared. This exchange of identities and the movement between places constitute deep inspirations for my work.
Searching for an unknown place
On the Helios gallery's internet portal, Eric Fok's new exhibition is described as a search for a Europe that, on the eastern side, was known to exist, but which was far from being known, especially from the middle of the 16th century, when the term “Taixi” appeared as a reference to the “Great West”. The Chinese expression was used by the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci and is one of the focuses of the Macau artist's work in “Dreaming of the Occident”.
According to Helios' presentation, “Taixi” was a term attributed to “an extremely distant land in the West that was, once, a blank space on maps, yet to be explored”. In this way, Eric Fok's imagined maps explore the ideas of an absent and unknown place, also analyzing “the identity of the self, the transport of memories, power and ideology”. Using historical research, the Macau artist “rediscovers ‘Taixi’ from the perspective of the Far East, through writing and cartographic representation”. Eric Fok also investigated “the views of the world that existed in the past, formed by the interconnection between power and belief”, it is described.</description><pubDate>2026-01-15 01:53:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Iranian Ambassador in Lisbon condemned “institutionalization of the improper use of force”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/14/embaixador-do-irao-em-lisboa-condenou-institucionalizacao-do-uso-indevido-da-forca/</link><description>Iran's ambassador in Lisbon, Majid Tafreshi, condemned the “institutionalization of a new policy”, implemented with the instrument of “improper use of force”, alluding to the United States and Israel. In an interview with the Lusa agency, Tafreshi warned that this process will “spread” if countries, especially Western ones, “do not take serious measures” against the United States and Israel, “which have incited public unrest”.
“There are no guarantees that such practices will not be repeated, especially when disturbing discussions are already being heard, such as those regarding the possession of Greenland”, highlighted Tafreshi, remembering the North American actions in Venezuela, and the insinuations against Colombia and Cuba.
The interview took place before the diplomat was called by the Portuguese Government because of the violent repression of demonstrations against the Iranian Government, an announcement made yesterday by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Iranian diplomat recalled having already asked his “academic colleagues” and diplomats to create in Portugal a new forum entitled “Dialogue between Enemies”, in the search for “universal peace and a world free from war and tension”, as well as the creation of new mechanisms – such as an East Asian Union – “could constitute a meaningful initiative”.
“I believe that politics and politicians should follow more closely the will of their own people, who, in reality, do not seem to have major conflicts between themselves – as can be clearly seen in tourism, in football stadiums, in concerts and in hundreds of other human interactions”, argued the Iranian diplomat.
Regarding recent developments in Iran, in which, he said, peaceful demonstrations focused on economic challenges, over time, “some elements present in these concentrations escalated to violent incidents”, including armed actions that, according to reports, “involved individuals with prior training”.
“Regrettably, these events resulted in casualties among security forces, public order forces and ordinary citizens,” said Tafreshi, after the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, condemned and demanded an end to the “repression of protests in Iran, which have resulted in more than 600 deaths since December 28, according to a non-governmental organization.
Iran's ambassador in Lisbon referred to the “millions of Iranian citizens” who participated in public demonstrations on Monday, “reflecting a change in the general picture and expressing support for their Islamic country”, which, as in the past, the news received limited attention from the Western media.
Outside incentives
Asked about what is strangling the Iranian economy, Tafreshi highlights the interventions of Israel, “to a lesser extent”, and the United States, “which have encouraged public unrest”, as well as Iran's economic challenges, which are significantly influenced by extensive sanctions imposed” by Washington.
“These measures, which Iran considers illegal, have also been supported by European countries that defend human rights, despite there being concerns that such policies have negatively affected fundamental rights of the Iranian population, including access to healthcare”, he denounced.
“Respect for the Charter of the United Nations, the bitter lessons of the First and Second World Wars and the devastating experiences and costs of events in Afghanistan, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Ukraine and elsewhere should be enough to remind us of the urgent need to prioritize, more than ever, peaceful coexistence”, he added.
Regarding the high number of fatalities, Tafreshi denied that Iranian security is using a disproportionate use of force, exemplifying, alongside the high number of deaths among civilians, the significant number of deaths and injuries among police officers”.
People power
Asked about the words of Reza Pahlavi – son of the former shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, deposed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution – in which he stated that he intends to return to Iran soon, Tafreshi considered that, with the “support of some Western and Zionist media”, he appears to be trying to play the role of a “Robin of the Woods”.
"However, Robin Hood never called on ordinary people to resort to violence or violate international norms and principles, such as attacking embassies and diplomatic facilities. During his father's reign, despite Iran having the support of the United States and the West, the country lost its 14th province, Bahrain. Based on experience, the United States supports and exploits anyone capable of harming Iran's independence and security," he responded.
Tafreshi denied, on the other hand, that the regime – “the term “regime is an illegitimate and biased expression” – is at risk, highlighting again “the millions” of Iranians who demonstrated on Monday in favor of Iran's sovereignty.
“The Islamic Republic belongs to the people of Iran. Ayatollah [Ali] Khamenei is the leader of Iran and one of those citizens”, highlighted the diplomat, for whom China and Russia maintain “good relations” with Tehran, meaning it is not necessary to count on Beijing or Moscow to defend the country, which counts on its own people to protect its security and sovereignty.</description><pubDate>2026-01-14 02:52:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Sofia Ferreira da Silva, author of a study on opera in the Mao years: “Silk Road was the biggest influence”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/07/sofia-ferreira-da-silva-autora-de-um-estudo-sobre-opera-nos-anos-de-mao-rota-da-seda-foi-a-maior-influencia/</link><description>In “Singing the Revolution: The Role of Songs and Opera in the Spread of Communism in Mao Zedong's China”, Sofia Ferreira da Silva analyzes the way in which songs and opera spread political ideals, leaving marks on the country's cultural panorama. The analysis came from the doctoral thesis in Artistic Studies, defended by the author at Universidade Nova de Lisboa
What was the musical environment like in the country before Mao Zedong came to power?
China was, and continues to be, a territory with a huge variety of practices at regional, local and ethnic levels. We can speak of four main types: music of a more erudite nature, symbolized by court music (yayue) and guqin music, more centered on Confucian ideals and with ritual functions and self-cultivation of individual morals; folk music, with vocal and instrumental genres varying according to region and ethnicity; Taoist, Buddhist and other religious music; and traditional opera, such as Kunqu and Peking, Sichuan and Canton operas, combining singing, declamation, stylized movements and martial arts. The biggest influence on Chinese music was, perhaps, the Silk Road, as a good part of the musical instruments that are now considered “Chinese”, such as the erhu, the pipa, the suona and the sanxian, have their origins in foreign instruments brought to Chinese territory, and which were gradually adapted and incorporated into their music. On the other hand, some narrative and operatic genres evolved from the adaptation and combination of counterparts from the territories crossed by this route. If it weren't for the Silk Road, traditional Chinese music would be radically different.
What other influences are there?
The other big influence is Western music. This, despite having entered the country in the 16th and 17th centuries, was felt with greater intensity from the middle of the 19th century and throughout the 20th century. The growing foreign presence and influence led to the systematic introduction of Western notation, academic training along European lines and Western classical and popular music genres, which would be assimilated in varying ways by Chinese composers, such as Ma Sicong, Li Jinhui or Xian Xinghai, combining them or not with traditional music motifs.
In the thesis, he talks about two major changes in the Mao years, with the creation of the so-called “model shows (yangbanxi)” and the revolutionary Peking operas. How did these formats help to reshape the music scene at the time?
The model shows, which include Peking operas and revolutionary songs, played an important role in reforming the Maoist musical landscape, implying changes not only in musical styles, but also in the social function of music. Production became entirely subordinated to the political project of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), resulting in the mandatory membership of artists and designated artistic associations, and the suppression, through criticism in the media, of musical elements or genres considered “feudal”, “bourgeois” or “superstitious”. In opposition, and following successive political movements and campaigns, other formats were promoted, more in line with the regime's ideals.
How, in concrete terms?
In the case of the “yangbanxi”, from the Cultural Revolution, the fact that they were called “model” implied that all new creations must strictly follow the aesthetic precepts established through them, especially the rules of the “basic task”, with the construction of revolutionary heroic figures as the ultimate aim of artistic creation. There were also the “Three Prominences”, with the attribution of greater or lesser prominence to a certain character depending on their degree of positivity or negativity, their function in the plot. These rules guided not only the narrative structure and the role of the characters, but also aspects such as the integration between music and gestures, the construction of costumes and sets, and the harmony between traditional and Western musical elements. This codification would aim, to this extent, to guarantee the ideological and aesthetic uniformity essential to the creation of a controlled, functional and politically effective musical culture within the framework of the objectives of the revolution.
What are the main political messages conveyed through these two types of shows?
The first big idea is the almost religious loyalty to Mao Zedong and the unconditional observance of his ideas. It is his thought that inspires and guides the actions of the heroes and heroic characters, the second most important category of characters in revolutionary operas, and leads them to the successful completion of the mission assigned to them or to heroic sacrifice in favor of the communist cause. The second is the class struggle as the driving force of history. We have, on the one hand, the oppressive, capitalist, imperialist and feudal class as the villain, and on the other the working people, exploited and oppressed by the former, suffering the greatest storms at their hands. The conflicts and difficult situations faced by the heroes or other positive characters, such as the death of family members, imprisonment or slavery, were always the direct expression of this struggle, and their resolution would only come from the revolutionary stance and the assumption of an active role in the construction of socialism.
And the third idea present in the shows?
This is collectivism, as a true revolutionary places the interests of the Party and the People above any individual dream or desire. No matter how prominent his role, the hero needs popular support to complete his mission: his aspirations are the aspirations of the people, and it is in solidarity between all that difficulties are overcome and the much-desired socialist harmony is achieved. Personal achievement only has value if it serves the collective cause, and individual sacrifice is glorified when it contributes to common progress. Operas promote, to this extent, a worldview where individual identity dissolves into the identity of the revolutionary collective, and where the active participation of the masses is not only desirable, but necessary.
These were years of so-called cultural Maoism, as mentioned in the thesis. How is it characterized?
Cultural Maoism presents points of contact regarding the subordination of art to politics, the valorization of the daily lives of the masses as the raw material for creation and the defense of its widespread popularization. However, it is distinguished by its emphasis on the proletarianization of the artist himself, who should abandon his position as a distant intellectual and become an active member of the working people, learning through practice and inserting himself in their daily struggles.
What are the main influences of this movement?
In addition to the Marxist-Leninist matrix, cultural Maoism would be marked by Confucian influences, giving art an ethical and formative function, as in Confucius, Mencius or Xunzi, art shaped character. However, in the Maoist context, this molding was channeled towards the construction of socialist consciousness and the eradication of traces of the bourgeois mentality. One of the central principles of this policy was the “mass line”, a kind of circular cultural dynamic in which popular ideas and expressions were collected and systematized by the Party, before being returned to the people in a clearer and more politically oriented way. Another aspect to consider is the appreciation of native and foreign cultural heritage, condensed in the maxim “use the past to serve the present, use the foreign to serve China”.
In what way?
To create new artistic works, Mao recommended the initial study of Western works, considered “scientific” and technically superior, before selectively incorporating elements of Chinese tradition. In both cases, the value of artistic forms lay in their social and political function, not in their preservation as heritage. In this context, the PCC leader proposed two criteria for artistic evaluation: the political, which required the promotion of national unity and the rejection of ideas contrary to the Party; and the artistic, which presupposed technical and aesthetic rigor following an abstract notion of “scientific criteria of art” at the service of the masses. This double requirement replaced, in Maoism, the Confucian distinction between moral quality and aesthetic quality.
In these years, what were the biggest influences on songwriting?
The composition of songs was greatly influenced by two great musical traditions: the native, with the use of regional melodies and motifs and those of the various ethnic minorities that make up the territory; and the Western, in which I include the Soviet musical tradition, most visible in marches and so-called “art songs”, which could be understood as a type of revolutionary ‘lieder’ or with highly politicized content. The influence of each of them was more or less visible depending on the political situation of the territory.
How did the years of “cultural Maoism” change the country’s musical landscape?
Some aspects of the production of Cultural Revolution operas, such as the introduction of the Western orchestra and the use of techniques from Western music, the incorporation of more realistic scenarios and the melodramatic nature of the stories influenced and continue to influence the production of new Beijing operas, especially those with contemporary or historical themes relating to the 20th century. XX. Over the last 30 years, operas with historical themes have also been produced with some of these elements, especially in terms of music and settings, such as “Cao Cao and Yang Xiu”. Some remnants of this period can also be seen in the interpretation of traditional operas, especially in the presentation of arias or excerpts on television programs. I see countless performances that combine, just like in the revolutionary repertoire, arrangements with a Western orchestra and realistic scenarios, with extensive use of new technologies. However, what I consider to be the greatest remnant of revolutionary operas will, perhaps, be a greater artistic audacity on the part of the creators of new operas. It is an issue that deserves further study by the academy, but, from my observations as a spectator, I notice a greater openness to the incorporation of elements from other arts, such as dance and theater, and a greater complexity in the characters, especially those considered negative, less antagonistic, with more nuances when it comes to motivations for acting in a certain way. It is obvious that the psychological suffering inflicted by these operas on an entire generation of Chinese people is undeniable and cannot, under any circumstances, be forgotten; however, model operas boosted the creative impetus of composers and librettists, in line with the evolutionary process, of fusion with other arts, of Peking Opera over the centuries.</description><pubDate>2026-01-07 01:10:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Alfredo Gomes Dias, historian, on Rocha Vieira: “A historical figure, whether he wanted to or not”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/20/alfredo-gomes-dias-historiador-sobre-rocha-vieira-uma-figura-historica-quer-quisesse-ou-nao/</link><description>Launched on Thursday in Porto, with the seal of War and Peace, “Macau: The Last Transition – Vasco Rocha Vieira (1991–1999)” is the result of 20 years of work by historian Alfredo Gomes Dias. The work contains personal testimonies from Rocha Vieira and documented details of the last Portuguese Administration of Macau
Another book has just been released about Rocha Vieira and the last Portuguese administration of Macau. Tell me about the beginning of this project.
This project is more or less 20 years old, and began when I met Rocha Vieira, in 2005, to write a text for the book “Governadores de Macau” [published by Livros do Oriente in 2013]. In the midst of this, I discovered that there was a personal document fund of General Rocha Vieira, while governor. As a historian, I was excited by the idea. I offered to do a project with him, which we called a “report”. All the documents were at his home, in Lagoa, where he was from. They were then deposited in a space provided by Mafra City Council and between 2007 and 2013 I worked on this documentation. It was lonely and long work, because I had to organize 1,700 boxes of documentation and combine it with my work as a teacher. Rocha Vieira kept postponing the project, saying no, but in 2016 he told me to move forward with the “report”, the book. I finished the first version in 2021. It is a committed book, in the sense that it aims to give General Rocha Vieira's vision of what his Government was like. This is not an academic work.
He had complete access to the personal file.
He gave me the green light to consult all the documentation, I had no restrictions. Rocha Vieira told me one story or another in detail, gave me guidelines and revealed to me his concerns during his government. He told me some positions he had and then the different paths they took, and the entire book is built around the many conversations I had with the general, in which I also use documentation. We have a vision of everything that happened between 1991 and 1999 and the governor's actions in the different dimensions of the Administration, at an economic, social and political level, in relations with China and Lisbon, with Hong Kong, and then everything related to the work related to the transformation of the territory, such as the birth of Cotai and the major works that were carried out. There is also talk about the transition phase and the major themes, such as the entry of Chinese troops into Macau, the ceremony and how it was organized. Today we live in an immediate world, and at today's speed it's always strange to say that this book took 20 years to make.
Can we say that this is the first time that we have such a complete testimony of Rocha Vieira's vision of his Government?
The edited biography [Vasco Rocha Vieira – Todos os Portos a que Aguei] already gives many ideas about his concerns. What I ended up doing was not focusing so much on the general's entire life, but only on the years of the Government and developing as much as possible many of the issues that Pedro Vieira raised in this biography.
What subjects are then further developed in this new work?
I describe very well all the processes linked to Macau's transition, such as the issue of laws and localization, the need to translate them into Chinese. This was a gigantic job. Then I discuss the construction of major works, the birth of Cotai. All of this based on the original plans and plans designed for Cotai, where the beginning of the idea for this area is known. Any historian who, in the future, wants to study the transition process must necessarily go through this book. I don't want to say that what's there is definitive, because it never is. But it is important to have this basis and testimony, which is enriched and substantiated by documentation.
I imagine that the controversies of the Rocha Vieira Government are also in the book. The quarrel with Jorge Sampaio, the creation of the Fundação Oriente in Portugal. What is Rocha Vieira’s testimony about these two moments?
He always maintained the same speech compared to what he had already said publicly. There is a specific chapter on Fundação Oriente, where, with the support of documentation, an attempt is made to explain the process and why Rocha Vieira, when he arrived in Macau, felt the need to solve a problem that had been dragging on and which was important to overcome. It describes how he managed to resolve it, as it was an issue that was making dialogue with the Chinese authorities difficult. It explains how Rocha Vieira interacted with the different Governments of the [Portuguese] Republic and the different Presidents, the positions he took in order to guarantee what was his responsibility. While he was at the head of the Government, Rocha Vieira always tried to assert his views, and one of the interesting things is that I had access to copies of minutes of meetings of the State Council, in which Rocha Vieira presented his vision on the situation in Macau. It's an interesting contribution. But he explains that the way he spoke with President Mário Soares was completely different from the way he spoke with Jorge Sampaio. The institutional relationship changed, the way of attending a meeting was also different. This is explained, but without going into the personal side of the dispute.
Did Rocha Vieira leave Macau with a feeling of accomplishment?
I think he left Macau very convinced, and the entire transfer ceremony ends up giving us this image that Portugal left in the best possible way. We also have to think that we are talking about two completely different countries, and that one of them is giant. And that, despite this difference, it was possible to maintain an almost equal dialogue between two States to resolve, in the best way, a specific issue that was Macau. What surprised me most about Rocha Vieira's vision was that he changed the centrality of his vision to Macau.
In what sense?
In general, the Portuguese and the authorities spoke of Macau thinking about guaranteeing the transition process without jeopardizing Portugal's interests. And General Rocha Vieira reverses the terms of the issue, that is, to guarantee Macau's interests, with the idea that guaranteeing Macau's interests would be the same as guaranteeing Portugal's interests. It looks like the same thing, but it's not. This vision, for me, was surprising.
Why?
Because it went against what was the most common discourse among the authorities and people responsible for the Portuguese administration [of Macau]. This central idea ends up changing the way he organizes his Government, how he acts and the type of actions he triggers. They all had to do with this deep conviction, that, in the remaining years, a great development of Macau would be guaranteed, the affirmation of Portuguese culture, supporting institutions, or even with the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM), whose solution ended up not being the one he proposed. It turned out to be a minimalist option.
What, specifically, was Rocha Vieira’s position?
It was to ensure that the old Macau High School was the EPM, which would give the school a completely different dimension compared to [the current location]. It has nothing to do with it. He didn't just want a Portuguese school, but also a space where it was possible to develop cultural activities, create a cultural hub in Macau linked to Portugal, and with a much more dignified option than what was, later, the option of the Ministry of Education, in the figure of Marçal Grilo, who chose [the location] of the old Commercial School. Therefore, the focus has always been to guarantee and develop Macau's interests, its autonomy, and the airport issue was fundamental to guarantee Macau's autonomy. It was also intended that Macau would adhere to international agreements regarding respect for human rights. The idea was that, by managing to guarantee Macau's interests, thinking of the territory as part of China's second system, and that if we invested a lot in Macau, we would, naturally, be defending Portuguese interests and leaving a great legacy.
What was the most complex dossier for Rocha Vieira?
I think he had great regrets regarding the Ministry of Education's option for Portuguese schools. From the conversations I had with him [that's what it seemed to me]. Then there were the security issues, with the sects, which ended up being resolved. The years 1997 and 1998 were very critical moments in Macau, but as it always had good relations with the Chinese authorities, this led to China realizing the situation, starting to collaborate more with the Portuguese authorities in Macau, in order to control the problem.
About Cotai, how did the idea come about?
It arises in the context of the airport works, when it is realized that it would be relatively easy to mobilize the land that was associated with the airport works, taking advantage of that moment to make a connection and create, essentially, a second urban center in Macau. Cotai's initial plans had to do with urban space, green and industrial spaces. The entire plan was designed to bring together different areas, social spaces, such as schools or health, as if Cotai were a mini-city, so to speak, in the territory.
But who actually had the idea?
It was an idea from Rocha Vieira's Executive, developed with secretaries. The idea came from him, when he was faced with the issue of the works, and was then developed with the team. He was always concerned about developing things with the team, also ensuring continuity with what had been done before. When he talked to me, he was careful to say: “this didn't start with me”, or that this or that secretary had been fundamental for a certain job. He never wanted to take credit that wasn't his, and this is also a great recognition from previous governors.
Therefore, Cotai was not supposed to have so much area dedicated to the game.
From what I analyzed in the documents, there was no idea of ​​giving up such a large space for entertainment, with casinos. I think the initial vision for Cotai was a little more balanced, with housing, schools, health centers, green spaces. It was supposed to be a new urban space that would be created with all the services necessary to function, it wasn't just supposed to be games.
The moments in which Rocha Vieira clutches the flag to his chest, moved, will go down in history. Did he remember those moments with you?
Yes, but despite the historical dimension of his role, Rocha Vieira was not exactly aware of the historical role he was playing. He was there with a clear mission and objectives, without really thinking about the role he could have in the future. Once, when we were having lunch, I told him that we could put our work into perspective, but that he was going to become a historical figure in the history of Portugal, whether he wanted to or not. And the funny thing is that he looked at me with a face like he had never thought of that, with a very surprised look. In fact, it is unthinkable to take away his status as the last Portuguese governor in Macau in hundreds of years of history. On top of that, he was there for a long period [9 years], when most governors were there for three or four years.</description><pubDate>2025-12-20 04:01:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist activist, 34 years old, physical engineer, Romani national. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied this right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on staying, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
What are you talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Davis Cup | Tiago Pereira makes his national team debut with China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/09/taca-davis-tiago-pereira-estreia-se-pela-seleccao-com-a-china/</link><description>Tiago Pereira is the new addition to the national tennis team for the Davis Cup match with China, on February 6th and 7th, which also includes Nuno Borges, Francisco Cabral, Jaime Faria and Henrique Rocha, it was announced yesterday. “Tiago Pereira has been improving a lot and, in recent months, he has obtained good results not only in singles but also in doubles, which makes him an option for both variants”, said captain Rui Machado about the debutant.
In addition to the 21-year-old Algarvian, ranked 265th in the world rankings, Rui Machado's bet was on Nuno Borges (45th) and Francisco Cabral (20th), the best Portuguese tennis players today in singles and doubles, respectively, in addition to Henrique Rocha (157th) and Jaime Faria (151st).
Portugal has not competed at home since September 2022, then against Brazil, and the visiting condition has been favorable, but Rui Machado is confident in the group he will take to China.
“We are aware that it will be a very difficult tie against a team with experienced players, with a lot of potential and who have already proven that they can play at a very high level”, he considered, without knowing his counterpart Di Wu's chosen ones. Portugal will visit China in the play-off of Group I of the Davis Cup in tennis, in which they will try to avoid relegation to Group II, where they have not been since 2015.</description><pubDate>2026-01-09 02:28:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Nuno Borges advances to the quarter-finals after beating Marin Cilic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/08/hong-kong-nuno-borges-segue-para-os-quartos-de-final-apos-bater-marin-cilic/</link><description>Portuguese number one Nuno Borges qualified yesterday for the quarter-finals of the Hong Kong Open in tennis after beating Croatian Marin Cilic in two partials.
The first half was more balanced, with the player from Maia, 47th in the ATP rankings, being the first to break the serve of the 37-year-old veteran, number 70 in the world. The winner of the US Open in 2014 still responded in kind, but Borges once again broke the Bosnian veteran's game to win the first partial 7-5.
The Portuguese started the second set better, winning the first three games, an advantage he maintained to close the partial at 6-3 and win the match after just 47 minutes. In the quarter-finals, Borges will face the winner of the match between the tournament's third seed and 16th in the world, the 28-year-old Russian Andrey Rublev, and the 26-year-old Chinese Wu Yibing, number 179 in the world, who came from qualifying.
Borges is the eighth seed in the tournament in the Chinese region, which also serves as preparation for the Australian Open – one of the four Grand Slams, the main tournaments in world tennis – which starts on January 12th.
In the 2025 season, the maiato beat, for the first time in his career, a top 10 player, world number eight, Norwegian Casper Ruud, in the second round of Roland Garros, in May. Borges also reached the fourth round at the Australian Open, in January 2025, and at the United States Open, in August, and was also the first Portuguese to reach the round of 16 of the Masters 1,000 in Shanghai, China, in October.</description><pubDate>2026-01-08 01:19:09</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Rui Valente questions staying in motorsport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/17/gp-rui-valente-questiona-permanencia-no-automobilismo/</link><description>Rui Valente had a 72nd Macau Grand Prix to forget. To the point that the driver with the most years of activity in motorsport in the territory seriously admits the possibility of hanging up his helmet and putting away his gloves, or, at least, stopping competing in Macau's premier race, be it the Macau Roadsport Challenge or even the entire event.
 
 
“There are a number of factors that lead me to question whether it makes sense to continue,” Rui Valente told HM. The experienced Touring car driver points out several reasons for this reflection, namely “the fact that Grand Prix races are of much less interest today, as they are almost always contested behind the Safety Car, the current scoring system for Macau qualification and the attitude of some drivers on the track”.
The most recent edition of the Grand Prix did not leave good memories for those who made their debut at the Guia Circuit in 1988. The Macau Roadsport Challenge weekend started negatively for the Portuguese driver, who did not avoid touching the rails in the Paiol area during free practice on Thursday, an incident that affected his entire performance. After achieving the 25th best time in the qualifying session, misfortune manifested itself again in the race, when the recovery attempt at the controls of the #16 Subaru BRZ ended prematurely on the approach to the São Francisco Curve. On the restart after the first Safety-Car, Rui Valente was hit by Li Kwok Chuen, in a maneuver in which the Hong Kong driver attempted to overtake on the inside, in a place where there was no available space.
"Even today I can't understand what went through his head. I don't know how he saw a space that simply didn't exist. Maybe he thought I was going to lift my foot to let him pass", recalled the driver, who has thirty-six participations in the Macau Grand Prix and was one of the nine representatives of the Macao SAR in the 2025 edition of the Macau Roadsport Challenge.
 
Qualification lottery
Rui Valente has been one of the most critical voices of the current qualifying model for the Grand Prix, which mainly benefits those who finish one of the races in the top ten. The use of identical vehicles by all competitors, Toyota GR86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8), accentuates the balance of movement on the track. Added to this factor is the fact that only four races count towards qualification and that the grids often have more than three dozen participants, transforming each race into an authentic “pitched battle”, in which the objective is to achieve a top result in a single race to guarantee the points necessary to be on the starting grid for the event in November.
“With so many cars on the track at the same time, there are many drivers under enormous pressure to score points, which ends up causing a high number of incidents”, admits the Portuguese driver. “In this way, the qualification is closer to a lottery than a process truly based on merit”, adds the Premium Racing Team representative.
On the other hand, Rui Valente recognizes that younger people are the main losers. With experience clearly superior to that of newcomers, who have fewer kilometers of track and less competitive experience, the driver emphasizes, even so, that the difficulty is not restricted to newcomers. "Even for those who have been racing for many years, like me, qualifying is extremely complicated. If this is the case for the more experienced, it becomes clear that young people end up being the most penalized by this model", he concluded.
 
Próximo passo
As for the future, Rui Valente – who received the award for third place among Macau drivers in Group A of the MTCS Macau Roadsport Challenge, at the 2025 Awards Ceremony of the General Automobile Association of Macau-China – has not yet made a definitive decision. The alternatives on the table include remaining in competition along the same lines, considering a change of category, an option conditioned by budgetary limitations, or, ultimately, putting an end to their participation in the Grand Prix, or even their career.
The second driver with the most participations in the history of the Macau Grand Prix, just behind Albert Poon, confesses that he has not lost his love for motorsport, an activity that keeps him in excellent physical shape at 64 years old. However, he admits that "perhaps it's time to leave Macau. It's a shame, because I really like this. In fact, the problem is that I like this a lot."</description><pubDate>2026-01-17 01:56:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Coloane | Kartódromo hosts the Champions of the Future Academy Program</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2026/01/09/coloane-kartodromo-recebe-o-champions-of-the-future-academy-program/</link><description>The Coloane Kartdrome will start the year at high speed, hosting from the 16th to the 18th of January the first edition in the territory of the new Champions of the Future Academy Program competition, organized and promoted by the Swiss company RGMMC Group
The Champions of the Future Academy Program is an international Arrive and Drive karting competition designed to develop the next generation of motorsport talent. According to the promoter, the event is aligned “with FIA sporting standards and combines elite competition with comprehensive training for drivers, offering young people the experience and international visibility necessary to launch professional careers, while keeping costs under control”.
With three competitive categories — Mini, OK-N Junior and OK-N Senior — the concept aims to bring together emerging talents from around the world to compete in world-class events. According to the organization, this event in Macau “aims to expand the Champions of the Future Academy Program to national series”, reinforcing the presence of the concept outside its main calendar.
In addition to the event in Macao, RGMMC, founded in 2004, also has a non-championship event planned in the United Arab Emirates in February. The regular championship consists of six stages, taking place between February and December, with visits to Spain, Greece, Italy, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The same entity also promotes a series along the same lines in the United Kingdom.
The Champions of the Future Academy Program Macau, which has the support of the General Automobile Association of Macau-China (AAMC) and the MSAR Sports Institute, will take place over three competitive days, with two final races that determine the classification of the event winner for each category. The paddock will open to teams on Thursday, followed by a full day of free practice on Friday, while timed training and racing will take place on Saturday and Sunday.
Equal for everyone
Each category admits a maximum of 24 competitors, a limit that remains the same in all events. The Mini Group 3 category, aimed at drivers between 9 and 12 years old, will use Parolin chassis and TM engines, with a registration cost of approximately 32,750 patacas. The OK-N Junior categories, for ages between 12 and 14, and OK-N Senior, for ages 14 and 17, will compete with Kart Republic chassis and IAME engines, with the registration fee being around MOP42,125 per weekend.
As the name Arrive &amp; Drive indicates, these values ​​include the kart and its engine, space in the tent, necessary tools, tires — supplied in all classes by LeCont Pneumatici —, fuel, lubricants and all associated logistics. This way, drivers can focus exclusively on driving and, thanks to mechanical equality, competitive and lively races can be expected at one of the best kart tracks in Southeast Asia.
In 2026, the Coloane Kartódromo will have a particularly busy calendar. In addition to the karting and motorcycling competitions organized by the AAMC, the route designed by architect Carlos Couto will host the Chinese Karting Championship, on the 11th and 12th of April, the IAME Series Asia, on the weekend of the 23rd and 24th of May, and the Macau International Karting Grand Prix, scheduled for the period between the 11th and 14th of December.</description><pubDate>2026-01-09 02:34:46</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Date and two competitions confirmed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/12/gp-data-e-duas-competicoes-confirmadas/</link><description>The final meeting of the 2025 FIA World Motor Sport Council took place last Wednesday, during FIA General Assembly Week, in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The session was attended by delegates from the various National Sports Authorities (ASNs), from which important decisions were taken, some of which concern Macau
The date of the 73rd Macau Grand Prix has been officially revealed, confirming that the Macao SAR's biggest annual sporting event will take place from 19 to 22 November next year. The international federation also took the opportunity to announce that the date and location of the ninth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup, which has been contested at the Guia Circuit since its creation, as part of the Grand Prix program, have been approved by the GT Commission. The same entity did not reveal the guidelines for next year's race, which in this year's edition only featured sixteen competitors, but this is the first time it has confirmed it so early.
For its part, the Touring Car Commission confirmed the calendar for the next season of the Kumho TCR World Tour, which will once again end at the Guia Circuit, as in previous years. China's strong presence on the calendar stands out: the Macau and Zhuzhou races are joined by an absolute debut, the new Chengdu Tianfu International Circuit. With eight events – one in Mexico and three in Europe, including the visit to the Vila Real International Circuit -, Asia gains new importance with a total of four rounds.
Four of the 2026 Kumho TCR World Tour events will maintain the traditional two-race format, including Macau, while the remaining four – Mexico, Spain (Valencia), South Korea (Inje) and China (Chengdu) – will adopt the three-race-per-weekend format introduced last year, reaching a total of twenty races in the season.
The FIA ​​World Motor Sport Council has not publicly commented on the continuation, or not, of the Formula Regional (FR) and Formula 4 World Cups in the Macau Grand Prix program, even though the latter's project, which also involves the Chinese promoter Mintime and the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile (FFSA), was designed for three years.
Also bet on karting
The World Council also approved the regulations that support the expansion of Karting under the supervision of the FIA, at a time when the next phase of implementation of the “Global Karting Plan” begins, which, next year, will integrate new “Arrive &amp; Drive” championships, included in one of the most extensive calendars ever.
Following the auspicious start of the FIA ​​“Arrive &amp; Drive” Karting World Cup, held in Malaysia last month, the innovative format will be expanded with new continental championships, bringing these accessible and affordable events closer to communities around the world. The 2026 calendar, already approved, will feature a European Championship and an Asia-Pacific Championship, each consisting of three rounds, the winners of which will secure a place on the 2026 FIA “Arrive &amp; Drive” Karting World Cup grid, to be contested at the end of the season.
The Coloane Kart Track, still one of the most modern in Southeast Asia, will be part of this first edition of the “Arrive &amp; Drive” Asia-Pacific Championship, hosting the inaugural race on the weekend of June 20th and 21st. The calendar of this low-cost competition also includes two other stages: one in Zhuzhou, in Hunan Province, and another in Madras, India.</description><pubDate>2025-12-12 01:19:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau | Rosa Mota in second place in the minimarathon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/09/macau-rosa-mota-em-segundo-lugar-na-minimaratona/</link><description>The Portuguese Rosa Mota came second on Sunday in the Macau mini-marathon, a 4.5-kilometer race that is part of the International Marathon in the Chinese region. The 67-year-old former Olympic champion finished the race in 17 minutes and 10 seconds, 54 seconds more than the first, local athlete Kin I Chao.
In February, the Portuguese woman was discharged from hospital, following a planned surgical intervention, after overcoming a “serious problem”, a “dissecting aortic aneurysm”. Rosa Mota, born in Porto, was Olympic marathon champion at the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988, after having won bronze in Los Angeles in 1984. Her achievements also include three European titles (1982, 1986 and 1990) and one world title (1987).
She is still the national marathon record holder, with a time of 02.23.29 hours, a mark achieved in Chicago in 1985. In recent years, Rosa Mota had reappeared at the highest level and won several veteran races, having set in Barcelona, ​​in 2024, the world half-marathon record (1:24.27 hours), for the 65 to 69 age group.
Also last year, the Portuguese won the Macau mini-marathon, repeating the triumphs in 2018, 2019 and 2023. This year, the organization invited several athletes, nominated by the Association of Portuguese Language Olympic Committees (ACOLOP), from Portugal, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sri Lanka and the state of Goa (India).
Lusophony highlighted
Lusophones were in the spotlight in the half-marathon, with Cape Verdean Samuel Freire, from Sporting Clube de Portugal, finishing third in the men's race, behind winner Martin Ndungu and David Kipkorir Rono, both Kenyans.
In fourth place came the Portuguese Fábio Oliveira, 30th in the marathon of the first edition of the European Road Championships, in April, and part of the Portugal team that finished in fourth place. Soon after came the young Mozambican Pinto Victor Jequecene, aged 22, while Angolan David Jundo Elias finished in seventh place.
In the women's race, Angolan Lúcia Kawele Capingala came in third place, behind the winner, Kenyan Lucy Ndambuki, and Chinese Na Zhao. Already off the podium, in fourth position, finished the young Portuguese Joana Ferreira, who won the silver medal in the under-23 race of the national athletics championships in 10 thousand meters, in May.
Mozambican Domingas Ernesto Checane came in sixth place. Around 12 thousand participants signed up for the three races of the Macau International Marathon, with the title of the premier race going to Kenyan Victor Kipchirchir and Ethiopian Senay Mastewal Birhanu.
In addition to his triumph, Kipchirchir broke the Macau marathon record, finishing in two hours, nine minutes and 27 seconds, 34 seconds less than the previous record, set in 2017 by Ethiopian Felix Kiptoo Kirwa.</description><pubDate>2025-12-09 03:18:38</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
