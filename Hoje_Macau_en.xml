In practice, the measure aims mainly to “canola”, a plant developed in Canada, related to the colza and used, namely, to produce food oil and feed for animals. The US country is one of the world's leading producers and China is one of its main customers.
Last year, Canada announced the imposition of additional customs rights on certain products manufactured in China: 100 percent on electric vehicles and 25 percent on steel and aluminum products. Beijing promised to react, but at the time expressed his firm opposition to these measures, considering them protectionists.
A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Trade declared on Saturday that an anti-discrimination inquiry launched on September 26 concluded that Canadian taxes “damaged” Chinese companies and “affected the normal order of commerce”, which led China to retaliate.
"Added customs rights of 100 percent to colza oil, oilseeds and peas will be applied," said the Chinese government customs customs agenda in a separate statement. A 25 percent surcharge will also be imposed on water products and pork. These customs rights will come into force on 20 March.
Unstable relationships
"Canadian measures constitute a serious violation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, are clearly protectionists and discriminate against China," the commission said.
"China urges Canada to immediately correct its bad practices, raise its restrictive measures and eliminate its negative effects," the Ministry of Commerce stressed in the press release. Canadian surcharges apply to cars produced in China, trucks, buses, electric distribution vans and certain hybrid models.
Relations between Otava and Beijing have been in conflict for several years, notably since the Huawei crisis and the detention in 2018 of Meng Wanzhou, the Chinese group's financial director, followed by arrest in China of two Canadians.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:27:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Health | Song Pek Kei asks for more formations for nurses</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/saude-song-pek-kei-pede-mais-formacoes-para-enfermeiros/</link><description>To face the search for more and better health care, Mrs Song Pek Kei requested additional incentives for the formation of new nurses.

The show, entitled “Above Zobeida: Art of Macao at the 60th International Art Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia” is available at the Macao Art Museum (MAM), and was inaugurated last Friday.
The project, by local artist Wong Weng Cheong, is inspired by Italo Calvino's “As Invisible Cities”. According to a note from the Cultural Institute (IC), it is a "a must-see exhibition that explores global issues from the perspective of Macao, questioning the identity in a heterotopy."
Leong Wai Man, president of the IC, declared, at the inauguration of the exhibition, that the participation of the territory in this Biennial in Venice aimed to "show Macau to the world", with "the creations of young participants in a skillfully mixed marks of everyday life in Macao with their experiences of study abroad, proposing a unique interpretation of the city's culture."
In Italo Calvino's novel, Zobeida is the name of the fictional city.

The action brought in Hong Kong aims to pay costs and expenses of representation in a judicial process against the executor of Winnie Ho, Stanley Ho's deceased sister
 
Almost five years after Stanley Ho's death, court proceedings that arrive at the Hong Kong and Macau courts resulting from family disputes involving the tycoon of the tycoon.
According to Bloomberg agency, the latest court episode concerns the process brought by Stanley Ho's assets against 18 descendants of the tycoon to ensure the payment of costs and expenses arising from the representation of HO in another judicial process involving the dismissal of his late sister Winnie Ho.
Among the processed individuals, which include their children, highlighting President MGM China Holdings Ltd Pansy Ho and the founder of Nip Group Inc Mario Ho, as well as several grandchildren of SJM founder Holdings.
This last action was brought on Hong Kong by Patrick Cowley and Lui Yee Man from KPMG Advisory (Hong Kong) Ltd, Stanley Ho's heritage administrators. The pair of representatives are asking the court to grant them the right to defend Stanley Ho's assets in a judicial case against the Winnie Ho Heritage Executor, who died in 2018. In addition, compensation is requested to cover expenses and other costs.
Fraternal rivalry
In 2019, Winnie Ho's property executor sued Stanley Ho, his older sister Nanette Ho and the Macao Tourism and Entertainment Society (STDM) that controls the family's casino business.
The process that ran in the Macao courts was based on the non -payment of dividends for more than a decade for STDM actions, which was managed several years by Stanley and Winnie. Dividends ascend to at least $ 1 billion from Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg News based on records.
At the turn of the century, with the end of the game monopoly in Macao and the creation of the concession system to explore industry in the territory, the two brothers were involved in an unprecedented struggle. Since 2006, Winnie Ho has established more than 30 cases in Macao and Hong Kong courts against Stanley Ho, related to debt, defamation cases or disputes on the property of social stakes in companies.
Stanley Ho was 98 when he died in 2020. He was the father of 17 children with different women, which gave rise to an extensive and complex family tree that culminated in a series of court disputes. He passed away without leaving a will and, given the impossibility of the family, reaching an agreement, a court eventually nominated the administrators of the Magnata's heritage, who has now sued the heirs.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:09:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Natural Gas | FINANCING REQUEST TO INCREASE SAFETY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/gas-natural-pedido-financiamento-para-aumentar-seguranca/</link><description>Recent fires led deputy Si Ka Lon to suggest greater implementation of natural gas supply, for safety reasons and also as part of environmental policies
 
Deputy Si Ka Lon advocates the widening of repair fund subsidies to the installation of pipes for the use of natural gas in housing buildings. The position was taken in a written interpellation, released on Friday.
After two fires occur in the last two weeks, which caused seven injuries, the deputy came to defend the need to adopt more security measures to avoid further occurrences. And one of the suggested measures is funded by the installation of natural gas distribution pipes in buildings: “Given the recent fires at TOI SAN and mud, which is suspected that at least one of the cases is related to a gas leakage, which shows the existing risks, the authorities are intended to accelerate the study to launch more security measures, such as the widening of building repair funding?” Lon.
Another of the deputy issues linked to the Fujian community indicates the need to “increase the level of knowledge of the population about natural gas” and promote greater use, given the benefits at the level of safety. “Will the government bet more on natural gas […] and the greatest use in Macau?” He asked.
The deputy points out that the natural gas distribution system is currently available in the territory, but that "it is mainly concentrated in the new public housing buildings or dealership hotels." Therefore, SI calls for an update of the numbers about the use of natural gas.
Willingness
As part of the explanations for the low implementation of natural gas, which by 2022 had 10,000 users, the legislator indicates that owners tend not to pay for installation works: “Small owners are usually not available to do the natural gas installation works, due to the high initial costs and the unclear return,” he explained. "The necessary incentive measures are urgent for more residents to benefit from natural gas safety," he said.
At the argument of security, Si Ka Lon also joins the importance of reducing carbon emissions, according to the environmental plans of MSAR.
In this sense, the deputy asks if there are plans for the proportion of the energy acquired to Zhuhai come from non -fossil sources. “Currently, the proportion of non -fossil energy in the electricity acquired by Macau is greater than 40 percent. Authorities stated that before the contract ended in 2026 that there will be discussions to 'gradually increase the percentage'. When will the negotiation be done? ”He asked.
Si Ka Lon also wants to know if there are goals set for five or 10 years, about reducing the proportion of imported energy generated by fossil fuels.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:07:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Maternity License | Associations ask for extension to 90 days</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/licenca-de-maternidade-associacoes-pedem-extensao-para-90-dias/</link><description>Faced with the reduction of birth, workers and residents asked the chief executive better conditions for mothers and fathers, as well as increased flexibility in housing policies
 
The General Federation of Macao Workers asked the government to extend the maternity leave in the private sector of current 70 days to 90 days.
According to TDM Macau, the association's vice president also defended an extension of the paternity license, currently fixed in five days. Leong Men Ian also appealed to reinforce the financial support given to his parents. Currently, the government assigns 5,418 patacas to the parents of each newborn. On the other hand, Leong said authorities should allow couples to live in public housing to move to a larger apartment after they have children.
The leader was speaking in the presentation of an inquiry into the living conditions of women in Macau, whose results show that 73 percent are concerned about employment prospects and 48 percent with care for children and the elderly.
Also Deputy Ho Ion Sang, vice president of the General Union of Macao Residents Associations, questioned the government about plans to increase maternity and paternity licenses.
On February 20, Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam Vai Man, promised to allow residents in public housing to move to a larger apartment to encourage birth.
The new chief executive of Macao, who took office in late December, admitted during the election campaign that one of the biggest long -term challenges is low birth.
Low of birth
Sam Hou Fai said it is necessary to “create conditions in terms of education and employment” to rise birth and promised to study the extension of maternity leave and the creation of a compulsory central action fund.
Macau registered in 2024 only 0.58 births per woman, the lowest fertility rate provided that the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services began to compile this data in 2000, and far from the value needed to replace generations (2,1).
The fertility rate is even lower than the estimate made in a report released in July by the United Nations Economic and Social Affairs Department (UNDESA): 0.68 births per woman.
Although more optimistic, the Undesa estimate already indicated that Macau would have had the lowest fertility in the world, at a great distance from the second jurisdiction in the list, Singapore, with 0.95 births per woman. Official data show that there were 3,607 births in Macau last year, the lowest number for almost two decades.
In late January, the Deputy Director of Health Services, Kuok Cheong U, predicted that there should be less than 3,500 births in the region in 2025, a number that would be the lowest since 2004.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:03:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Women's Day | Government praises progress towards equality</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/dia-da-mulher-governo-enaltece-progresso-rumo-a-igualdade/</link><description>On International Women's Day, the Government praised advances in access to work, education, health and participation in the public sphere. The difference in wages between men and women in 2023 was 2 percent, below the OECD average. In the highest positions of administration, Macau is moving towards equality, and in the judiciary women are the majority
 
On Saturday, the International Women's Day was celebrated, with the Government of Manda to mark the advances of the female condition in the territory since the transfer of Portuguese administration.
The Institute of Social Action (IAS) has summarized the policies and social progress of Macau women in access to medical care, education, employment, safety and social perks in more than two decades.
"With regard to employment, with a high level of education of women from Macao and the friendly policy of child care mechanism, the rate of women's workforce participation increased from 56.1 (in 1999) to 65.2 percent (in 2023)," the body led by Hon Wai. IAS states that in addition to the 9.1 percent increase in women's labor participation rate between 1999 and 2023, the difference for men reduced 20.3 percentage points to 6 percentage points in the period under analysis.
In addition to the biggest presence in the labor market, in 2023 the difference in salaries in Macau was 2 percent, still with men earning more. However, the government emphasizes that the salary difference in the territory is lower than the average value compared to the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
In the chapter of participation in public affairs, still in 2023, the proportion of women in the civil service in Macao was 44.9 percent, while the proportion of women in positions of direction and leadership stood at 40.7 percent. In the local judiciary, 51.3 of the territory judges are women, while in the government led by Sam Hou Fai there are three women among the nine holders of the main positions, or 33.3 percent. An organ where a lack of female representation is denoted, and the government has not mentioned, is in the Legislative Assembly where only five women count on a cast of 33 deputies, that is, men form almost 85 percent of the hemicicle.
Other spheres
Prior to entering the labor market and the demand for professional achievement, IAS highlights female evolution in access to education, starting by mentioning that implementation for 15 years of free education policy is an opportunity for both genres. But analyzing the situation more deepened, IAS indicates that in the school year 2023/2024, the university's access rate was 97.5 percent, more than 0.5 percentage points higher than men. “The proportion of the retention of academic qualification of women's higher education courses increased from 6.1 (in 2001) to 30.6 percent (in 2021)”, an increase of 24.5 percentage points in 20 years, adds IAS.
Another high asset, it is concerned with day care centers for children under 3 years old, which is over 60 percent, "much higher than the average value of the care rate access rate of the OECD countries."
In the health level, IAS states that “the maternal mortality rate has been at a low level for over 10 years. Women's life expectancy went from 80.5 years of age (in 1999) to 86.1 (in 2024) ”, superior to that of men.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 03:58:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Debbie Lai, director of the center of the good shepherd | “Victims need more protection”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/debbie-lai-directora-do-centro-do-bom-pastor-vitimas-precisam-de-mais-proteccao/</link><description>Regarding International Women's Day, which was celebrated around the world on Saturday, HM talked to Debbie Lai, director of the center of the good shepherd, one of the entities that welcomes victims of domestic violence in the territory. The official defends speed in investigations of cases of domestic violence and more days of maternity leave
 
 
Regarding domestic violence, the law remains not revised, with many cases where it cannot be accused or condemned the aggressor. What needs to be changed in current legislation?
You should accelerate the time spent in investigating the case, as well as to make a simple promotion of the law, to let people understand what they will face if they report the situation to the police. There is still afraid of the complaint to the police, so what happens is that the aggressor, before a complaint, gets angry, again committing violence and the family is departed.
How many women are currently at the center of the good shepherd?
According to the License of Service granted by the Institute of Social Action (IAS), we can welcome 14 people, including children. We currently have 11 people, six women, three children and two girls living in our center. Some of these women have problems due to emotional conflicts, and although they already have some stability at this level, they continue to have financial difficulties. Many of these women are not permanent residents, so they are unable to apply for government social housing, and they need more time to save money to pay an income in Macao, which is not cheap. If young children exist, it is harder for them to find a full -time job, so these women cannot move in a short time for a home, staying in our center a year. And in this situation, the center cannot have more empty rooms to help other women in crisis.
Do you consider that more reception centers are needed for victims of violence in Macao, or more resources to ensure the victim's safety, since the territory is so small?
I think the resources are sufficient, but the investigation process is time consuming. Victims need more protection, as there is always the risk that the perpetrator continues to threaten them.
What is necessary to increase the birth rate and ensure that women continue to have access to equal economic and employment opportunities?
Promotion needs to be continuous, and should increase maternity leave, as in other countries there are more maternity leave. The monthly value of day care centers could also be decreased. The attribution of a subsidy by each child could also be considered if the family has financial problems.
There is a lack of support for single -padded families, where women are alone with dependent children, or where women are caregivers? In concrete terms, what needs to be improved?
I think yes. I think some of them do not know that there are resources in society to help them, or may not have motivation to seek help. Many of these women also do not want to rely on government, not even non -governmental associations or organizations that provide services to the family. But these women can always apply for the subsidy attributed by the Institute of Social Action, which gives them some money and allows you to stay at home to take care of their children.
How do you describe women in Macao currently, especially the Chinese community? Are you more emancipated and equal to men regarding their rights?
Nowadays the capacity of women has changed a lot, as they have equal opportunities and the right to develop. Many local companies are already chaired by women, for example. In addition to having physical strength, they can choose their jobs, attend higher education, marry and have the ability to take leadership positions. However, there are many women who come to Macau and marry residents and have a lower social position, suffering from various family problems. I speak of machismo that still exists, the addiction of the game, situations of toxicodependence or lack of communication. There are men who control everything, creating a climate in which the wife has to hear her husband and is devoid of self-esteem to get out of this situation. In such cases, it is very easy to have discussions, conflicts and even cases of violence between the couple. These are situations that obviously also affect their children.
International Women's Day celebrated in Macau
International Women's Day was celebrated in Macao in very diverse ways. In the case of Sands China, flowers were offered to the operator's workers as a way of expressing “the appreciation for the indispensable contributions that women make in the workplace, in the family and society”, can read in a company statement. It was also organized a debate that focused on the issues around women, organized by the Sands Empowher volunteer team, a “global initiative of diversity and inclusion led by women, which aims to connect the team's female members to create network job opportunities”. This event was broadcast live on Sands China's various digital platforms.
Sands Empowher is, above all, to organize training and mentoring actions so that women can develop in professional and career terms.
In the same note, it states that the company “is committed to building and maintaining a workplace with respect and equality”, defending and guaranteeing women's rights. Regarding sexual harassment, Sands states that it has carried out a campaign to prevent cases since July 2018, as well as actions that reduce cases of discrimination against women.
This was “the first in Macao”, and a “training action with all team members” on these themes was also carried out. Regarding support for maternity, "the company also offers breastfeeding rooms for mothers and performs a wide variety of activities for parents and children to promote family harmony."
At the Portuguese School of Macao, International Women's Day was celebrated on Friday with the DAC project-“Women who inspire”, an initiative organized by the teachers of the disciplines of Portuguese, Philosophy and Mathematics, among others. The 10th grade students have developed several works on inspiring women in the most diverse areas. One of them was the recently deceased poet Maria Teresa Horta.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 03:54:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Canada | Beijing imposes rates on agricultural products</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/canada-pequim-impoe-tarifas-sobre-produtos-agricolas/</link><description>Beijing announced on Saturday the imposition of additional customs rights on various Canadian agricultural products, including 100 percent on Colza oil, in retaliation for the imposition by ota in 2024 of taxes on electric vehicles produced in China.

The purpose of this celebration is that everyone can have fun equally, without distinctions. Holi is one of the oldest celebrations in India, based on Hindu mythologies such as the legend of Krishna and Radha and a love that, at the outset, would be hard to realize due to the differences in the skin of both lovers. However, Krishna decided to paint her face in various colors to get the same color as her beloved, so that they could be together.
Traditionally, on the eve of the festival, it is customary to gather branches or dried leaves, building bonfires to ward off the evil spirits and energies. When, the next morning, the heat goes out, it is time to start celebration on the streets, with colors, dances and joy, in which people launch the colorful powders.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:21:37</pubDate></item><item><title>APN | National Legislature holds 2nd Plenary Meeting</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/apn-legislatura-nacional-realiza-2-a-reuniao-plenaria/</link><description>The third session of the 14th National Popular Assembly (APN), the China National Legislature, held its second plenary meeting on Saturday to deliberate on working reports of the 14th APN, the Supreme Popular Court (STP) and Supreme Popular Attorney (SPP).
Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders, including Li Qiang, Wang Huning, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, Li Xi and Han Zheng, attended the meeting, the People's Diary. Zhao Leji, chairman of the APN Permanent Committee, presented the National Legislature's work report at the meeting.
Reviewing the work of the highest legislature in 2024, Zhao highlighted his commitment to strengthen the implementation of the Constitution and increase the supervision of compliance to maintain the authority and inviolability of the Constitution.
Regarding the use of its legislative functions to improve the Chinese socialist legal system, the national legislature deliberated on 39 legislative items last year, of which 24 were adopted, including six new laws and 14 laws revised, Zhao said. The national legislature legally exercised its duty of supervision, said Zhao, adding that he listened and decided on 21 reports from the State Council, the National Supervision Commission, STP and SPP.
Zhao mentioned that the national legislature also intensified efforts to support legislators in fulfilling their duties according to the law, including helping legislators to maintain narrow ties with the people.
By presenting the Supreme Court's work report, STP President Zhang Jun said Chinese courts at all levels accepted more than 46 million cases and completed more than 45 million cases by approximately the same level as the previous year.
Zhang said that the courts in 2025 will make new and further contributions to promote law -based governance on all fronts and build a socialist country under the rule of law at a higher level.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:15:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Government enhances sensitization for burles abroad</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/07/governo-realca-sensibilizacao-para-burlas-no-estrangeiro/</link><description>Continues the government's prevention campaign to alert the population to the dangers of crime organized abroad and the Southeast Asia centers. The Director of Tourism Services (STD), Helena de Senna Fernandes, compiled the work of various departments of administration, and police forces, raising awareness of the danger of organized crime networks dedicated to telephone and cyber circums.
In response to an interpellation by Deputy Leong Hong Sai, Helena de Senna Fernandes states that “to sensitize Macau residents to take into account when they move abroad,” STD distributed, through travel agency associations, information leaflets and produced a video with safety tips for outside travel. These materials recommend to residents the prior planning of itineraries, contract travel insurance, preparation for the various types of payment used on site, keep passports in safe places and maintain contact with family and friends during the trip. The guardian also highlights the importance of residents becoming aware of the risks they can find.
In addition, it is stressed that the government has an internet page that launches travel and information alerts, “including those provided by the China Popular Republic Embassy in Thailand, warning Chinese citizens” to the importance of care to be taken before traveling abroad.
Informative combat
Helena de Senna Fernandes mentions an extended network of administrative entities, in addition to STD, such as the directions of Justice and Youth Education and Education Services and the Judicial Police (PJ), which has warned of the danger of these organized crime networks.
The official stresses a PJ-organized press conference in December last year, which aimed to spread information on the subject, as well as “sending anti-mood messages through official police social networking accounts” appealing to public surveillance. An awareness campaign was also launched in the school network to sensitize parents and students to the danger of fraudulent schemes.</description><pubDate>2025-03-07 03:12:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>Beijing announced on Saturday the imposition of additional customs rights on various Canadian agricultural products, including 100 percent on Colza oil, in retaliation for the imposition by ota in 2024 of taxes on electric vehicles produced in China.
In practice, the measure aims mainly to “canola”, a plant developed in Canada, related to the colza and used, namely, to produce food oil and feed for animals. The US country is one of the world's leading producers and China is one of its main customers.
Last year, Canada announced the imposition of additional customs rights on certain products manufactured in China: 100 percent on electric vehicles and 25 percent on steel and aluminum products. Beijing promised to react, but at the time expressed his firm opposition to these measures, considering them protectionists.
A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Trade declared on Saturday that an anti-discrimination inquiry launched on September 26 concluded that Canadian taxes “damaged” Chinese companies and “affected the normal order of commerce”, which led China to retaliate.
"Added customs rights of 100 percent to colza oil, oilseeds and peas will be applied," said the Chinese government customs customs agenda in a separate statement. A 25 percent surcharge will also be imposed on water products and pork. These customs rights will come into force on 20 March.

"Canadian measures constitute a serious violation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, are clearly protectionists and discriminate against China," the commission said.
"China urges Canada to immediately correct its bad practices, raise its restrictive measures and eliminate its negative effects," the Ministry of Commerce stressed in the press release. Canadian surcharges apply to cars produced in China, trucks, buses, electric distribution vans and certain hybrid models.

Looking at the bank, he noticed in a large tree that rose from a temple and soon wished to use it to replace the broken mast. As he approached, however, the abbot of the monastery advised him that, before he did, he consulted the spirit of the temple by removing a tray of guessing. As he removed it, he read: "Everything under heaven has a master,/ an honorable man takes nothing to himself. Soon gave up on the intention.
The story illustrates the character of the future monarch that, being an orphan still very young, was welcomed in a Buddhist monastery as a novice monk, realizing the value of chance that since then has worked to peer. In the choice of his counselors, obeying this concern, themselves were committed to planning the following steps.
Among them was Liu Ji (1311-1375) also known as Liu Bowen, the 'Sincere Old' Military Stratega, statesman and poet, to whom works that responded to this desire to predict the succession of the days, such as the book of prophecy Shaobing Gene Quan Wen, 'The Full Song of the Shabing Ball, or the' Master's Philosophical Treaty ' From the brilliant trigram Li, the Fire », to clarify the world and the decision makers.
Among its short chapters is the edifying account of a Qin builder, the musical instrument of the literati, which was presented at the court was refused because it did not have the prestige of being ancient. Then he added some risks, buried him for a while and again introduced him, being very well received. In contrast, the imperial counselor sought to clarify in the truth. As on a trip he made, in the fall of 1343, with a companion for the Huangshan mountain range, the yellow mountain.
Leng Qian (c.1310-c.1371), this friend who was also scholarly in the arts and musical instruments, accompanied him in a way to an elevation, which from the time of Emperor Jiajing (r.1521-67) was designated Qiyun, 'tall as the clouds', being part of the way by sea, packed in the rhythm of the waves. This rhythm that Leng Qian, versed in the secrets of alchemy, sought to convey in the Painting Monte Baiyue (vertical roll, ink on paper, 84.4 x 41.4 cm, at the National Palace Museum in Taipei) who made Liu Ji's request to memorize the journey.
From the bank of the Hengjiang River, he made a painting free of options for styles or schools, taking advantage of chance, as Emperor Hongwu wanted.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves - Coordinator of the CCCM Educational Service
Zhuangzi, the Taoist philosopher, who will have lived between the fourth and 3rd century BC, possibly between 369 and 268 BC, left us in the homonymous work 《莊 (庄) 子》, as was customary at the time, the possibly transmitted teachings in the first person in the interior chapters (1-7), in the second person in the external chapters (8-21) and in the third person of other intellectuals in the chapters of miscellany (22-33).
It is an extremely motivating philosophy that rests, from my point of view, in three fundamental principles: the acceptance of spontaneous nature (道 giving); The Principle of Transformation (物化 Wùhuà), which leads to the postulate of an essential uniformity; and the non-acting (無為/无为 wuwéi), which presupposes the acceptance of a pre-established harmony and destination. We are facing the best order possible, so it is not right to interfere with what is given to us, letting us lead by a necessarily tension rhythm of life, but whose challenges should be viewed without negative reactions, following the existential bamboo model, when confronted with gigantic winds, such as those of tuffons in China.
Chapters 17 and 18, which now bring themselves allegedly belong to their closest disciples, who faithfully transmit the philosophy of the great Taoist master, and Taoism is the most devoted philosophy to develop a personal project, which will therefore exemplary from the existential point of view.
Completing Chapter XVII, that of the Full Full (Qiū Shuǐ Dìshiqī), is assisted at a symbolic dialogue between the philosopher Zhuangzi and his great friend Huizi (惠子), known in the synological tradition, of which Father Thomas Merton is a good herald in The Via de Zhuangzi (1999, 126-127) Joy of fish ”, whose guideline principle is that of communicating connectivity among all living beings, the same that guides another episode, reported at the end of Chapter II, that of the philosopher dreams of being a butterfly (Zhuangzi, 1999,38-40).
In Chapter XVII, Zhuangzi affects the unbelieving friend Huizi to realize, or rather perfectly intuit the joy of fish, since when looking at them on the Hao River bridge recognizes the signs that in themselves manifest when they feel happy. Friend Huizi, following a rationalizing and separatist philosophy, opposes that this is impossible, being silenced by the logical assumption of communication between all nature. Zhuangzi appeals to the argument that it is possible to extend the intelligent dialogue of humans to all living beings. The philosopher, winning the debate, widened the mastery of language, which now includes the verbal, but also the visual, much closer to silent and intuitive communication, highly valued by the Taoist school, always suspicious of excessive and discursive profanity. And at the same time, guarantees the primacy of the connection, sometimes visible, sometimes invisible, among all nature, rooted in Tao, after all this viable connection of a flow of feelings among all beings, which leads to true joy, against the sad and solipsist cosmos defended in some rationalist philosophical traditions, whose primacy is based on a reason to establish the connection with the body, whether individual or whether it is individual or Collective, as António Damásio had the opportunity to denounce in the error of Descartes (2011).
In fact, what matters so that joy is guaranteed, including humans, goes through a widening of the sphere of sensitivity, the feeling of oneself, still thinking of Damásio, the feeling of others, the recognition of the satisfaction coming from the profound connection between all nature.
Then move on to the translation of dialogue, the traditional Chinese to the contemporary and the contemporary to Portuguese:
原文 Classic Chinese1
莊子與惠子遊於濠梁之上。莊子曰： “鯈魚 2 出遊從容 ， 是魚之樂也。”
惠子曰： “子非魚 ， 安知魚之樂？”
莊子曰： “子非我 ， 安知我不知魚之樂？”
惠子曰： “我非子 ， 固不知子矣；子固非魚也 ， 子之不知魚之樂 ， 全矣。”
莊子曰： “請循其本。子曰‘ 汝安知魚樂 ’雲者 ， 既已知吾知之而問我 ， 我知之濠上也。”
今译 Contemporary Chinese
庄子和惠子在濠水桥上游玩。庄子说： “白鲦鱼从容不迫地游来游去 ， 这是鱼的快乐啊！”
惠子说： “您不是鱼 ， 怎么知道鱼是快乐的？”
庄子说： “您不是我 ， 怎么知道我不晓得鱼的快乐？”
惠子说： “我不是您 ， 固然不知道您；您本来也不知道鱼 ， 那么您不知道鱼的快乐 ， 是完全可以肯定的了。“
庄子说： “请回到原来的话题吧。您说‘ 您怎么知道鱼的快乐 ’这句话 ， 就是您已知道我晓得鱼的快乐而来问我的 ， —— 我是在濠水桥上知道的啊！”
(ZHUANGZI, 1999, 282-3)
Note that the translation I propose to Portuguese has some adaptation to our language, for example, I use conjunctions and conjunctive phrases to join prayers and avoid the repetition of certain verbs, with non-philosophical sense, to make reading more fluid:
Zhuangzi and Huizi were strolling on the Hao River bridge, when Zhuangzi said, "The fish swim calmly and carelessly from side to side, this is your joy!"
Huizi replied, "If it's not fish, how can you know the joy of fish?"
Zhuangzi replied, "You're not me, how can you know that I don't know about the joy of fish?"
Huizi continued: “I am not my friend, which is why I do not know him, and the Lord does not know the fish either, so it is more than certain that they do not know their joy.”
Zhuangzi concluded: “Let's go back to the root of the question. He said the following prayer: 'How can you know the joy of the fish', so you already realized that I knew their joy, so I asked me about me, I met her on the Hao River bridge! ”
This spontaneous and natural connection to all that exists is a source of great joy and happiness, as explained to us in chapter XVIII, entitled “Perfect Happiness”. Here the principle of non-acting (無為/无为 wúwéi) is defended, rather, of agreement with nature, inner and exterior, without seeking to interfere with the world around us, because if the goal is to achieve happiness, it is not acquired by any of our actions that have in view of material or social values, as well as wealth, honors, abundance or even health; We arrived at this world without being consulted and will leave when it is our time, as well illustrated the episode of the death of Zhuangzi's wife, reported in this same chapter. When Huizi visits his friend to introduce him to his condolences, he finds him crouching to drum into a basin and singing, in a clear acceptance of fate: yes, the woman had made her very good company over decades, she had to accept the law of nature and not revolt against the pre-established order, which tells us there is health and illness, wealth and poverty, life and death in an eternal transformation cycle.  "Genuine happiness is derived from the absence of happiness, just as perfect fame derives from the absence of fame." (至樂無樂 ， 至譽無譽, in the contemporary version of simplified Chinese, 最大的快乐在于 ‘无乐 '最高的荣誉在于‘ 无誉 ’(Zhuangzi, 1999, 286).
By non-acting, or rather, as we do not follow the existential models of the light/clairvoyant sky and the quiet earth, thus achieving perfect happiness and immense joy in living:
原文 Classic Chinese
天下是非果未可定也。雖然 ， 無為可以定是非。至樂活身 ， 惟無為幾存。請嘗試言之。天無為以之清 ， 地無為以之寧 ， 故兩無為相合 故兩無為相合 萬物皆化生。芒乎芴乎 無從出乎？芴乎芒乎 ， 而無有象乎！萬物職職 ， 皆從無為殖。故曰天地無為也而無不為也
今译 Contemporary Chinese
天下的是非确实还难以下定论。尽管如此 ， “无为” 可以定是非。最大的快乐能存活身心 ， 而只有清静无为才几乎可以存活身心。请让我说说试试看：天 “无为” ， 因而清虚; 地 “无为” ， 因而宁静 ， 天与地这两个无为的合一 ， 才孕育出万物的存在。恍恍惚惚 才孕育出万物的存在。恍恍惚惚 ， 不知道它们从哪里生出来！恍恍惚惚找不出一点迹象来！万物繁多 “天地无心作为 ， 却没有一样东西不是从它们之中产生出来的。”
(ZHUANGZI, 1999, 286)
Translation proposal for Portuguese
It is very difficult to distinguish right from wrong in our world, even though it “not acting” can do so, which is the greatest happiness. Allow me to say it, the sky is clairvoyant because of its "not acting"; The earth is quiet because of its "not acting." Not acting conjugates from heaven and earth leads to pregnancy and existence of all that lives indistinctly, without realizing where they came from! Indistinctly, without traces, the myriads of beings arise, all created from a vital non-report. That is why it is said that, "Heaven and Earth create unintentionally, but nothing is generated."
And it is added in conclusion that it does not interfere with the heaven of the earth with the natural order of the "ten thousand beings" brings great joy and even supreme happiness following what is defended by the founder of Taoism, in chapter VII of the book of the road and virtue 《道德经 • 七》 3, in the translation of António Graça de Abreu (2013):
天長地久
天地所以能長且久者
以其不自生
故能長生
(……)
Eternal, heaven and earth.
Why eternal?
Do not exist for themselves,
So they remain forever.

At meetings will be discussed goals and political and economic plans for this year, without forgetting the evolution of the International Panorama
 
Today begins another session of the Chinese Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC), in Beijing, while for tomorrow is scheduled the start of the National Assembly (APN). The two events are the most important of the Chinese political system, materializing the country's political representativeness system, with the participation of delegations all provinces and regions of China, including the special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong. CCPPC has, as the name implies, an advisory character, while APN is the most important legislative body in the country.
The so -called “two sessions”, with annual periodicity, draw the attention from around the world because it is at this time that the Chinese government presents its economic goals and main political measures for the rest of the year.
According to the Xinhua state agency, data related to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the most attention points attracts, but the "two sessions" will also serve to shed some lights on China's foreign policy, something particularly remarkable in a turbulent global scenario.
Until March 11, the expected date for the closure of the work, there are objectives, calendars and essential policies, shaping “the political direction of the country” in a “complex and challenging global environment”, reads in Xinhua.
Let us look, then, to what we can expect in matters of GDP values. “As the Chinese economy is oriented for high quality development, GDP is not the only measure of the economy, but it remains an important indicator. In 2024, China reached its objective of economic growth of about five percent, thanks largely to a number of significant macroeconomic measures, introduced to compensate for the pressure of economic recession, ”he reads.
Thus, "more concrete policies to stimulate economic activity are expected." According to Xinhua, "China has already given signs of change in its macroeconomic orientation." "At the last central conference of economic labor in December, political officials committed to apply more proactive macroeconomic policies in 2025."
Thus, the adoption of a “monetary policy‘ moderately flexible ’was decided, which represents a significant removal from the 'prudent' approach adopted in the last 14 years,” the agency describes. In this meeting were also defined “nine fundamental priorities”, the first “the increase of consumption”.
Thus, it is expected that in the “two sessions”, “China emphasizes internal demand as the main economic priority”, and this year it is expected “that large-scale equipment updates and consumer exchange programs will be promoted with greater intensity and more extended”.
It is indicated that "China will actively use the maneuver margin for a higher deficit and increase the issuance of special obligations of local administrations", as well as "continuing to issue Special Treasury obligations with a longer term and increase central government transfer payments to local administrations." The "two sessions" will reveal more details in this regard.
Featured
Still on the economic level, Xinhua describes how President XI Jinping underlines on other occasions “the main priorities, such as support for the growth of the private sector”, “the acceleration of the development of the digital economy” and the deepening of the country's opening.
APN members “will analyze the annual budget and government development plan”, and proposals and suggestions related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) ”are also expected to be expected. In fact, this is “one of the main points of interest to China observers”, along with GDP values. It should be noted that, in this field, the country has sought to score points and gain a growing positioning in the market with the creation of the Deepseek platform.
According to the Global Times newspaper, Chinese companies such as Tencent, Baidu and Byd are part of DeepSeek in the products and services they make available, and "some local governments have also announced collaborations with Deepseek IA models to improve public services."
“Many AI-related plans mentioned in work reports of provincial governments [from China] focus on building innovation platforms, promoting industry deeper integration and improving political staff. It is important to note that the rise of platforms such as DeepSeek reflects China's commitment to make leadership in technological advances and a greater strategic focus on talent cultivation and the existence of an innovation conducive environment, ”he reads.
The “two sessions” also constitute “a crucial platform for political legislators and counselors to present suggestions and promote ample consensus on national development” in the AI ​​area, and “some of them are executives of renowned companies and researchers”.
GDP: Maintenance
Still with regard to Chinese GDP, an analysis by Neil Thomas and Jing Qiang of the Asia Society Policy Institute argues that the “two sessions” should reveal “an even more agenda for growth than last year, with approximate objectives of five percent for GDP growth, four percent for the GDP tax deficit and two percent inflation in terms of consumption ”. "Measures should also be introduced to increase consumption and encourage the private sector in innovation," the authors write.
The same analysis of the Asia Society Policy Institute also highlights economic measures to prevent and combat unemployment, a problem that has affected the Chinese economy in recent times.
“China will also announce the annual goals for new jobs in urban areas and the urban unemployment rate. Last year, Beijing settled these objectives in 12 million new jobs and 5.5 percent unemployment rate, and this year's numbers will probably be similar, ”is mentioned.
With regard to domestic consumption, China is intended to be more and more “a hub for product launch, winter tourism and has a 'silver savings' focusing on the area of ​​restoration for an elderly population”. Also according to the analysis of the Asia Society Polycy Institute, "other priorities include rebalancing economic platform regulations, stimulating economic activity in small towns, greater integration into the area of ​​the large bay and expanding investment in maritime industries."
Attention to Investment
The "two sessions" take place with Donald Trump to return to the presidency of the United States of America and certainly that this point will mark the external agenda of the meetings in Beijing throughout the week.
But still regarding the economy, the Chinese authorities will seek to present and discuss measures that may maintain foreign investment attraction in the country, after the launch of the “Action Plan to stabilize foreign investment”, on February 19.
Here is a “strategic change in Beijing's approach, moving away from tax benefits and subsidies and addressing the liberalization of specific sectors, rationalizing regulation and incentives for re-inbackets,” the same analysts point out.
Therefore, Beijing intends to “frame foreign companies into China's regulatory framework to turn them into long -term stakeholders, making local expansion more attractive than capital reafect to other markets”. Analysts also expect the "two sessions" to reveal concrete policies in this regard.
Sam Hou Fai in Beijing
The chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, has been in Beijing since yesterday to attend the opening ceremony of the third session of the 14th National Popular Assembly (APN), which takes place tomorrow.
Sam Hou Fai will be in the Chinese capital until Thursday of this week. According to a statement from the Social Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai will be replaced by the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, who acts interimly, the functions of Chief Executive.

Two residents of Macao of Portuguese nationality reveal to HM which leads them to cross the border frequently, especially the weekend. Cultural diversity, low prices and higher quality of service in bars and restaurants make all the difference
 
Macao Small and Medium-sized (SME) have faced, since the reopening of borders in the postpandeia period, huge difficulties to recover the business, especially those that are further away from the tourist areas. At a time when traveling to China has become extremely easy and cheap, two residents explain why they prefer to move often to the neighboring city of Zhuhai, or even Shenzhen, and consume there instead of being in Macao. Options like dinner outside, catching a taxi or drinking a glass are much cheaper, and the possibility of driving outside the territory has made this option more frequent. But electronic trade has also contributed to the fall of local consumption, they ensure.
Nelson Moura, journalist and resident of Portuguese nationality, goes to Zhuhai whenever he has a free weekend or holidays. It even goes between three to four times a month. “Costs are lower inside China, and then there is the novelty factor. It has never been easy for a non -Chinese resident of Macau to go to China. I previously needed to ask for a visa, had a reduced deadline, and this greatly limited my trips, and always chose more distant places in a context of tourist travel. Local residents could go to China before, but the current convenience, with organized and developed borders, especially Hengqin, with the connection to the light meter, allows for easier connections, ”he told HM.
Since China has flexed the policy of visas and increased the offer of border circulation, traveling to the country is no longer seen as a great trip. “As a foreigner residing in Macao, going to China was a bit like going traveling to another Asian country. In the pandemic we did not go practically from Macau, but now since the policy of visas to Portuguese has been flexible, it is possible to go to China whenever we want, ”said Nelson Moura.
“I am as easily as a Chinese resident, and it has become a viable option to go to the weekends and holidays to China, knowing different sites. The food is a third of the price of what is practiced in Macau, has more quality, with fresh products, the reception offers are better. Macao is a great city, but after three years of pandemic knows very well to get out of here whenever we want. It is a more convenient option now than before. ”
Nelson Moura also considers that "for the Chinese community of Macao and Hong Kong there is a greater convenience of travel," as "there are many residents leading all weekends to China just to go to large commercial surfaces, which allows you to buy large amounts of food."
“Traffic near the border of the HKZM siege or bridge is at a level never seen before. There is the option of being able to drive in the large bay zone which is good for small and expensive cities like are Macau and Hong Kong, ”he said.
PME, the eternal problem
On the side of Macau, associations linked to the Chinese community's commercial sector call for help, asking for more measures such as the great consumption award, or even consumer cards, that is, more campaigns and initiatives so that residents can buy more in Macao with discounts or support.
One of the last voices showing concern about this scenario was Stanley Au, president of the Macao SME association. To TDM Canal Macau, the official argued that in the next lines of government action the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, has to show effective measures to avoid closing and, consequently, more unemployment. “The most urgent and current situation is the closure of companies. I believe the population saw many stores closed in different neighborhoods of the territory. Sometimes, on the same street, there are more stores closed than opened. In addition, the biggest problem is that Macau is facing continuous economic slowdown. If we do not solve this problem, society does not improve, ”he added.
However, according to Nelson Moura, it will always be difficult to combat the attraction of the consumption of Greater China. “Macao's local commerce is a complicated issue. There is a major reduction in consumers, especially on weekends and days when people have time to leave the city. ”
Electronic trade also enhances a reduction in local consumption. “Residents know they find more and cheaper out there. There are Chinese electronic trade companies, such as TAOBAO, which allow purchases from all over China to Macao without transportation charges, which has reduced domestic consumption. People go to stores to see what they want to buy and then do it at Taobao. I don't know how this trend can be circumvented. It is capitalism to work, ”explained Nelson Moura.
The resident also draws attention to the fact that it is now easier to use online payment platforms in China with foreign cards or Macao banks, namely through MPay.
Nelson Moura believes that local SMEs have only endured so much time because they were in a kind of closed economic circuit. “Local businesses lived a little in an island economy, and they survived the fact that the Macao market is in the territory, without people could leave so much. Now that there has been competition with what China has to offer, companies suffer because they often don't offer the service so much quality and at such an attractive price. I know the situation in Hong Kong is similar. ”
“Like” in China
Macaense Miguel Rosa Duque has always worked in Macau and spent in the territory most of the days of the week, but since he started teaching in Zhuhai his life has become more across the border. Highlights the much cheaper night exits as well as the restoration offer. “Macao has no variety and people are filled with the fact that the territory is small. We have hotels and restaurants, but they are expensive because the lace are expensive. Faced with China, in terms of price, the difference is like between heaven and earth. I give an example: To take a taxi from the siege gates to the university where I teach it is 40 minutes of travel, 28 kilometers, and paid about 60 to 80 Renminbis. It's very cheap. In Macao, from the doors of the siege to Coloane we pay 150 patacas or more, the price difference is huge. ”
Miguel Rosa Duque says that the trips to China in her circle of friends have become so frequent that they even created a group on the WhatsApp social network to facilitate group walks. “I prefer to go to China a thousand times just for fun. I have a lot of variety of bars and nightclubs and in Macau everything is dead. A two -person massage costs 600 Renminbis in Macao costs twice. I don't talk about hotel massage. Customer service is much better in China, with more attention to customers, more attentive, and it's all cheaper. If we spend 1000 patacas on a night in Macao, China we spend 400 Renminbis and we are treated like kings. The variety is infinite in terms of restaurants. Macau can't compete, ”he said.
Miguel Rosa Duque says he has friends who, even with a car in Macau, eventually acquired another Chinese enrollment car who are parked in the border parking park because it is cheaper to rent a place to park.
Macanese understands that between local SMEs and trade in China “there is no possible competition”, especially with online sales platforms. “People no longer go to stores here, there are a thousand choices and you can buy it from home. My girlfriend rarely goes to the supermarket, does everything online, for example, ”he added.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Teaching | Chinese universities rise in ranking by disciplines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/ensino-universidades-chinesas-sobem-em-ranking-por-disciplinas/</link><description>Chinese universities have risen at the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025” in various areas, although in arts and humanities Asia remains short of other continents. In 11 disciplines analyzed, such as Law, Management and Economics, China and Singapore are in the 50 best, while Hong Kong stands out in Education Studies
 
The latest world ranking of higher education by areas of knowledge of Times Higher Education, the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025”, concludes that universities in the interior of China have climbed to top positions, although Asia continues to position themselves in the areas of arts and humanities.
In total, 11 academic areas were analyzed. “Arts and Humanities”, “Business and Economics”, “Computer Science”, “Education Studies”, “Engineering”, “Law”, “Life Sciences”, “Medicine and Health”, “Physical Sciences”, “Psychology” and “Social Sciences”.
It is concluded, according to an official note from Times Higher Education (The), that “China and Singapore appear among the 50 best in all 11 subjects”, especially the University of Beijing and Tsinghua University, respectively, for fourth and sex places in “business and economy” disciplines. In fact, “Asia's best performance is registered in the areas of management and economics”, with “its main universities to continue to have difficulty competing worldwide in the field of arts and humanities”. "Concerns about the 'crisis' in humanities seem to be designed to continue this year, but the analysis of The reveals the continuous importance to elite institutions."
Given the analysis of 11 academic areas, the neighboring region of Hong Kong stands out in nine, especially in the area of ​​education, where the University of Beijing and Tsinghua also achieved good results. “The National University of Singapore again occupies the ninth position in Engineering, entering the top 10 of the physical sciences-the first institution in Asia to achieve it-in 10th place,” is also read.
Quoted by the same grade, Simon Marginson, professor at Oxford University, an institution that usually leads rankings worldwide, said that Asia's performance in this classification shows “the multipolar world of higher education” existing today, with greater amplification “national academic capacity”.
"In this context, over time, the relative position of Anglosfera countries and Western Europe must decrease, not because its absolute quality is decreasing, but because the field of comparison is more filled with other countries to emerge," he said.
The same responsible also pointed out that "East Asia and Southeast Asian higher education systems have improved over the past two decades due to the growth in the number of students, increased public funding, more performance -oriented organization and management and selective internationalization policies."
One of the areas where there is a better position of Asian universities is in education studies, showing “a remarkable force, with three universities in the top 10, with the University of Hong Kong in sixth place, the University of Tsinghua in seventh place and the university of Beijing in eighth place”. In addition, The Show that the Chinese University of Hong Kong has made “significant progress” from 19th to 11th position. On the other hand, the Taiwan National University of Science and Technology (Taiwan Tech) obtained "the highest score in terms of research quality."
However, global leadership goes to Stanford University, "surpassing the University of California, Berkeley, demonstrating exceptional performance in both teaching and research environment."
China rises in law
Looking at the area of ​​law, there is currently, according to the ranking of The, the best place to study than Stanford University, which has achieved “excellence in teaching and research environment”, followed by Harvard University, with “exceptional performance” and, thirdly, the University of New York, “with the highest score in terms of research environment”.
Highlight, in this area, for the entrance of the University of Beijing in 14th position, in part due to the good classification “in teaching and the research environment”. It should be noted that, as regards the law, 389 institutions from 48 countries and territories were classified, using 18 “strict performance indicators”.
In the area of ​​law, specialties are analyzed such as constitutional and administrative law and examination to structures and frameworks of governance, or international law, which includes global legal systems and treaties.
Capital Knowledge
China also stands out in business and economy, led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The University of Beijing rose to fourth place, accompanied by 20 other Chinese universities that improved their positions in the table. In this area were analyzed 990 institutions from 85 countries and territories, with the attention focusing on the quality of teaching and research in disciplines such as strategic leadership, international business and organizational development, as well as business finances or economic.
No que diz respeito às ciências sociais, a China surge, de facto, mais abaixo, na lista das 20 melhores, novamente com a Universidade de Pequim em 16º e a Universidade de Tsinghua em 20º. Aqui, a liderança cabe ao MIT, passando a Universidade de Stanford para o terceiro ligar e depois a Universidade de Oxford, com “um desempenho excepcional no ensino e ambiente de investigação”. The London School of Economics and Political Science remains an integral institution of the top 10, now occupying ninth place.
1,093 institutions from 100 countries and territories were analyzed in disciplines such as media communication and studies, politics and international studies, including development studies, sociology, geography and anthropology.
China also rose in the discipline of Computer Science with the University of Beijing to move from 16th to 12th place. In this area, leads the University of Oxford, reaching its highest score ever.
MIT Leads in Arts
The MIT has been at the head of Stanford University, assuming “first place in arts and humanities, as well as business, economy and social sciences”, even if it is first recognized “by specialization in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics”. According to the ranking, it is now “the best place to study arts - with high scores in each of the five pillars underlying the methodology, especially the quality of the investigation and the international perspective”.
In the 11 disciplines of the ranking, "Stanford ranked first in education, law and psychology studies, Harvard University ranked first in engineering and life sciences."
The only local institution in the ranking of The Disciplines is the University of Macao (one), but in places far below top 10: in the area of ​​computational sciences, it is in the 126-150 best in the world, a similar position occupied in the area of ​​education and engineering. In the area of ​​law, for example, one is in the best group of 176-200, while in life sciences is among the 151-175 best.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 04:59:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Architecture | Liu Jiakun won Pritzker 2025 prize</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/07/arquitectura-liu-jiakun-venceu-premio-pritzker-2025/</link><description>Liu Jiakun won this year's Pritzker Prize. Chengdu's natural architect was chosen by the work “coherent”, in peace with nature and the surrounding world. The organization of the prize highlights the “path that was neither linear nor expected”, and architectural projects with “convincing answers” ​​in environmental terms
 
In Liu Jiakun's work is the citizen who rules, without fixed lines or barriers, combining the old and the modern. But above all, there is a kind of consistency. The Chinese architect, born in 1956 in Chengdu province, won this year's Pritzker Prize, a distinction often described as the Nobel Prize in Architecture. With this week's announcement, the point that was missing to consecrate the talent of a man who lived and worked in a changing China was added and who narrowly did not give up architecture. By the way, according to the official information of the Pritzker Award on Liu Jiakun, his journey “until architecture was neither linear nor expected”.
The mother was an internal doctor at Chengdu Second People's Hospital and it was there that much of her days spent during her childhood. In the years when China lived intensely Maoism and then during the process of reform and openness, Liu underwent all political and social transformations as it grew. He attended the program for “educated young people” in the area of ​​agriculture, and then the Chongqing Institute of Architecture and Engineering, later called the University of Chongqing University in 1978. “As in a dream, I suddenly realized that my life was important,” he said, according to the official information of the Pritzker award.
The studio in his own name, Jiakun Architects, only emerged in 1999 in his hometown, Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province.
About himself and his work, Liu Jiakun said: "Aspire always being like water-permeating a place without having a fixed shape of his own and infiltrating me in the local environment and in the place itself." “Over time, water is gradually solidified, becoming architecture and perhaps even the highest form of human spiritual creation. However, it maintains all the qualities of this place, both good and bad, ”he added.
Regarding the attribution of Pritzker, the jury considered that the Chinese architect knew how to innovate, keeping the side more traditional than the profession can have. “Identity has as much to do with the individual and the collective meaning of belonging to a place. Liu Jiakun revisits Chinese tradition without nostalgic approach or ambiguity, but as a trampoline for innovation. Create a new architecture that is simultaneously historical record, infrastructure, landscape and a remarkable public space, ”says the organization.
Spatial commitment
Building houses or buildings can be much more than simple building, establishing a commitment to space and the environment. For the Pritzker jury, "in a global context where architecture strives to find adequate answers to rapidly evolving social challenges, Liu Jiakun gave convincing answers that also celebrate people's daily lives as well as their community and spiritual identities."
Also according to the jury, "through a remarkable work of deep consistency and constant quality, Liu Jiakun imagines and builds new worlds, free from any aesthetic or stylistic embarrassment."
“Instead of a style, it has developed a strategy that is never based on a recurring method, but rather the evaluation of the specific characteristics and demands of each project differently. That is, Liu Jiakun takes current realities and manipulates them to the point of offering a totally new scenario of everyday life. In addition to knowledge and technique, it adds common sense and wisdom to the designer toolbox, ”he adds.
The note that presented the award states that the architect can project “a built environment that is often being pulled in opposite directions”, rethinking “the foundations of density through cohabitation, creating an intelligent solution that balances the opposite forces at stake”.
The jury also describes that "through a remarkable work of deep consistency and constant quality, Liu Jiakun imagines and builds new worlds, free from any aesthetic or stylistic embarrassment."
The largest projects
This year's Pritzker statement highlights the “West Village” project in Chengdu, classified as “transformative”, where Liu Jiakun knew “reformulate the paradigm of public spaces and community life”, “inventing new independent and shared forms of living together, where density does not represent the opposite of an open system”. The architect created here a space that allows "adaptation, expansion and replicability."
Also noteworthy are “subtle and memorable museums” created by themselves, such as the Suzhou Museum of Imperial Kiln Brick or the Shuijingfang Museum, also in Chengdu. In turn, at the Huishan Memorial in Chengdu, the architect "understands that identity is a matter of collective and personal memory, brilliantly raising the individual perspective to a fundamental element of place creation in order to revive a community dimension."
Degree in 1982, Liu was part of the first generation of students responsible for the major projects of the so -called “Nova China”, already with Deng Xiaoping to the rudder of the central government. At the beginning of his career, he was linked to Chengdu's Institute for Research and Architectural Design, a state-owned entity, having moved to Nagqu in Tibeta, where he lived two years in the 1980s.
About this time, the architect recalled his “greatest strength at the time seemed to be my fear of nothing, beyond the abilities of painting and writing,” pionering books and writing at night when he did not project.
His career in architecture was almost set aside until Liu Jiakun saw Tang Hua's solo architecture exhibition, a former university colleague at the Shanghai Art Museum in 1993. Such “rekindled his passion for the profession and fueled a new mindset that he could also be diverted from prescribed social aesthetics,” describes the pritzker jury.
For Liu, "architecture must reveal something - abstract, distill and make visible the qualities inherent in local people," "the power to shape human behavior and create atmospheres, offering a sense of serenity and poetry, evoking compassion and mercy, and cultivating a meaning of shared community."</description><pubDate>2025-03-07 02:59:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Study | Digital insomnia treatment can combat depression</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/estudo-tratamento-digital-de-insonia-pode-combater-depressao/</link><description>An unprecedented study developed by several universities, including the Chinese Hong Kong University and the University of Beijing, concluded that cognitive behavioral therapy through mobile phone applications can help combat young people by monitoring insomious. The rate of disease reduction is about 40 percent
 
The study “Effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Based on insomnia for insomnia in the prevention of Major depressive disorder in insomnia and subclinical depression: a random clinical trial” [Effectiveness of App-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia on Preventing Major Depressive Desorder Inorder Whit Insomnia and Subclinical Depression: Randomized clinical trial] promises answers to the treatment of cases of depression in the younger ones.
The work, published by PLOS MEDICINE magazine and developed by academics from various universities in Hong Kong and China, included the University of Hong Kong, Chinese Hong Kong University or the University of Beijing, concludes that it is possible to reduce, by about 40 percent, cases of depression in young people using a mobile phone application that monitors insoponials, a habitual symptoms, a symptom in the one who suffers from the sufferers illness. The data were presented at the end of last week in Hong Kong.
To reach the results, a random sample of more than 700 young Chinese from the interior of China and Hong Kong with insomnia disturbance and depressive symptoms, aged 15 to 25 years, who underwent testing with application for six weeks, was chosen.
Thus, “this controlled and random study evaluated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for application based on application (TCC-I) in preventing the future appearance of Major Depressive Disturbance (MDD) in young people” can be read. This at a time when "more and more evidence suggests that insomnia plays an important role in the development of depression," in this investigation "intervention in insomnia as a promising approach to prevent depression in young people."
Thus, “applications based TCC-I is effective in preventing the future appearance of major depression and improving the results of insomnia among young people with insomnia and subclinical depression”. The study also concludes that "these results underline the importance of aiming at insomnia to prevent the appearance of DMG [a type of depression] and enhance the need for greater dissemination of digital TCC-I to promote sleep and mental health in the young population."
It is also concluded that the TCC-I based on applications "not only improved night insomnia symptoms, but also reduced daytime fatigue and led to greater change to maturity."
More than 700 young people analyzed
After testing the application of TCC-I, base clinical interviews were conducted over a period of six to 12 months to understand the results in participants and monitor symptoms. We spoke, in the period between September 9, 2019 and November 25, 2022, of 708 participants, of which 407 was women (57 percent), with an average ages of 22 years. The study also points out that “37 participants, 10 percent, in the intervention group and 62 participants, 18 percent, in the control group developed new mood disturbances over the 12 months of follow -up”.
In turn, the group that was subject to CBT-I based on mobile phone application, ie cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, presented “rates of remission of insomnia disturbance higher than post-intervention control groups” within one year. In addition, the same group "reported a greater decrease in depressive symptoms than post-intervention controls and over six months of follow-up." The authors of the study understand that "insomnia was a mediator of the effects of intervention on depression", and no adverse events related to interventions were reported. "
The authors left for this study with some proven ideas that insomnia is one of the main causes for depression. "Emerging data on insomnia intervention, especially cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (TCC-I), have shown promising results in insomnia relief and depressive symptoms in patients with insomnia," he reads.
Existing investigations focus on adults and elderly, so it was important to analyze this matter among the younger ones.
"In addition, there are few studies with suitable statistical power to demonstrate the preventive effect of TCC-I on depression, both at the level of symptoms and disturbances," explains the study authors, stressing that "little is known about whether the digital insomnia intervention can potentially prevent youthful depression."
Important meanings
The study also points out that cognitive behavioral therapy for applications based on insomnia is a viable and effective intervention to prevent future depression at both symptoms and disturbances in young people. ” However, further studies are recommended to explore “the integration of application-based TCC-I in clinical practice to improve accessibility and prevent depression among the young population”.
It is also mentioned the need for more clinical trials “to explore the potential benefits of adapting digital interventions on sleep in relief and prevention of depression” in order to “move towards personalized and staggered care approaches to the community”.
Limitations are referred to in this study published in “PLOS Medicine”, namely “the inclusion of a mixture of individuals with and without prior depression, and a limited sample of adolescents, although there was an adequate global sample”.
To the Hong Kong press, the study authors spoke of the importance of these results and how they can constitute new tools in future treatments of the disease. Quoted by The Standard HK, Chen Si-Jing, the first author of the Postdoctoral Research and Psychiatry Department of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the study "shows that Digital TCC-I is effective in preventing the future appearance of severe depression, with satisfactory effectiveness." Wing Yun-Kwok, director of the Li Chiu Kong family sleep evaluation unit, indicated that future studies will focus on digital intervention on insomnia in clinical practice.
The unprecedented character of this study in Asia still gives him greater importance. According to Lu Lin, an academic at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and president of the PKU Sixth Hospital, to date "no investigation in Asia had been carried out on the effectiveness of this therapy."</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:07:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Macao Platform seen in the context of Chinese foreign policy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/19/diplomacia-plataforma-de-macau-vista-no-contexto-da-politica-externa-chinesa/</link><description>In "Paradiplomacy in China: Macao's role in relations between sino-Portuguese countries," Xu Heng Wang concludes that the role of platform with Lusophony "can be seen with extension of China's foreign policy." However, the MSar presents its own ideas, without “complete obedience to the central government”, indicates the academic
 
Macao's diplomatic role in the relationship with China and Portuguese -speaking countries was the focus of Xu Heng Wang's doctoral thesis defended in January at the University of Coimbra (UC) Faculty of Economics. In “Paradiplomacy in China: Macao's role in relations between sino-Portuguese countries”, the author argues that, regarding the role of Economic and Commercial Platform of MSA in the connection of Beijing and Portuguese-speaking countries, there is a certain extent of Chinese foreign policy, but at the same time, ideas proper to local authorities.
"Although the role of Macao as an economic and commercial platform can be seen as an extension of China's foreign policy, this does not mean that Macau is in a state of complete obedience to the central government," is referred to in research work.
Although it is stressed that “it is difficult to discern Macao's desire to develop, it must be mentioned that Macau has his own ideas about the course of his development”, namely in relation to the game and the entire economic structure.
“Macao has long foresaw that the structure of his economy would be unbalanced and that the game would be dominant. Authorities and academics have also made many debates on the issue of unsustainable development based on the game industry. At the same time, Macau is also very aware of its advantages in terms of cultural integration, having carried out the construction of a historic and cultural city, becoming a tourist attraction. ”
Between the own ideas and what is defined in the field of foreign policy by Beijing, there is "a direction of the development of Macao which, basically, is consistent with the role that the central government has conceived to Macao."
In this context, the author concludes that “the interests of Macao and the Central Government are basically the same”, being “a special case of paradiplomacy in China”, due to the implementation of politics “a country, two systems” in the territory and the high degree of autonomy it provides in various areas.
THE ROLE OF THE MACAU FORUM
Xu Heng Wang took a different approach on this issue, not resorting to traditional international relations theories, because “Macao interactions involve both state and non-state actors,” so these theories “do not provide an accurate explanation of Macao's role”. Thus, and to understand the role of Macau in the relations between China and the Portuguese -speaking countries, the idea of ​​paradiplomacy with Guanxi theory, a term used to describe social, economic or political relationships that can enhance business or other benefits, was combined.
Thus, it is noted that "the creation of the Macau Forum can be considered one of the prominent paradiplomatic activities," with "Macao playing a role that mixes its development with the strategic objectives of the Chinese central government, especially with regard to Portuguese -speaking countries."
Macao has performed some relevant activities in the relations between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, ”although it is assumed that“ the results have been limited so far ”.
The academic states that these activities are "mainly concentrated in the fields of economics, education, tourism, culture and technology, with political effects that are not yet so evident." In addition, it is pointed out that "the influence of Macau on the relations between China and the different Portuguese -speaking countries has varied in intensity." Still, "much of the interaction and cooperation between Macao, China and the Portuguese -speaking countries occurred through the Macao Forum."
Help with objectives
In general terms, the “paradiplomacy of Macao is a complex and fluid process”, and the territory “shows its identity as a world tourism and leisure center and a characteristic financial center with international activities”, with the aim of “improving economic structure” and making diversification beyond game.
The author highlights fundamental areas such as services for small and medium enterprises, exchange-cultural and formation of bilingual talents. In addition, it is explained that “the central government provides political support to Macau based on its foreign policy needs, with the reinforcement of cooperation” with Portuguese -speaking countries. In these actions, include the Great Bay project, as well as the idea of ​​Macao's establishment as the Renminbi Compensation Center (RMB).
“On the one hand, the central government provides conveniences to Macau and helps [the territory] to establish its identity, 'supported by the mainland China market'. On the other hand, it helps Macau to develop the activity of RMB compensation center for transactions that occur on the Macao negotiation platform. ”
Thus, it denotes the author, "the role of Macao in paradiplomacy, but as an assistant to the implementation of central foreign policy, is also evident." However, "the paradiplomacy of Macao does not only reflect the diplomatic objective of helping the Chinese government to establish relations with Portuguese -speaking countries, but also the improvement of Macau's own international influence."
The doctoral thesis also presents a practical case analysis of Macau's relationship with the most striking Portuguese -speaking countries in the economic relationship with China, namely Angola and Brazil. "For Angola, Macao has played an approach role to China," as the African country needs "foreign investment for the hydroelectric power, infrastructure and agriculture sector." Thus, the binding axis is made at the Macao Forum, where "Angola can establish relations with the Chinese central government and cooperate on investment, in addition to the oil sector."
In addition, "most of China's investment in Angola comes from large companies, while small and medium -sized companies still depend mainly on Macau for commercial cooperation."
In the case of Brazil the situation is slightly different, because “in sino-Brazilian relations, the role of Macao is not obvious”, more “centered around the BRICS”, a group of emerging economies initially founded by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which today has ten member countries.
“Although the first ministerial meeting of the Macao Forum (2003) preceded the first meeting of the BRICS (2009) leaders, the impact of the Macao Forum on Sino-Brazilian Relations is not obviously as good as the influence established through direct meetings. Therefore, in the early days of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, relations between the two countries developed more at national level. ”
It is also highlighted that "although the role that Macao has in the opening of a door to the mainland China market has been established in Brazil's eyes, the impact of Macao on sino-Brazilian relations has not yet become obvious."
It is certain, however, that in recent years "the continuous development of the Macao Forum and the continuous improvement of organizational activities, its attraction to Brazil has become increasingly evident." “As Brazil tries to expand trade, commercial cooperation and investment with China will no longer be concentrated only in national business giants and will be increasingly targeted at private companies,” is still completed.
Regarding Portugal, the “attitude is very positive”, to the existing historical connection. “In many memos and statements signed with China, Macau has been stated to play an increasingly important role as a link between China and Portugal. Portugal and China have great technical cooperation in the domains of new energies, aerospace industry and other technological innovations. There is also a profound relationship of cooperation in the field of education. ”
It is also noteworthy that Portugal “not only signed cooperation agreements in the field of teaching with universities in the interior of China, but also signed several cooperation and exchange agreements with the main universities of Macao”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-19 00:24:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Vocational Education | Alert Study for Human Resources Failures in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/ensino-profissional-estudo-alerta-para-falhas-em-recursos-humanos-na-china/</link><description>A study published in The China Quarterly concludes that there are still many questions to resolve so that technical-professional education in China can respond to human resources needs.

Technical-professional education in China has been popularized, but a recently published study in Cambridge University Press's “The China Quarterly” magazine, concludes that there are still gaps to find that courses can actually respond to the country's needs in the industrial sector.
“More Graduates, Fewer Skills? Vocational Education Expansion and Skilled Labar Shortages in China ”[More graduates, less skills? The expansion of vocational education and qualified labor absences in China] is the name of the study developed by Xinmiao Song of the University of Lingnan, and Duudo XU of the Department of Sociology at the University of Hong Kong.
Academic work draws attention to the “disturbing tendency” of “rapid massification of vocational education, which gives priority to the number of enrollments over the quality of education” and “does not respond to the search for skills and qualified labor”.
In addition, the authors add to the “adverse consequences for both administrative management and teaching, caused by this scenario. “The development of competences often is up to post-school professional associations and an exclusive group of elite students. However, reform initiatives, such as the Manual Arts Campaign and competency contests, benefit only a few, without improving the prospects of employment of the student population in general. ”
Thus, the two academics argue that “more attention to the tensions inherent to China's teaching and vocational training system”, because “only when there is a deeper understanding of the underlying causes to the ineffective training of competences in professional schools can China achieve its national objective of industrial modernization”.
The study was developed in two vocational schools, and interviews were conducted to 104 students. In addition, ethnographic data of four doctoral projects were used in the area of ​​vocational education, developed between October 2017 and December 2020.
It is also noted that the country needs “increasingly urgent” of qualified workers “due to world economic competition”. However, "despite the massive expansion of the teaching and vocational training system in the last two decades, there is still a significant deficit of qualified labor," there is "debates about the ineffectiveness of vocational education." These focus above all on, “in the absence of institutional synergies between teaching and industry, but they often ignore the conflicts inherent to the vocational education system and the processes of competency training at the micro level”.
Practical difficulties
To the “micro level”, that is, in schools, the authors denoted the existence of several difficulties in the effective functioning of these courses in line with the intended results.
In secondary education there is “a delicate balance between the promotion of social equality and the development of skills”. However, "analysis indicates that, in the context of the rapid expansion of secondary education, schools have difficulty effectively harmonizing these objectives."
“In order to maintain a proper student body, schools and teachers are often obliged to compromise the quality of candidates and teaching standards in the classroom. This situation generates a change in daily pedagogy and school administration to preserve discipline and stability, thus attributing the development of competences and the selection of talents-ideally a mission from the whole school-to extra-curricular professional associations, pursued by a few, ”he is added.
It is also concluded that “the acquisition of competences is a multifaceted process, shaped by the dynamic interaction between educators and students”, because “the academic preparation of students and their motivations to learn are equally pertinent for the formation of microcompetence, as are the resources of schools and the capabilities of teachers”.
Thus, “the resolution of the ineffective formation of competencies requires more than top initiatives to the base”, “a approach that recognizes the obstacles that students face in the acquisition of skills, as well as their seizures and uncertainties in the search for employment, is necessary.
The authors also talk about “elitism” in some formations related to handicraft courses and “competency contests”. "These initiatives may inadvertently suggest that handicrafts are reserved for a restricted number of people, as competencies contests often remain inaccessible to most vocational education students, both objective and psychologically."
Thus, the authors emphasize that "there is a significant undoing between this elitist approach to the acquisition of competences and the real conditions faced by vocational education students."
“The superficial promotion of manual labor spirit and the exclusivity of skills failed to truly resolve the challenges associated with the acquisition of skills, the search for employment and the commitment to follow technical professions among vocational education students,” is also mentioned.
Still, limitations in the study are referred to, namely the fact that it focuses only on public schools in higher secondary education, and the results may not completely represent other levels of vocational education, such as the higher institutes of vocational training ”.

Numbers from the “Factory of the World”
In the study is the intense industrial development that China has achieved in the last 40 years, emerging as the "factory of the world," as the authors describe, "taking advantage of their demographic dividends."
“However, the intensive model of labor growth has proved unsustainable due to population aging and intense global competition. To escape the 'medium income trap', the Chinese government has launched a series of industrial modernization actions in the transforming industry and services sectors, ”but“ despite the ambitious agendas for the next decade, the persistent scarcity of qualified workers continues to make these efforts difficult, ”he is mentioned.
In 2020, there were more than 23 million vocational students, so "this scarcity of qualified labor is a surprise," is referred to in the study, which highlights "the substantial efforts and resources that the Chinese government has dedicated to improving vocational education in recent years."
For example, “Free Secondary Professional Education, the expansion of higher vocational facilities in one million students from 2019 to 2021 and the creation of universities of applied technology” emerged. In addition, the vocational education system watched an unprecedented trajectory, with enrollment in secondary professional schools higher than increasing from 4.56 million in 2004 to 7.11 million in 2009 ″.
In terms of the need for human resources, the study cites data from China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security for 80 cities in the country. "The ministry's quarterly reports have revealed that the work between work/person looking for qualified labor reached a historical peak of 2.0 in early 2020", and "higher level qualified workers, technicians and higher technicians had a particularly high demand."
It is also noted that the Ministry of Education predicts that the country continues to confront this year “with a deficit of 30 million qualified workers, which represents a 48 percent break in domains such as materials, energy savings and vehicles powered by new energies”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:25:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Health | Song Pek Kei asks for more formations for nurses</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/saude-song-pek-kei-pede-mais-formacoes-para-enfermeiros/</link><description>To face the search for more and better health care, Mrs Song Pek Kei requested additional incentives for the formation of new nurses. In a written interpellation, the deputy linked to the Fujian community indicated that between 2013 and 2023, the number of nurses increased by 1,126 professionals, which considered insufficient to respond to demand in the territory.
In addition, Song indicates that in previous estimates, the government predicted the need for the number of nurses to grow annually between 10 and 15 percent. However, the latest data show that growth was less than 10 percent, which considered insufficient and worrying. Therefore, given that the government has pondered the authorization to hire non-residents for the profession, Song Pek Kei intends to know how much the planned studies are.
The deputy also pointed out that the government has not yet updated data on the search for qualified staff for the nurse's career and defends the regular dissemination of employees' data in this profession, in order to make policy adjustment.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:05:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Work Accidents | Compensation limits kept</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/acidentes-de-trabalho-mantidos-limites-de-indemnizacoes/</link><description>The SAM Hou Fai government has chosen to maintain unchanged compensation for damages resulting from occupational accidents and occupational diseases. The decision was communicated by the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL), through a statement issued on Friday.
"After analyzing data on the economic situation, the labor market and the indemnities for occupational accidents for the year 2023 in Macao, […] the Government of MSAR has decided, in the assumption of the balance of the rights and interests of workers and employers, to maintain the boundaries of damages resulting from occupational accidents and occupational disease," he was reported.
According to the executive, the decision was made after being heard "representatives" of insurers, workers and bosses.
Currently, compensation for each worker victim of an accident at work or occupational illness have as a limit 3.15 million patacas. In addition, compensation can predict up to 300 daily patacas, by consultation outside health facilities.
In case of maximum disability by work accident, the minimum compensation limits are 425 thousand patacas and 1.42 million patacas. If the worker dies, family members can receive a minimum compensation of 340,000 patacas and a maximum of 1.13 million patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:04:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Maternity License | Associations ask for extension to 90 days</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/licenca-de-maternidade-associacoes-pedem-extensao-para-90-dias/</link><description>Faced with the reduction of birth, workers and residents asked the chief executive better conditions for mothers and fathers, as well as increased flexibility in housing policies
 
The General Federation of Macao Workers has asked the government to enlarge the maternity leave in the private sector of current 70 days to 90 days.
According to TDM Macau, the association's vice president also defended an extension of the paternity license, currently fixed in five days. Leong Men Ian also appealed to reinforce the financial support given to his parents. Currently, the government assigns 5,418 patacas to the parents of each newborn. On the other hand, Leong said authorities should allow couples to live in public housing to move to a larger apartment after they have children.
The leader was speaking in the presentation of an inquiry into the living conditions of women in Macau, whose results show that 73 percent are concerned about employment prospects and 48 percent with care for children and the elderly.
Also Deputy Ho Ion Sang, vice president of the General Union of Macao Residents Associations, questioned the government about plans to increase maternity and paternity licenses.
On February 20, Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam Vai Man, promised to allow residents in public housing to move to a larger apartment to encourage birth.
The new chief executive of Macao, who took office in late December, admitted during the election campaign that one of the biggest long -term challenges is low birth.
Low of birth
Sam Hou Fai said it is necessary to “create conditions in terms of education and employment” to rise birth and promised to study the extension of maternity leave and the creation of a compulsory central action fund.
Macau registered in 2024 only 0.58 births per woman, the lowest fertility rate provided that the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services began to compile this data in 2000, and far from the value needed to replace generations (2,1).
The fertility rate is even lower than the estimate made in a report released in July by the United Nations Economic and Social Affairs Department (UNDESA): 0.68 births per woman.
Although more optimistic, the Undesa estimate already indicated that Macau would have had the lowest fertility in the world, at a great distance from the second jurisdiction in the list, Singapore, with 0.95 births per woman. Official data show that there were 3,607 births in Macau last year, the lowest number for almost two decades.
In late January, the Deputy Director of Health Services, Kuok Cheong U, predicted that there should be less than 3,500 births in the region in 2025, a number that would be the lowest since 2004.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:03:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Most women with cut or frozen salary</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/maioria-das-mulheres-com-salario-cortado-ou-congelado/</link><description>After the pandemic more than 80 percent of women saw the frozen salary or suffered cuts. The conclusion is part of an inquiry prepared by the Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom).
On Friday, the Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom) presented an inquiry into the work and life situation of women, based on 970 inquiries, and 86 percent of the interviewees confessed to having frozen or reduced salary. At the same time, 14 percent of the interviewees admitted that the salary had been increased after the pandemic.
When asked about the main reasons for concern in everyday life, 77 percent of respondents indicated the economic situation, 73 percent the future prospects for professional career development, and 67 percent the need to take care of children, elderly or other family members. Most people who complain about the impact of taking care of family members indicated that they have their responsibility at least two people.
More support
Given the results, the study authors indicated that many women suggested a greater protection of rest at work, better employment and professional development opportunities.
"It is necessary for the government to focus on the primacy of local employment, not only for women, but also for all local residents by defining a long -term policy, and launching more training and promotion measures for qualified staff," said Faom Ella Law.
In the findings of the inquiry, it is also advocated that government should alleviate the economic pressure of the population by improving the measure of social welfare, such as the pecuniary check, consumer card, water and light or health valleys.
To encourage birth, respondents also advocated the increase in maternity leave and improve the conditions of public housing.
Given the conclusions, the investigators team called on the government to improve current policies, increase the number of days for paternity leave and elaborate legislation to ensure women's breastfeeding time.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 03:59:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Women's Day | Government praises progress towards equality</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/dia-da-mulher-governo-enaltece-progresso-rumo-a-igualdade/</link><description>On International Women's Day, the Government praised advances in access to work, education, health and participation in the public sphere. The difference in wages between men and women in 2023 was 2 percent, below the OECD average. In the highest positions of administration, Macau is moving towards equality, and in the judiciary women are the majority
 
On Saturday, the International Women's Day was celebrated, with the Government of Manda to mark the advances of the female condition in the territory since the transfer of Portuguese administration.
The Institute of Social Action (IAS) has summarized the policies and social progress of Macau women in access to medical care, education, employment, safety and social perks in more than two decades.
"With regard to employment, with a high level of education of women from Macao and the friendly policy of child care mechanism, the rate of women's workforce participation increased from 56.1 (in 1999) to 65.2 percent (in 2023)," the body led by Hon Wai. IAS states that in addition to the 9.1 percent increase in women's labor participation rate between 1999 and 2023, the difference for men reduced 20.3 percentage points to 6 percentage points in the period under analysis.
In addition to the biggest presence in the labor market, in 2023 the difference in salaries in Macau was 2 percent, still with men earning more. However, the government emphasizes that the salary difference in the territory is lower than the average value compared to the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
In the chapter of participation in public affairs, still in 2023, the proportion of women in the civil service in Macao was 44.9 percent, while the proportion of women in positions of direction and leadership stood at 40.7 percent. In the local judiciary, 51.3 of the territory judges are women, while in the government led by Sam Hou Fai there are three women among the nine holders of the main positions, or 33.3 percent. An organ where a lack of female representation is denoted, and the government has not mentioned, is in the Legislative Assembly where only five women count on a cast of 33 deputies, that is, men form almost 85 percent of the hemicicle.
Other spheres
Prior to entering the labor market and the demand for professional achievement, IAS highlights female evolution in access to education, starting by mentioning that implementation for 15 years of free education policy is an opportunity for both genres. But analyzing the situation more deepened, IAS indicates that in the school year 2023/2024, the university's access rate was 97.5 percent, more than 0.5 percentage points higher than men. “The proportion of the retention of academic qualification of women's higher education courses increased from 6.1 (in 2001) to 30.6 percent (in 2021)”, an increase of 24.5 percentage points in 20 years, adds IAS.
Another high asset, it is concerned with day care centers for children under 3 years old, which is over 60 percent, "much higher than the average value of the care rate access rate of the OECD countries."
In the health level, IAS states that “the maternal mortality rate has been at a low level for over 10 years. Women's life expectancy went from 80.5 years of age (in 1999) to 86.1 (in 2024) ”, superior to that of men.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 03:58:35</pubDate></item><item><title>CCPPC | Macau proposes Sino-Liropono Logistics Center</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/07/ccppc-macau-propoe-centro-logistico-sino-lusofono/</link><description>The proposals submitted by MSAR representatives at the Chinese Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC) included the creation of a Sino-Lusophone Logistics Center in Hengqin, as well as a university park with campus for all Macao higher education institutions.

It all started when Montenegro wanted to be a high -level politician and soon suspected of crumbling in the transformation of his house in ruins, Espinho, transformed into a luxury property. Montenegro went to president of the PSD and had, and has, a family business that is dedicated to consulting and real estate.
Okay, the creed has never stopped and the list of accusations has given water in recent weeks. Montenegro never wanted to publicize the entire customers of his family business, knowing that some are customers of great financial power and have had business with the state.
Montenegro gave a “press conference” -where journalists had to have a stupid tape in their mouth… because they were not allowed to ask questions -and where the Prime Minister, surrounded by all ministers to compose the power branch that has only been in the election campaign for a year, has announced to the Portuguese that he had no more clarification and that if the opposition wanted to advance with a motion of the government. And if it did not happen, the government could advance with a motion of trust. The Communist Party soon advanced with a motion of censorship, which was spoiled in Parliament. In this session, the socialist party may have made a serious mistake in its political strategy. Why? Because if the result of early legislative elections, they give the socialists scarcely, then they cannot expect communists support to govern.
But, continuing inside the spider web, Montenegro was news because he bought two houses the ready payment of about 700 thousand euros, with money resulting from the income of the family business that has three workers: his wife and two children. Worse still, Montenegro spent a huge shame when last week came to public who was spending daily 400 euros in a luxury hotel. Apparently, the Chief Executive finds it reasonable to pay half a national minimum wage per day, instead of living in the prime minister's official residence, for this reason the São Bento Palace is called “residence”.
It was no longer enough to affront all workers who have children aged 20, 30 and 40 who do not even have decent wages, having the distinct can to be outraged by their children, 19 and 23, can not fail to make 900,000 euros in four years, to the account of their parents' contact list. So that there is no doubt, 400 euros per night equals 12 thousand euros per month. Now the Prime Minister wins 4,500 net euros per month. As for us, it is infamous that Luís Montenegro does not understand the lack of decorum and respect for those who work, it gives difficulties and who is removed from the income subsidy and the pension decreased by more than 100 euros, that, from one month to another without notice.
However, the prime minister announced a motion of trust that will be debated and voted in the Assembly of the Republic already tomorrow, in yesterday there was no negotiations between Montenegro and the leader of the socialists Pedro Nuno Santos, in the sense that the PS remove the proposal of a parliamentary committee of inquiry and Montenegro to remove the motion of confidence. It was still possible to prevent a political crisis that can seriously harm the country in financial terms.
We think it will happen precisely what Montenegro wants. That it arrives, Socialist Party, Pan and Left Bloc vote against the motion of trust, possibly with the abstention of the PCP, and in the end, with the motion of confidence spoiled the government falls and the President of the Republic will have to mark early elections. The same Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa who was all silent about the Montenegro Spider Web-and now he has come to talk, and even more, because he gave the motion of confidence as a splash before being voted-and has announced that by his accounts the elections will take place there for the end of May.
We are really seeing a dirty laundry election campaign every day on the road. Surprising is the political tactic of the men of Montenegro. Possibly as they are almost all advised by Cavaco Silva, they are thinking, and a minister has already said it publicly, that AD could have the absolute majority… well, no more. A government that has left the poor people in a number of 4 million increasingly in misery, I am not seeing that AD gets an absolute majority. Sincere times are difficult to understand these politicians. We had legislative elections just a year ago, there are municipal elections in September and shortly afterwards presidential elections in January 2026.
For a country in the tail of Europe, don't you think it's the extra electoral luxury? Povinho is fed up with this balofa politiquice that in no way improves the quality of life of the Portuguese. Perhaps for this reason is that all polls indicate that the Portuguese do not want a president of the professional political republic but a military man…
Portugal has no medicine. Overcome AD or PS the next elections, we will continue to observe the gladiators with all kinds of dirty clothes to wash. There is no remedy, because no one gets an absolute majority that could give green light to deep and structural decisions for the sake of people, such as giving up that superfluous Alcochete airport and selling all TAP. There is no remedy because rulers and deputies will continue to be owners of real estate and alter the law of soils so that their real estate agents are a gold mine in rare lands…</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:25:15</pubDate></item><item><title>With fate in the hands</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/07/com-o-destino-nas-maos/</link><description>“My destiny is in my hands,” is a speech by Ne Zha, the protagonist of the Chinese animation series “Ne Zha 2”, which represents the way of thinking of a bolder younger generation that boldly challenges those in power.  To some extent, whether the romance and the film, they criticize the current state of society. The protagonist wins the audience and the film naturally became a tremendous success. The inhabitants of Macao, who face the current economic situation, should also say "our destiny is in our hands"?
The Government of MSAR has finally announced that it will relaunch the “big prize for consumption”, which this year will take place of March 24 June 1, to help small and medium -sized SMEs and stimulate local consumption. Its promotional initiative also provides “immediate discount for elderly consumption”. The elderly can get immediate discounts on consumption of 300 patacas through the new version of the “Macau Card for the Elderly”. Although the goodwill of the RAE government is evident, will it really improve the difficult situation of SMEs?
Currently, the difficulties faced by Macao's SMEs result from the enormous consumption of Macao residents in mainland cities and the challenges placed by changing their buying patterns. Compared to the various cities of the Great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay, operating costs, goods prices and sales services in Macau are at a disadvantage. For example, the price of 95 octane gasoline in mainland China is about 9 patacas per liter, while in Macao usually costs about 13 patacas. No wonder the drivers of Macao will return from the interior of China, with the car's deposit completely full. In addition, the stretch of Street of S. Paulo next to Rua da Palha is very busy, while more than a third of the stores ranging from Travessa da Paixão to Rua de Santo António are closed. What will help take the big prize to revitalize the economy of these streets and surroundings?
Given the adversities, the MSAR government shows the desire to change, but unfortunately there is still a significant space for an improvement in recognition and response to change. The crucial task is to break the monopoly of the installed interests.
Take as an example the Law of Economic Housing. At the time of the Portuguese Administration of Macao, Economic Housing served to resolve residents' housing issues and the owners of these homes were allowed to sell them, creating a market adjustment with properties at reasonable prices.
When I was deputy of the Legislative Assembly, the working group to which it belonged was responsible for the analysis of the specialty of the law entitled “Economic Housing Law”. The Legislative Assembly diary published that the deputies of the Association of Novo Macao, where I included myself, opposed the proposal to establish a deadline for the non -transferability of acquired economic housing and condition the purchase of economic housing by young people. With strong institutional support, the “Economic Housing Law” has passed, and subsequent revisions became increasingly strict. While some people have been satisfied because “economic housing has always to maintain the same nature, not being an investment”, but have you any idea how many young people were “enslaved by mortgages” when they bought home?
In Macao, only 3,600 babies were born in the dragon year (2024), a number less than 3,700 born in the rabbit year (2023). Some estimates point to 3,500 the number of those who will be born this year, and this number is already quite optimistic. But why is “denatality” gaining strength? Former Macao Chief Executive, Hau Wah, had the visionary idea of ​​proposing fractions of the “Mong In Building”, located at Francisco Xavier Pereira Street, to lease to newlyweds, providing young couples with a social housing option and relieving them from the heavy housing credit, allowing them to raise their children with peace of mind.
Unfortunately, Mr. Ho's proposal has not advanced and young people who want to marry and buy an apartment have no choice but to resort to the private real estate market. Even with their parents' help, young people have to pay mortgages over one million patacas! Now, with the decline real estate market, the apartments they bought are devalued. You should ask, how can they be willing to make babies?
Without breaking the double monopoly of economics and politics, we can only 'resign to destiny' instead of believing that 'my destiny is in my own hands'!</description><pubDate>2025-03-07 03:29:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Climate change and ocean currents</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/06/as-alteracoes-climaticas-e-as-correntes-oceanicas/</link><description>To facilitate the study of the complex system which is the climate, it has been considered considering it consisting of five components that interact with each other: atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, cryiosfera and biosphere.
The first two are the ones that most resent the behavior of a small part of the biosphere, ourselves. It is no longer new to anyone, except for negasters, that climate change is due to anthropogenic activities, which constitute the main cause of the injection of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
In these two components there are natural mechanisms that greatly contribute to climate balance: the general circulation of the atmosphere and oceanic circulation. It is up to both the task of distributing the globe the heat received from the sun in the form of radiation. It focuses more intensely in the regions of the low latitudes.
Without these natural mechanisms, the heat would be more concentrated in the equatorial and tropical regions, which would remain indefinitely to warm, while the cooling would not stop in higher latitudes either. General circulation of the atmosphere and oceanic circulation thus contribute to the balance of the climate system. Regarding the first, it is easily understandable that the fact that the air moves causes the heat to be distributed throughout the globe. The wind, in its most varied forms, has an important role in this process.
The jet currents, the wind winds, the monsoons, the breezes, the catabouts and anabetic winds, among other ways in which the wind occurs in nature, are in charge of this distribution of heat. Inserted in this mechanism, tropical cyclones (tropical storms, typhoons and hurricanes), characterized by very strong winds, greatly contribute to the transport of warm energy from the warmer to colder regions, as their trajectories, which start in low latitudes, statistically describe a kind of parable, progressing to higher latitudes.
For example, in western North Pacific, tuffles usually have their beginning in minor disturbances from the field of atmospheric pressure, between the Marian islands and the Philippines, progressing to the west, northwest, north, curving to the northeast and east, turning into extractical depressions. Hurricanes in the North Atlantic have similar behavior, usually beginning in minor pressure from the southern edge of the Azores anticyclone, near Cape Verde, progressing analogously for medium and high latitudes. Regardless of the sometimes catastrophic consequences of tropical cyclones, these meteorological phenomena play an indispensable role in the redistribution of heat, thus contributing to the balance of climate on a global scale.
In addition to the action of atmospheric circulation, oceanic circulation plays an important role in heat redistribution. In addition to the persistent winds, the temperature and salinity of water, and consequently their density, are factors that give rise to ocean currents, the behavior of which is sensitive to the variation of these parameters.
It is undeniable that global warming has caused the ice of the polar and glaciers, at an increasingly faster pace, causing freshwater resulting from the resulting sea to the sea, which could cause changes in current patterns that characterize ocean chains.
And this is where the attention of some scientists is focusing on, considering that the consequences of these changes are worrying, especially in the Atlantic Ocean. One of the recent studies refers to the implications that this process has in the so-called southern reversal circulation in the Atlantic Southern Overporting Circulation-AMOC), which includes the Gulf stream, which progresses from southern to the north, driven by the Azores anticyclone, transporting hot water from the Gulf of Mexico (Sorry, Mr. Trump) to regions to regions) to regions Neighbors on the east coast of the United States and northwestern Europe, positively conditioning the climate in these regions.
AMOC circulation consists of a chain system in the Atlantic, surface and in depth, through which hot and salty water (in the red figure) is transported from the tropical regions of the North Atlantic, from south to north, and which, when cooling, sinks, reversing its displacement to south, in depth. This process may suffer disruption due to the increasing influx of freshwater from the defrost, which causes the surface water dilution, which, thus diluted, would no longer sink due to its lower density, which could weaken the cold branch that flows in depth from north to south.
The pattern of circulation in the Pacific is different from the amoc, due, among others, to geographical factors. Instead of a strong deep return current, the surface -driven currents prevail by the surface.
Oceanic currents greatly contribute to climate balance. Once changed, imbalance in the climate system is generated, with consequences that may be serious for the sustainability of life on the globe. On this subject, studies were recently published, somewhat contradictory in the conclusions regarding the consequences of AMOC changes. According to scientists at the University of Copenhagen, according to a study prepared in 2023 and published in the scientific journal “Nature”, a collapse of Amoc may occur during this century, between the 2025 and 2095, with possible serious consequences for the North Atlantic climate. On the other hand, a work prepared by scientists from the “Met Office” (UK Meteorological Service) and the University of Exeter in 2024 is not so pessimistic. It argues that Amoc can be weakened, but its collapse is unlikely during this century.
In any case, these studies on ocean currents constitute one more alert with the consequences of global warming on climate system balance.

Computers Can't Convey How Foods and Drinks Taste and Smell… Yet ”.
Joshua Lurie
The intersection of geogostronomy and artificial intelligence (IA) presents a unique and transformative exploration of food cultures and culinary practices in various geographies. Geogogogosronomy merges geography and gastronomy, highlighting the impact of the place on the kitchen. It examines the factors that affect food, including climate, soil, culture and local traditions. This concept is not merely theoretical, but it encompasses practical realities. For example, the Mediterranean diet derives its uniqueness of the flora, climate and cultural practices of the region. The combination of food and place provides a basis for understanding how local ingredients shape culinary identities.
The evolution of this field can be tracked to the first anthropological efforts. Scholars like Claude Lévi-Strauss influenced this perspective by associating food with cultural identity. However, modern geogostronomy has expanded to include environmental issues. Topics such as biodiversity, sustainability and local agricultural practices are now essential in debates about food systems. AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence on programmed machines to think and learn. AI applications penetrated various sectors, including health care, finance and transport. In the culinary arts, the influence of AI is multifaceted. Technologies such as automatic learning, natural language processing and data analysis are reshaping the way we understand and produce food.
AI systems can analyze vast data sets to identify trends in food preferences, use of ingredients and nutritional information. This application is particularly valuable for cooking chiefs and food sector companies that intend to elaborate menus that correspond to consumers' preferences. The ability to quickly process and interpret data promotes innovation, as cooking professionals can do proof -based experiences and not just intuition. Modern tools, such as recipe generators and kitchen assistants, demonstrate AI potential. For example, IBM's IBM (Watson is the IBM AI platform that had already shown its expertise in “Jeopardy” and lung cancer treatment, and like Chef Watson, is helping IBM to achieve its mission to “help people discover new ideas” in this case for the kitchen) exemplifies how AI can create new recipes by analyzing thousands of culinary combinations.
When considering factors such as combinations of flavors and cooking techniques, Chef Watson facilitates a new era of cooking experimentation. Several important personalities have had a significant impact on the domains of geogostronomy and AI. Kitchen chief and writer Alice Waters is a prominent personality in promoting the “Quinta to the Table” movement, defending local supply and sustainable practices. Its influence demonstrates how attention given to geography can boost cooking innovation and improve the understanding of food sources and their meaning. In the technological domain, Andrew NG (founded and directed the Google Brain project and was chief scientist in the Chinese Baidu search giant, and directed the AI ​​lab at Stanford University) and Fe-Fe-Fe-Fe-Fe-Fe-President of IA/ML on Google Cloud and a member of the board and consultant in several public and private companies that is currently current Cofunder/CEO of World Labs which is an AI company focused on space intelligence and Generative AI).
Its contributions to automatic learning and deep learning have launched the bases for AI applications in various domains, including food technology. These advances allow chefs and food sector companies to adopt innovative approaches that fuse tradition with technology. In addition, several investigators and starting companies are exploring the intersection between AI and geogostronomy. Companies such as FlavorWiki analyze consumer taste preferences using AI -based analysis, helping food brands adapt products to specific regional tastes.
This combination of technology and culinary knowledge reflects a growing trend in recognizing the need for a data -based approach for food production and consumption. The integration of geogostronomy and AI promotes various perspectives, particularly around authenticity, sustainability and ethical considerations. Some critics argue that AI may dilute culinary authenticity. Traditional kitchen methods are often based on intuition and cultural transmission, which can be neglected in favor of data-based decisions. The essence of homemade kitchen, for many, is directly linked to personal stories, cultural meaning and unique rituals.
In addition, the dependence on technology raises questions about sustainability. Although AI can optimize food production, there is a risk of giving priority to efficiency over the preservation of traditional practices. The arguments that advocate a harmonious balance between modern technology and traditional practices suggest that AI should improve and not replace cultural heritage.
On the other hand, advocates of AI integration argue that technology can bring sustainability through data optimization. By predicting crop performance and analyzing soil health, AI can contribute to more efficient agricultural practices and waste reduction.</description><pubDate>2025-03-06 03:12:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Biennial | “Above Zobeida” to see until April 30</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/bienal-acima-de-zobeida-para-ver-ate-30-de-abril/</link><description>The exhibition that served to represent Macau at the 60th edition of the Venice Art Biennial will be available in the territory until April 30. The show, entitled “Above Zobeida: Art of Macao at the 60th International Art Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia” is available at the Macao Art Museum (MAM), and was inaugurated last Friday.
The project, by local artist Wong Weng Cheong, is inspired by Italo Calvino's “As Invisible Cities”. According to a note from the Cultural Institute (IC), it is a "a must-see exhibition that explores global issues from the perspective of Macao, questioning the identity in a heterotopy."
Leong Wai Man, president of the IC, declared, at the inauguration of the exhibition, that the participation of the territory in this Biennial in Venice aimed to "show Macau to the world", with "the creations of young participants in a skillfully mixed marks of everyday life in Macao with their experiences of study abroad, proposing a unique interpretation of the city's culture."
In Italo Calvino's novel, Zobeida is the name of the fictional city. For this exhibition, Wong Weng Cheong created an apocalyptic allegory of this same Zobeida, through "digital images and large installations," where "mutant creatures with elongated legs wandered between ruins buildings, creating a sense of surreal oppression and apocalyptic desolation."
The IC also describes that when the viewer enters the exhibition zone, which may most draw attention "it is the hidden surveillance chambers that incorporate the visitor's silhouettes into the work in real time, causing visitors to pass from external observers to observed figures."
Chang Chan, curator of the project, described that this conception is inspired by the theory of "heterotopia", by philosopher Michel Foucault, who "explores the established perception of the sense of belonging, intertwining reality with illusion."</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Holi Festival Macau | Event dedicated to Indian culture next Sunday</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/holi-festival-macau-evento-dedicado-a-cultura-indiana-no-proximo-domingo/</link><description>It takes place next Sunday, 16, at Galaxy, another edition of the Holi Macau Festival, an initiative of Indian culture that symbolizes the arrival of spring.

These feelings can be happiness, beauty, love, health or strength, starting a new time of year.
The purpose of this celebration is that everyone can have fun equally, without distinctions. Holi is one of the oldest celebrations in India, based on Hindu mythologies such as the legend of Krishna and Radha and a love that, at the outset, would be difficult to realize due to the differences in the skin's skin. However, Krishna decided to paint her face in various colors to get the same color as her beloved, so that they could be together.
Traditionally, on the eve of the festival, it is customary to gather branches or dried leaves, building bonfires to ward off the evil spirits and energies. When, the next morning, the heat goes out, it is time to start celebration on the streets, with colors, dances and joy, in which people launch the colorful powders.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:21:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Three artistic groups of Portugal at the Macao International Parade</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/07/tres-grupos-artisticos-de-portugal-no-desfile-internacional-de-macau/</link><description>Three artistic groups from Portugal will participate in the 11th edition of the Macao International Parade, which takes to the streets on March 23, was announced yesterday.
The director of the Macao Cultural Institute (ICM), Leong Wai Man, highlighted the “young percussion group” Porbatuka and the Portugal Artfusion project, which “mixture fado, Portuguese contemporary music and dance” in the show “Saudade”. At a press conference, the ICM revealed that the program also includes the Portuguese Company Theater Só, which will present the show “Sorriso”.
The parade will have about 1,800 artists, including 23 invited groups from 15 countries and regions, including Italy, Egypt, Polynesia, Morocco, Spain, India, France, Continental China and Hong Kong.
The ICM highlighted the show 'The Gipsy Marionettist' (The Gypsy puppet) by Rašid Nikolić, a gypsy artist born in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Argentine Folk Dance Group Argendance and a German circus group.

Caretos in Macau
Leong highlighted one of the local groups, Casa de Portugal in Macao, which will present a show inspired by the Caretos de Podence, which were in the region for the fifth edition of the parade in 2015.
The parade is one of the organized international events to mark the appointment of Macau as East Asia Cultural City 2025, a joint initiative of China, Japan and South Korea. The East Asia Cultural City initiative distinguishes two Chinese, one Japanese and one Korean cities annually. In addition to Macao, this year were chosen Huzhou, east of China, Kamakura, in downtown Japan, and Anseong, in the center of South Korea.

The action brought about in Hong Kong aims to pay costs and expenses of representation in a judicial process against the executor of Winnie Ho, Stanley Ho's deceased sister
 
Almost five years after Stanley Ho's death, court proceedings that arrive at the Hong Kong and Macau courts resulting from family disputes involving the tycoon of the tycoon.
According to Bloomberg agency, the latest court episode concerns the process brought by Stanley Ho's assets against 18 descendants of the tycoon to ensure the payment of costs and expenses arising from the representation of HO in another judicial process involving the dismissal of his late sister Winnie Ho.
Among the processed individuals, which include their children, highlighting President MGM China Holdings Ltd Pansy Ho and the founder of Nip Group Inc Mario Ho, as well as several grandchildren of SJM founder Holdings.
This last action was brought on Hong Kong by Patrick Cowley and Lui Yee Man from KPMG Advisory (Hong Kong) Ltd, Stanley Ho's heritage administrators. The pair of representatives are asking the court to grant them the right to defend Stanley Ho's assets in a judicial case against the Winnie Ho Heritage Executor, who died in 2018. In addition, compensation is requested to cover expenses and other costs.
Fraternal rivalry
In 2019, Winnie Ho's property executor sued Stanley Ho, his older sister Nanette Ho and the Macao Tourism and Entertainment Society (STDM) that controls the family's casino business.
The process that ran in the Macao courts was based on non -payment of dividends for more than a decade relating to STDM actions, which was managed several years by Stanley and Winnie. Dividends ascend to at least $ 1 billion from Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg News based on records.
At the turn of the century, with the end of the game monopoly in Macao and the creation of the concession system to explore industry in the territory, the two brothers were involved in an unprecedented struggle. Since 2006, Winnie Ho has established more than 30 cases in Macao and Hong Kong courts against Stanley Ho, related to debt, defamation cases or disputes on the property of social stakes in companies.
Stanley Ho was 98 when he died in 2020. He was the father of 17 children with different women, which gave rise to an extensive and complex family tree that culminated in a series of court disputes. He passed away without leaving a will and, given the impossibility of the family, reaching an agreement, a court eventually nominated the administrators of the Magnata's heritage, who has now sued the heirs.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:09:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Natural Gas | FINANCING REQUEST TO INCREASE SAFETY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/gas-natural-pedido-financiamento-para-aumentar-seguranca/</link><description>Recent fires led deputy Si Ka Lon to suggest greater implementation of natural gas supply, for safety reasons and also as part of environmental policies
 
Deputy Si Ka Lon advocates the widening of repair fund subsidies to the installation of pipes for the use of natural gas in housing buildings. The position was taken in a written interpellation, released on Friday.
After two fires occur in the last two weeks, which caused seven injuries, the deputy came to defend the need to adopt more security measures to avoid further occurrences. And one of the suggested measures is funded by the installation of natural gas distribution pipes in buildings: “Given the recent fires at TOI SAN and mud, which is suspected that at least one of the cases is related to a gas leakage, which shows the existing risks, the authorities are intended to accelerate the study to launch more security measures, such as the widening of building repair funding?” Lon.
Another of the deputy issues linked to the Fujian community indicates the need to “increase the level of knowledge of the population about natural gas” and promote greater use, given the benefits at the level of safety. “Will the government bet more on natural gas […] and the greatest use in Macau?” He asked.
The deputy points out that the natural gas distribution system is currently available in the territory, but that "it is mainly concentrated in the new public housing buildings or dealership hotels." Therefore, SI calls for an update of the numbers about the use of natural gas.
Willingness
As part of the explanations for the low implementation of natural gas, which by 2022 had 10,000 users, the legislator indicates that owners tend not to pay for installation works: “Small owners are usually not available to do the natural gas installation works, due to the high initial costs and the unclear return,” he explained. "The necessary incentive measures are urgent for more residents to benefit from natural gas safety," he said.
At the argument of security, Si Ka Lon also joins the importance of reducing carbon emissions, according to the environmental plans of MSAR.
In this sense, the deputy asks if there are plans for the proportion of the energy acquired to Zhuhai come from non -fossil sources. “Currently, the proportion of non -fossil energy in the electricity acquired by Macau is greater than 40 percent. Authorities stated that before the contract ended in 2026 that there will be discussions to 'gradually increase the percentage'. When will the negotiation be done? ”He asked.
Si Ka Lon also wants to know if there are goals set for five or 10 years, about reducing the proportion of imported energy generated by fossil fuels.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:07:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | More foreign gamblers increase tax exemption</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/07/jogo-mais-apostadores-estrangeiros-aumentam-isencao-de-imposto/</link><description>Without revealing the value of Game Tax Growth, Helena de Senna Fernandes indicates that there is a new trend, which results from the efforts of the concessionaires and the government to internationalize the market
 
The government stated that the increase in the number of foreign players in Macao led to the approval of more requests for exemption from payment tax payment. The revelation was made by the Director of Tourism Services, Helena de Senna Fernandes, in response to an interpellation of Deputy Lei Chan U.
“The amount approved in relation to the reducing or exemption of contributions presented by the gaming or unlucky concessionaries last year, due to the expansion of foreign customer markets, recorded an increase compared to 2023,” read the response released at the end of last month. "According to data from the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC), in 2024, the number of international visitors increased 66 percent in annual terms," ​​he was added.
Despite mentioning the increase in tax exemption, the response signed by Helena de Senna Fernandes does not indicate any data on the size of the increase, besides the percentage rise of international visitors.
The most recent changes to the game law have allowed dealers to get an exemption up to 5 percent on the game tax, in the revenues generated by international players. Currently, the game's revenues pay a 40 percent tax.
Greater promotion
The absence of data has not prevented the government's representative from indicating that evolution has been driven by concessionaires by “providing diverse and quality services” for international tourists, such as the segregation of these players, the expansion of delegations abroad to promote Macao as a tourist destination, the preferred offers for international visitors and the launch of more private flights.
Helena de Senna Fernandes also explains that these efforts have been reconciled with those of the government for the most active promotion of masters as a tourist destination. In the document, the director of tourism services also reveals that in 2025 the objective of the promotion of tourism of Macao passes through the market of Northeast Asia, in countries such as South Korea or Japan.
In addition, the promotion will start over in Europe, the United States, India and the Middle East. These markets join Greater China and Southeast Asia, where efforts have been intensified in recent years. The promotion of Macao as a tourist destination is also participating in international tourism fairs in places such as Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea.</description><pubDate>2025-03-07 03:13:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Government enhances sensitization for burles abroad</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/07/governo-realca-sensibilizacao-para-burlas-no-estrangeiro/</link><description>Continues the government's prevention campaign to alert the population to the dangers of crime organized abroad and the Southeast Asia centers. The Director of Tourism Services (STD), Helena de Senna Fernandes, compiled the work of various departments of administration, and police forces, raising awareness of the danger of organized crime networks dedicated to telephone and cyber circums.
In response to an interpellation by Deputy Leong Hong Sai, Helena de Senna Fernandes states that “to sensitize Macau residents to take into account when they move abroad,” STD distributed, through travel agency associations, information leaflets and produced a video with safety tips for outside travel. These materials recommend to residents the prior planning of itineraries, contract travel insurance, preparation for the various types of payment used on site, keep passports in safe places and maintain contact with family and friends during the trip. The guardian also highlights the importance of residents becoming aware of the risks they can find.
In addition, it is stressed that the government has an internet page that launches travel and information alerts, “including those provided by the China Popular Republic Embassy in Thailand, warning Chinese citizens” to the importance of care to be taken before traveling abroad.
Informative combat
Helena de Senna Fernandes mentions an extended network of administrative entities, in addition to STD, such as the directions of Justice and Youth Education and Education Services and the Judicial Police (PJ), which has warned of the danger of these organized crime networks.
The official stresses a PJ-organized press conference in December last year, which aimed to spread information on the subject, as well as “sending anti-mood messages through official police social networking accounts” appealing to public surveillance. An awareness campaign was also launched in the school network to sensitize parents and students to the danger of fraudulent schemes.</description><pubDate>2025-03-07 03:12:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Road Works | Better Quality Floor Request</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/07/obras-rodoviarias-pedido-pavimento-de-melhor-qualidade/</link><description>The deputy of the workers, Leong Sun Iok, asks for fines for contractors who are late in the works, better quality in the work and adoption of more resistant floors, as happens in Hong Kong
 
Leong Sun IOK argues that the government should follow Hong Kong's example and adopt a more quality and resistance road floor. The subject is part of a written interpellation in which the deputy of the workers is concerned about the quality of the roads and the works.
According to the member of the Legislative Assembly, the heavy vehicles in circulation of the territory exert great pressure on local roads, which combined with traffic flow, contributes to faster wear of paving. For this reason, Leong indicates that the “conventional asphalt pavement can hardly meet the pressure of current traffic”, which leads to the emergence of “holes and irregularities”.
At the same time, Leong Indicates points out the example of Hong Kong, where a new “experimental title” pavement has begun to be used, with “favorable” results that show greater resistance to wear resistance. Therefore, the deputy wants to know if the executive will follow the example: “In the future, the government has any plan to introduce more innovative materials and technologies and increase technical standards and requirements for road quality control, in order to improve road quality and durability?” He asks.
Quality of works
On the other hand, the legislator is concerned with the quality of some works carried out, especially when larger projects are performed by phases. According to Leong, asphalt often has irregularities, which becomes dangerous, especially for motorcycles.
“In order to minimize the impact on residents in recent years, the major works in Macau have been usually done by phases. However, the surfaces of the repaired roads were not well linked, which resulted in unevenness and even holes in various dimensions, ”he shot. “I can ask the competent services how they will improve the work process to ensure that road floors in various phases can converge gently and effectively solve the existing problem of irregular road floors?” He asks.
Still in relation to road works, the deputy intends to know that measures are being adopted by the executive to penalize the contractors who are delayed in the works, although they promise shorter deadlines. "Road excavation is sometimes inevitable, but it is also precisely due to the persistence of road works that traffic traffic, air pollution, etc., which affect residents' behavior in terms of travel and their quality of life," he said. "What sanctions were applied when there were delays in the works?"</description><pubDate>2025-03-07 03:11:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Government launches new alert about Covid-19</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/06/governo-lanca-novo-alerta-sobre-covid-19/</link><description>Macao health services (SS) indicate a decrease in influenza cases, with the current situation “below the alert level”. However, in the case of COVID-19 infections, “the Sars-Cov-2 virus is becoming active,” therefore an appeal to vaccination, especially for chronic and elderly patients. The SS advance, however, that no death caused by Covid-19 has not yet been registered since the beginning of the year.
According to a note released yesterday, which cites laboratory data from the ninth week of the year, that is, from late February, “the Covid-19 detection positivity rate was 13.7 percent”, and this value “represents a significant increase compared to the previous week, 3.8 percent”.
In general terms, SS believe that “flu activity will remain active in the coming weeks”, but the attention, but for a certain stability. The number of patients served in the emergency service in the ninth week of 2025, that is, February, “decreased from the previous week”, having been attended a daily average of 1,190 people, 282 of them children.
Thus, “the descent trend of the influenza virus detection rate, from 10.5 percent in the eighth week of the year (below the alert level of 13.1 percent), to five percent in the ninth week”.
RISE IN DAILY AVERAGE
However, the SS warns that it is not yet time to ward off attention from flu, as it is “an average of about 83 [sick] people per day, which represents an climb compared to previous data”. Of these 83 people, 31 are adults and 52 children. Thus, the SS understands that "the spread of the respiratory tract virus in Macau is still active."

This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

In practice, the measure aims mainly to “canola”, a plant developed in Canada, related to the colza and used, namely, to produce food oil and feed for animals. The US country is one of the world's leading producers and China is one of its main customers.
Last year, Canada announced the imposition of additional customs rights on certain products manufactured in China: 100 percent on electric vehicles and 25 percent on steel and aluminum products. Beijing promised to react, but at the time expressed his firm opposition to these measures, considering them protectionists.
A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Trade declared on Saturday that an anti-discrimination inquiry launched on September 26 concluded that Canadian taxes “damaged” Chinese companies and “affected the normal order of commerce”, which led China to retaliate.
"Added customs rights of 100 percent to colza oil, oilseeds and peas will be applied," said the Chinese government customs customs agenda in a separate statement. A 25 percent surcharge will also be imposed on water products and pork. These customs rights will come into force on 20 March.
Unstable relationships
"Canadian measures constitute a serious violation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, are clearly protectionists and discriminate against China," the commission said.
"China urges Canada to immediately correct its bad practices, raise its restrictive measures and eliminate its negative effects," the Ministry of Commerce stressed in the press release. Canadian surcharges apply to cars produced in China, trucks, buses, electric distribution vans and certain hybrid models.
Relations between Otava and Beijing have been in conflict for several years, notably since the Huawei crisis and the detention in 2018 of Meng Wanzhou, the Chinese group's financial director, followed by arrest in China of two Canadians.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:27:43</pubDate></item><item><title>APN | National Legislature holds 2nd Plenary Meeting</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/apn-legislatura-nacional-realiza-2-a-reuniao-plenaria/</link><description>The third session of the 14th National Popular Assembly (APN), the China National Legislature, held its second plenary meeting on Saturday to deliberate on working reports of the 14th APN, the Supreme Popular Court (STP) and Supreme Popular Attorney (SPP).
Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders, including Li Qiang, Wang Huning, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, Li Xi and Han Zheng, attended the meeting, the People's Diary. Zhao Leji, chairman of the APN Permanent Committee, presented the National Legislature's work report at the meeting.
Reviewing the work of the highest legislature in 2024, Zhao highlighted his commitment to strengthen the implementation of the Constitution and increase the supervision of compliance to maintain the authority and inviolability of the Constitution.
Regarding the use of its legislative functions to improve the Chinese socialist legal system, the national legislature deliberated on 39 legislative items last year, of which 24 were adopted, including six new laws and 14 laws revised, Zhao said. The national legislature legally exercised its duty of supervision, said Zhao, adding that he listened and decided on 21 reports from the State Council, the National Supervision Commission, STP and SPP.
Zhao mentioned that the national legislature also intensified efforts to support legislators in fulfilling their duties according to the law, including helping legislators to maintain narrow ties with the people.
By presenting the Supreme Court's work report, STP President Zhang Jun said Chinese courts at all levels accepted more than 46 million cases and completed more than 45 million cases by approximately the same level as the previous year.
Zhang said that the courts in 2025 will make new and further contributions to promote law -based governance on all fronts and build a socialist country under the rule of law at a higher level.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:15:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Taiwan | Beijing threatens to squeeze “the loop”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/taiwan-pequim-ameaca-apertar-o-laco/</link><description>The Chinese Armed Forces warned yesterday that they will squeeze "the tie" around Taiwan if separatism becomes stronger, urging Taiwan's supporters to avoid the "cliff," the state press said.

China's surplus in trade with the rest of the world was set at $ 170.52 billion in the first two months of the year. China's customs publish commercial data for January and February together to avoid any distortion due to Lunar New Year, which takes place every year on different days.
"Export growth covered in the first two months of 2025, with the anticipation of fees to give less impetus for what we had had," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics consultant.
"This slowdown occurs before any substantial impact of the rates, which will almost certainly lead to sharp declines on exports to the US soon," he said. Springs of imports suggests that increased demand driven by government expenses at the end of last year "has already been inverted partially," Evans-Pritchard said.
This week, the second of two increases of 10 percent in the rates imposed by US President Donald Trump on China imports, which should affect Chinese exports in the coming months.
Chinese buyers and suppliers rushed to complete business, to avoid the impact of fees.
Chinese authorities have confidence in the resistance of the economy and the fact that trade with other countries could help compensate for any export reductions to the US after the rates. Beijing also stated that he is open to conversations with Washington on a basis of mutual respect.
Jumps and falls
Last year, exports helped China reach its 5 percent economic growth target. Beijing once again set the goal by about 5 percent, despite the uncertainties of commercial perspectives for this year.
Exports to the US grew by 2.3 percent, in homologous terms, in January-February, while exports to the European Union and Japan grew only 0.6 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. As exportações para a Rússia caíram 10,9 por cento.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations continued to be China's largest commercial partner, with exports to grow 5.7 percent, in homologous terms.
"Although it is not very important for a few months of data, the office raises questions about how export trends can change when rates start to affect the US as well," said Lynn Song of Ing Economics in a report. "With fees to come into force in February and March, it is likely that the impact will be felt gradually in the coming months," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:13:40</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Beijing warns that “no war can be won”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/07/eua-pequim-avisa-que-nenhuma-guerra-pode-ser-ganha/</link><description>China warned yesterday that "no war can be won," in response to statements by US Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, on US military preparation for any conflict with the Asian nation.
China's Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lin Jian, accused Washington of "deliberately inciting ideological confrontation" and exaggerating the alleged "Chinese threat."
"We urge the United States to stop imposing their hegemonic logic on China, abandoning their obsolete Cold War mindset and refraining from using 'strategic competition' as a pretext for containing and repressing China," Lin said at a press conference.
The statements appear a day after Hegseth claimed in a television interview that the US does not want a war with China, but that “those who want peace must prepare for war,” thus justifying the military reinforcement ordered by President Donald Trump.
The American official thus reacted to the Chinese embassy in the United States, who warned on Wednesday that if the US "wants a war, whether it is tariff, commercial or other," China is "ready to fight to the end."
Beijing has repeatedly rejected Washington's arguments that he needs to reinforce his armed forces to cope with a possible Chinese military threat. The exchange of statements arises at a time of growing tensions between the two powers, marked by commercial disputes and mutual accusations on security and geopolitical issues.</description><pubDate>2025-03-07 03:20:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Alibaba | Actions rise 7% after announcing a new AI model</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/07/alibaba-accoes-sobem-7-apos-anunciar-novo-modelo-de-ia/</link><description>Chinese technology actions Alibaba yesterday rose nearly 7 percent after revealing a new artificial intelligence model, with a similar performance to DeepSeek's R1, but much more effective in data used.
The company's actions on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange rose 6.93 percent during yesterday morning's session, setting the appreciation so far this year in more than 70 percent, thanks to the impulse of AI, a segment in which Alibaba, initially focused on electronic trade, is now betting strongly.

Alibaba's climb on the stock market, according to analysts cited by Bloomberg, is due to the rise of Chinese Ia and the positive prospects for its cloud computing business, but also to the support promised by Beijing to consumption, which could reinforce its traditional electronic trade business.
Last week, Alibaba announced that it will spend at least 380 billion Yuan over the next three years on AI and cloud infrastructures, more than the investment combined in these two strategic domains in the last decade.

China's robotics technology gave a “jump”, and the difference with international developments and standards “decreased significantly”, yesterday defended an expert, on the sidelines of the plenary session of the country's maximum legislative agency.
At a press conference, Qiao Hong, a robot industry expert at the Chinese Science Academy, highlighted the rapid progress made by China and the strategic importance of robotics for the country's economic future.
Until about a decade ago, China imported almost all the industrial robots used in its factories. In 2024, internal production increased by 14.2 percent, in homologous terms, to 556,000 units, according to data cited by Qiao.
A robot is any machine capable of automatically performing a number of tasks, and includes robotic arms, autonomous cars or non -manned military vehicles.
But Qiao also highlighted the country's advances in the humanoid robot segment, which can use tools and operate in human environments such as homes, hospitals or homes of elderly.
The use of these robots, with head, trunk, arms and legs, in factories and warehouses, converges with the development of artificial intelligence systems, such as the Chinese deepseek platform, and can compensate for the rapid aging of China's population, which is assumed as a country of "non -imigration".
“Humanoid robots are expected to become the next revolutionary innovation to follow computers, mobile phones and new energy vehicles, profoundly transforming production, human lifestyles and global industrial landscape,” reads a recent direction by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technologies of China (MIIT).
The humanoid robot market in China reached approximately 2.76 billion yuan in 2024, according to Qiao Hong.
The expert highlighted the “comprehensive industrial system” and the “robust supply chain”, which allows the country to effectively produce the components and complete equipment of the machines needed for the robots.
Qiao also pointed to the scale of the domestic market. “China has a huge demand for robot applications in sectors such as transformative industry, logistics and services. This vast dimension of the market and the diversity of application scenarios in China offer a continuous impulse for the interactive update of robot technology, ”he said.
FRIENDS MANUFACTED
The ministry indicated that by 2027 humanoid robots must be integrated into the production chains “on a large scale” and their wide use to “whole society”. “Progress should be achieved in developing hands, arms and robotic feet, as well as the integration of artificial intelligence,” reads the document.
The National Popular Assembly (APN), the China's maximum legislative agency whose annual session runs until March 11, is described by the official press as the “supreme organ of state power in China” and the “maximum expression of socialist democracy”. This week, the delegates will pass new laws, political appointments and government reports, which detail the progress of various departments and ministries.</description><pubDate>2025-03-07 03:18:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Brazil | China suspends imports of beef of three factories</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/06/brasil-china-suspende-importacoes-de-carne-de-bovino-de-tres-fabricas/</link><description>China temporarily suspended imports of beef from three Brazilian factories, announced yesterday the government of Brazil, ensuring that the decision will not affect bilateral trade relations.

Asked about the sale of Balboa and Cristobal ports by Hong Kong Ck Hutchison Conglomerate to a consortium led by American Blackrock, Lin refused to comment and recalled that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Government has already spoken on the issue.
The agreement, valued at $ 22.8 billion, also includes the transfer of CK Hutchison's participation in 43 other ports from 23 countries, although it excludes terminals in China and Hong Kong.</description><pubDate>2025-03-06 03:05:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Debbie Lai, director of the center of the good shepherd | “Victims need more protection”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/debbie-lai-directora-do-centro-do-bom-pastor-vitimas-precisam-de-mais-proteccao/</link><description>Regarding International Women's Day, which was celebrated around the world on Saturday, HM talked to Debbie Lai, director of the center of the good shepherd, one of the entities that welcomes victims of domestic violence in the territory. The official defends speed in investigations of cases of domestic violence and more days of maternity leave
 
 
Regarding domestic violence, the law remains not revised, with many cases where it cannot be accused or condemned the aggressor. What needs to be changed in current legislation?
You should accelerate the time spent in investigating the case, as well as to make a simple promotion of the law, to let people understand what they will face if they report the situation to the police. There is still afraid of the complaint to the police, so what happens is that the aggressor, before a complaint, gets angry, again committing violence and the family is departed.
How many women are currently at the center of the good shepherd?
According to the License of Service granted by the Institute of Social Action (IAS), we can welcome 14 people, including children. We currently have 11 people, six women, three children and two girls living in our center. Some of these women have problems due to emotional conflicts, and although they already have some stability at this level, they continue to have financial difficulties. Many of these women are not permanent residents, so they are unable to apply for government social housing, and they need more time to save money to pay an income in Macao, which is not cheap. If young children exist, it is harder for them to find a full -time job, so these women cannot move in a short time for a home, staying in our center a year. And in this situation, the center cannot have more empty rooms to help other women in crisis.
Do you consider that more reception centers are needed for victims of violence in Macau, or more resources to ensure the victim's safety, since the territory is so small?
I think the resources are sufficient, but the investigation process is time consuming. Victims need more protection, as there is always the risk that the perpetrator continues to threaten them.
What is necessary to increase the birth rate and ensure that women continue to have access to equal economic and employment opportunities?
Promotion needs to be continuous, and should increase maternity leave, as in other countries there are more maternity leave. The monthly value of day care centers could also be decreased. The attribution of a subsidy by each child could also be considered if the family has financial problems.
There is a lack of support for single -padded families, where women are alone with dependent children, or where women are caregivers? In concrete terms, what needs to be improved?
I think yes. I think some of them do not know that there are resources in society to help them, or may not have motivation to seek help. Many of these women also do not want to rely on government, not even non -governmental associations or organizations that provide services to the family. But these women can always apply for the subsidy attributed by the Institute of Social Action, which gives them some money and allows you to stay at home to take care of their children.
How do you describe women in Macao currently, especially the Chinese community? Are you more emancipated and equal to men regarding their rights?
Nowadays the capacity of women has changed a lot, as they have equal opportunities and the right to develop. Many local companies are already chaired by women, for example. In addition to having physical strength, they can choose their jobs, attend higher education, marry and have the ability to take leadership positions. However, there are many women who come to Macau and marry residents and have a lower social position, suffering from various family problems. I speak of machismo that still exists, the addiction of the game, situations of toxicodependence or lack of communication. There are men who control everything, creating a climate in which the wife has to hear her husband and is devoid of self-esteem to get out of this situation. In such cases, it is very easy to have discussions, conflicts and even cases of violence between the couple. These are situations that obviously also affect their children.
International Women's Day celebrated in Macau
International Women's Day was celebrated in Macao in very diverse ways. In the case of Sands China, flowers were offered to the operator's workers as a way of expressing “the appreciation for the indispensable contributions that women make in the workplace, in the family and society”, can read in a company statement. It was also organized a debate that focused on the issues around women, organized by the Sands Empowher volunteer team, a “global initiative of diversity and inclusion led by women, which aims to connect the team's female members to create network job opportunities”. This event was broadcast live on Sands China's various digital platforms.
Sands Empowher is, above all, to organize training and mentoring actions so that women can develop in professional and career terms.
In the same note, it states that the company “is committed to building and maintaining a workplace with respect and equality”, defending and guaranteeing women's rights. Regarding sexual harassment, Sands states that it has carried out a campaign to prevent cases since July 2018, as well as actions that reduce cases of discrimination against women.
This was “the first in Macao”, and a “training action with all team members” on these themes was also carried out. Regarding support for maternity, "the company also offers breastfeeding rooms for mothers and performs a wide variety of activities for parents and children to promote family harmony."
At the Portuguese School of Macao, International Women's Day was celebrated on Friday with the DAC project-“Women who inspire”, an initiative organized by the teachers of the disciplines of Portuguese, Philosophy and Mathematics, among others. The 10th grade students have developed several works on inspiring women in the most diverse areas. One of them was the recently deceased poet Maria Teresa Horta.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 03:54:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Bernardo Mendia, Chamber of Commerce and Industry Portugal - Hong Kong: “Portugal should extend your hand”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/06/bernardo-mendia-camara-de-comercio-e-industria-portugal-hong-kong-portugal-deve-estender-a-mao/</link><description>The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry of Hong Kong, Sun Dong, arrives today, accompanied by entrepreneurs from digital areas, online trade and technology. Bernardo Mendia, Mayor of Commerce and Industry Portugal - Hong Kong, highlights the importance of visiting Portuguese companies and Raehk as a complement to Portuguese contacts in Macau
 
 
Last year, Portugal was visited by Christopher Hui Ching-Yu, Secretary of Hong Kong Financial Affairs and Treasury, and now another Hong Kong ruler passes through Portugal. Is it a visit with added meaning?
As a Chamber of Commerce and Industry Portugal - Hong Kong we consider this visit extremely important, valuing the attention that is being given to Portugal. It is important, above all, because it is such a specific area as innovation. This is an area where Hong Kong bets a lot and has been a priority for the region's authorities, and this is something that exists in common with Portugal, which has also bet on technological and scientific development. What Portugal should do is take this opportunity, extend your hand to the secretary and work in partnership. Technological and economic development is only done with international partnerships, opening markets and collaborations. This is also what we promote as a Chamber of Commerce. We have been involved in organizing this trip, something that started months ago. We will lead Portuguese companies to identify potential synergies with the entities that come here, so that they know each other and then do their work.
Hong Kong has been present in all editions of Websummit in Lisbon. Does this visit give the idea that the region intends to expand and establish more concrete partnerships with Portugal?
Yes, no doubt. This has evidenced in official speeches of the most important members of the Hong Kong government, including the executive's own head. This is the region's strategy at this time, being a bridge for the rest of the world to be able to enter Asia. Then the territory competes with other platforms, as Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo are perhaps the three territories with the greatest expression in this [technological] area in Asia. But Hong Kong presents the best conditions, not only for the support it gives [to companies], but also for being part of China, despite having a different legal system and a different currency. There is a system completely open at the level of capital circulation and internet access. I think Hong Kong is better positioned in this field, but this is a competition that the territory has to do, such as Portugal when it will perform in Asia, competing with Spain and other European countries in attracting foreign direct investment.
Macao is usually the main connection to Portugal, for historical reasons and the presence of the Portuguese language. Can Hong Kong also be a binding territory between Portuguese companies and Asia?
Macau and Hong Kong are very complementary in this regard. Macao has this historical connection with Portugal and has very important companies based in the territory, some of them for over 100 years, namely the National Bank Overseas. This experience, and the fact that the Portuguese language is still official, is undoubtedly an advantage for Portuguese companies. If it is necessary to enter the capital market, Portuguese companies will opt for a number of services provided by Hong Kong. But Macau has its own advantages and I consider it two very complementary markets. The geographical proximity of Macau and Hong Kong also acts as an attractive point.
During Christopher Hui Ching-Yu's visit last year, Hong Kong's position as Fiscal Paradise was addressed. How do you look at this question?
This visit is organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office and the tax issues will now be set aside. But our position, as a Chamber of Commerce, is that it makes no sense Hong Kong being on the list of tax havens, and makes no sense or from a legal point of view. None of the markets we compete with Hong Kong as a fiscal paradise, nor the European Union itself. We just have to lose with it, because we create barriers to trade and foreign direct investment in Portugal, and also the investment that is made by Portuguese companies in Macao, which are eventually affected by it. It makes no sense to this designation from a legal point of view, because Hong Kong does not gather the conditions to be part of the list of tax havens, and from the political point of view because no other European country puts the territory in this category.
China is present in the Portuguese market through various investments. Hong Kong is trying to create its own way?
Not in these terms. The overwhelming majority of Chinese investment that is made in Portugal is through Hong Kong. Then, in this respect, Hong Kong and China work in a quite complementary way. Hong Kong acts as a "aircraft carrier" from China in terms of foreign investment, and there is no competition between the two, working, together.
Encounters in Oeiras | Taguspark today hosts exchange sessions and seminars
Dong Sun is accompanied by Portugal by Hong Kong's most important companies and entities in the areas of innovation, technology and digital media, either government, with Hong Kong Science and Technology Park and “Cyberport”, technology park with budget projects in two billion Hong Kong; either academic and research, attending the entourage of the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute and “Hong Kong Microelectronics Research and Development Institute”.
Exchange sessions and seminars take place today from 4 pm at Taguspark, Oeiras, where Oeiras Valley Investment Agency is located, whose representatives have already been present in Macao for commercial contacts.
In the afternoon there will be the opportunity for dialogue between the Secretary of Hong Kong, representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Portugal - Hong Kong and leaders of Raehk's technological parks and institutes, and in total 24 companies are represented.
In the Catalan road
In a statement issued by the Hong Kong executive, it is read that the program includes “meetings and exchanges with leaders of local political, business and innovation and technology sectors”, as well as visits to infrastructure, technological parks, research institutes and businesses.
The aim is to “reinforce ties and cooperation” with Portugal in this sector, “promoting the advantages of Hong Kong innovation and technology and exploring business opportunities abroad,” according to the statement.
Before passing through Lisbon, the delegation was in Barcelona to participate in the “Mobile World Congress”, considered one of the most influential technological events worldwide.
This is the second visit to Portugal of a member of the Hong Kong government within a year, after the secretary for financial services and treasure had passed through Lisbon in June. At the time, Christopher Hui Clay-Yu asked Portugal to remove Hong Kong from the list of tax havens and argued that it already fulfills the European Union standards to combat tax dropout.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Cristina Rocha Leiria, author of the project of the Ecumenical Center Kun Aím: “The work that most filled me”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/cristina-rocha-leiria-autora-do-projecto-do-centro-ecumenico-kun-iam-a-obra-que-mais-me-preencheu/</link><description>Until March 13 can be seen at the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center, the show “Moments of Light With Kun Iam”, an exhibition by Cristina Rocha Leiria, architect, sculptor and author of the center project.

Tell me “moment of light”, the exhibition patent at the Kun Iam ecumenical center.
The center was created for silence, because everything is done for majorities, but we have to think about minorities, which have the right to exist. There may be a minority that needs silence. Crystals are seen from Portugal and also purchased in China, chosen by me, and energy stones. There are also 25 pieces made by Atlantis [Portuguese Company of the Vista Alegre Group] in Cristal, as well as a bazaar with other materials.
The ecumenical center was inaugurated in 1999, 25 years passed. How do you look at the project today? Do you feel that you are properly used?
It is the work that filled me the most. I worked on it at the level of architecture, because this is my training area, and I also worked with the sculpture because it is what I do, although I did not take any course. I sculpture as therapy. I worked at the level of music with Kyao and another conductor, who realized what I wanted and made a composition of such order that plays all day [in the center] and people never get tired. I treated, at the time, everything else, the decoration and what was sold there. Things have been running out and there was almost nothing to sell except for some books and postcards. We created a lot that sold, the tourists went there, made no noise because they realized it was a place of silence, bought and this space had a certain performance. This ecumenical center should be disclosed, which has become a former Macao Libris, with tourists as Macau has and that exists in any other urban place in the world. Therefore, the center works at this time with an exhibition of mine and a bazaar that has products that sell themselves in other places and that have nothing to do with the ecumenical center, but are a gimmick.
How was the start of the construction of this project? Have you ever done anything so much with so much connection with the spirit world?
I lived in Mozambique until I went to Lisbon to study architecture. As a child I know the goddess Kun Age, because my mother had a white statue of Kun ran home, and it was the thing I liked the most in that house. Little did I know that one day I would make a center dedicated to this goddess. When I came to Macau to work in the Leal Senate, as the president's advisor, with the first money I earned I went to Hong Kong to buy a white Abat-Jour with the figure of Kun Iam, which I still have today. Regarding the spiritual part, it comes from a child, I always liked the silence. When I do architecture or sculpture it is always in complete silence. I am only me linked to work and a world that, as it is not tangible, many people do not even realize it, do not believe him. I believe because I feel that when I work two nightsless nights, or three days in a row, in any project, silent, I wake up in the morning and I think of the ideas I had, I am surprised even with them. So the spiritual part is reflected in the sculpture I make. I specialize in housing and spirituality is also reflected in the projects I did in Macao in the area of ​​social housing. Spirituality is a part of me, and the ecumenical center is guided to it. In these guided tours that I have tried to pull for younger people to realize that we can be greatly helped by energies that we do not see. I do not name things and say not to care about it, because the important thing is to become aware that there is more than what we see. The material world is not the only one who interests us, there is more to make contact and thank.
Macao is a territory based on consumption, the game, the excesses. Having a center of this nature in this society has a greater meaning?
This center is ecumenical, but it has nothing to do with the church, referring to something comprehensive. The center was made for atheists, agnostic, religious and non -religious, for all those who need silence. And in the world of Macao, or in large urban media, there is always hearing pollution. This center was made on an island that I asked for the governor of the time, General Vasco Rocha Vieira, who was a very open person to this proposal. This island was created because there was no space in Macau at the time to place a 20 meter high monument. The center became a symbol, many will pray there, but it was not done for it. I must say that I believe that the essence of the divine is in each of us, but not everyone is aware of it. Others are open to this essence.
Returning to the exhibition. What can people learn from her?
I am now in Macao for a period of six months, but I have also dealt with various projects related to projects I have done in Portugal for many years and I have been trying to be recovered. The exhibition itself is there and is not an attractive. It is good to know that the reopening of the ecumenical center did not have the disclosure it should have. No one knows that the ecumenical center has been opened, and who appears there are the people who leave the children in the parks, watch the space, and go there with the children. It is interesting because the little ones go precisely to the energy points identified by me. People who are walking, come in, but will not be on purpose to see my exhibition. Then, as they see the gate that gives the river, they leave soon and the exhibition goes unnoticed.
But regrets that no more dissemination has been made.
It was not done, no. Now I am doing this job and spreading with friendly people. I am finishing an exhibition without, in fact, people have enjoyed when I have sculptures with messages. It takes about a month to sculpture, and I write, thinking, doing poetry, so I have a lot to convey to people about each sculpture. Many people say they get out of there richer. I will ask the exhibition to be prolonged beyond March 13th and it was good to happen, because there have been groups of people, including some that mark time with me and I will make the guided tour.
How did your connection come to Chinese culture?
This connection comes from childhood. Then I deepened this connection a lot because I had to study about the goddess Kun Iam. I had to see many figures of Kun were going to think how it would do one that was suspended there, outdoors subject to taps and strong winds, as well as high temperatures. The spiritual part was easier for me, because since childhood I am interested in oriental philosophies. This part of spirituality [in the construction of the ecumenical center] was easier for me, although it had many difficulties. I gave myself everything, books to the library, and even contributed financially to this center so that many young people could enjoy it.
He told me that some works he has built need recovery. Is this side of the artist ungrateful to see the projects to destroy themselves over time without preservation?
I don't regret anything, I try to understand. But I also try to defend the purposes that existed in the start of each project. I try to understand the way of being of the Chinese who lived so many years limited and with many prohibitions. I would like to understand why they put a bazaar at the exhibition to sell so many products. The same happens in Portugal: I have the work “Candle to the Wind” in Tavira, in a huge roundabout that had a lake, it was something I tried to do poeticly, but then I see that people despise. Now there is no water in space and herbs grow. I feel that there is a lack of respect for the artist.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 23:35:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Jimson Kun Wa Koi, President of the Macau Young Symphony Orchestra: “Macau is a culture space”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/jimson-kin-wa-hoi-presidente-da-orquestra-sinfonica-jovem-de-macau-macau-e-um-espaco-de-cultura/</link><description>The President of the Macao Youth Symphonic Orchestra, Jimson Kin Wa Hoi, defends support for classical music and young people. At the head of the orchestra two decades ago, the official reveals to HM details about the next concerts, including a passage in Portugal and the “24th Concert of the New Generation of Musicians 2025”, scheduled for this Sunday at the Cultural Center of Macau
 
Image: António Sanmfaurn_MacauNews
Let's start talking about the show at the Great Auditorium of the Macao Cultural Center (CCM) this Sunday. It is a great opportunity to reveal your project to the public.
Yes. In fact, the orchestra has existed since 1997, almost 28 years ago. Throughout this time we held about 100 concerts, in what we call Macao signature shows. The new generation of local musicians is indeed quite enthusiastic about the show we will have next Sunday.
Conducting concerts and participation in festivals is the most visible part of your project. But how many musicians are they currently on the orchestra? To what extent is the orchestra important for young people who want to be musicians?
We are indeed the only youth orchestra in Macao that provides specific training in this musical genre. At this stage, young musicians may have the opportunity to show their talent. We really try to build a new generation of musicians. This type of show encourages them to learn and go out more, studying music over the years, so it's really very important to them. In Sunday's show, musicians will have the opportunity to play in orchestra, and this year we organized two auditions to choose the soloists. I am happy to have a total of 33 groups of young people who participated in these auditions this year, where nine soloists were chosen.
He is the director of the only youth orchestra in Macau. How do you describe the panorama of musical formation of younger people? Where do you need to improve?
Yes of course. I started playing from the Macao orchestra from an early age, I'm a violinist. I can tell you that, at the level of training, most teachers are from Hong Kong or Guangzhou, that every week moving to Macau to train our young people. Macau is well known as the city of the game, but it is also a cultural space. You can feel the heritage that exists in Macau, thanks in part to the previous Portuguese administration, and we have to thank the maintenance of this Portuguese culture and a whole western culture mixed with the eastern. Macau is special for that. I think we have to promote this culture and know how to develop it. In the case of classical music, we started to have an orchestra in 1983, still during the government of the Portuguese administration, and there we also organized a series of competitions for the younger ones. The Macao International Music Festival also began to be organized several decades ago, as well as the Macao Arts Festival. Today, Macau has more initiatives of this genre and this is good for enriching our culture, especially the classical music that is made in the territory.
In addition to the Sunday show, what is on the Macao Youth Orchestra Agenda for this year?
I can tell you that we will participate in this year's edition of the Mafra Music Festival “Filipe de Sousa”, scheduled for July. I will visit Mafra and all the places where we will act, have meetings and organize myself with production. It will not be the first time we are, as a group, in Portugal, but I think that for most young musicians will be the first time. Our orchestra has played twice in Portugal, the first time was in 2010.
Do you understand that the Macao government should give more support for classical music training?
I always think that the government should give more support to classical music studies. For this it is not enough to spend money on the organization of festivals, it takes a greater focus on music education. We also have to teach the population how to appreciate classical music, listening to it and consuming it so that they can know what they hear and go to concerts. Macao is a small territory with about 600,000 inhabitants, and has a lot of money because of the game. We have to use this money to build a Macao culture, which includes classical music. We must create a city that shows its culture, so I always encourage the government to support musical formation. Not just for professional orchestras, but for youth orchestras and music associations.
Macao also lacks higher education courses in the music area, having only the Conservatory. Is this also a gap?
It's right. There are several universities in Macao, but there is, in fact, a lack of formative offer in the area of ​​music. The conservatory does not offer this formation at higher level. At this time, students who want to study music professionally have to leave Macau and go to Europe, the United States of America, Hong Kong or even China. But, on the other hand, the population of Macau is very small and maintaining a conservatory with another type of formative offer would cost a lot of money. I think the best you can do is the government financially supporting these excellent students to be accepted in Macao courses.
The young stars that will take the stage of the Cultural Center of Macau
Organized by the Macao Youth Symphonic Orchestra Association, Sunday's show starts at 7:45 pm and has as its motto “Progressing Towards The Future” [progressing towards the future]. The show will be directed by Italian conductor Lorenzo Antonio Iosco, who is also clarinetist and has been working with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra. Before moving to Asia in 2015, he studied clarinet at the Luigi Cherubini Conservatory in Florence and played in Spain and London.
With regard to the young Macao musicians who take the stage on Sunday, highlighting Zita Ho Nok Chon, born in the territory in 2009, and member of the orchestra since 2021. The young woman attend Pui Ching high school, studies violin and has participated in several contests with distinction. It has played in the orchestra as the first and second violinist.
In the harp stands out Eugenia Wong Hei U, born in 2011 and a student at the Anglican College of Macao. He began playing this instrument with only four years, starting his training at the Conservatory School of Music, which earned his first award when he was only five years old. It currently has classes with Ann Huang, the main harpist at Sinfonietta from Hong Kong.
To HM Eugenia Wong hei u confessed that he feels very pleased by the opportunity provided by the CCM concert. “It has been a great honor to be part of this orchestra, where I met many talented partners and earn a great musical knowledge.”
Another name of Macao on the young orchestra is Brian Mui On Ian, violinist, who also attends Pui Ching Secondary School. In addition to the violin, he began studying piano in 2018. The young man was one of the soloists of last year's edition of the Macao Youth Symphonic Orchestra, the “23rd Macau Music New Generation Musicians Concert 2024”, where he played the composition “Bruch Double Concerto In and Minor”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected people harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | Célio Alves Dias will continue to run this season</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/gp-celio-alves-dias-vai-continuar-a-correr-esta-temporada/</link><description>Macaense pilot Célio Alves Dias was one of the long -term returns of the 2024 car.
 
The Macao Cup winner of Macau in 2021 was removed from motorsport at the time of 2023 for personal reasons, but last year made his debut in the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8). Despite the vast experience in tests of the specialty, having conducted several generations of tourism cars, Célio Alves Dias had never managed the new bobbinns that the Macao-China General Association (AAMC) introduced in its competition in 2023. Last time turned out to be of learning, with some difficulties in the tuning and behavior of the Japanese car.
Participation in races at the Zhuzhou International Circuit and the Macau Grand Prix made Célio Alves Dias realize that his Toyota GR86 was not at the strongest competition level. Based on the conclusions drawn from these experiences, he decided to start preparing for the new season.
“The car had to be all dismantled. My car was bought on Monday, and the chassis and the security arc, for me, were not well done, ”explained Fu Lei Racing Team pilot to HM. “This, made the car too hard and very difficult to bow. I tried a car from China, which was well assembled, and there is a difference. I had a long time in January, in China, with this car. Our cars, made in the same workshop, were very hard, which made it difficult to make turns fast. ”
If in the Macao Grand Prix, the house riders, excellent guide circuit, managed to equate the progress to their hong Kong opponents and the interior of China, in the initial races on the Zhuzhou track in Hunan province, it wasn't quite like that. “There are many differences between cars, but especially in chassis, because engines, in terms of power and horses, are almost all at the same level. Our opponents also experienced many pieces, many engines, even gearboxes, and chassis. Competition cars are always the same. You have to have engine power, but also chassis. Having only power is not enough. Having better a good chassis is the most important. ”
Silver Jubilee in November
Being a usual Portuguese name in the Macao Grand Prix in recent decades, Célio Alves Dias debuted at the Guide Circuit in 2000 and from then was a frequent presence and no faults in the race until 2023. This year, its objective is to account for its twenty-fifth participation in the biggest sports event of RAEM, but will have to align in the findings.
While awaiting the announcement of the 2025 calendar by AAMC, Célio Alves Dias details details to start his test program, because his Toyota, after being reviewed, "is ready to test" in the interior of China, something that will happen "very soon," says the pilot.
In the last edition of the Grand Prix, Célio Alves Dias qualified in 12th place for the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. However, his participation was short and unhappy: at the wheel of Toyota with dorsal No. 11, was forced to give up after being immobilized on the climb of San Francisco. The Macanese pilot was out of the race on the first lap, in an incident that caused the Safety Car.</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:50:53</pubDate></item><item><title>GP TCR | Australia confirms presence in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/19/gp-tcr-australia-confirma-presenca-em-macau/</link><description>The 2025 season of TCR Australia will end largely when joining the TCR World Tour in the race of the 72nd Macao Grand Prix, which will take place from 13 to 16 November
 
After welcoming TCR China by 2024, the FIA ​​TCR World Tour “worldwide” will have the company of the Australian competitors in the most demanding race of the season, as HM had already foreseen at the end of last year.
This announcement is the second news in the calendar of one of the largest national TCR competitions in the world, after the announcement of a new promoter for the championship.
One pilot who was certainly pleased with the news was Australian Ben Bargwanna, who ran on the streets of Macao in 2023. TCR Australia's first international participation was made possible by the global rights holder, the WSC Group, which will ensure full transportation costs for Australian teams traveling to Macau.
"TCR Australia has always been one of TCR's most important and exciting competitions, rooted in the long tradition of tourism motorsport in the country," said WSC Group president Marcello Lotti. The Italian businessman made it clear that “when logistical issues forced us to cancel the Australian rounds of Kumho Fia TCR World Tour last year, we immediately started working to return in 2025. It is fantastic to extend cooperation for a second event and offer Australian competitors the unique opportunity to finish the season in Macau.”
Other applause
TCR Australia Prosecutor David Sonenscher, an old acquaintance of Macao, highlighted the importance of the moment for the category.
"I am very happy to bring TCR Australia to one of the most iconic circuits in the world and certainly one of the biggest challenges for a pilot," said former Malaysian-based English driver and entrepreneur and co-founder of TCR Asia. “The opportunity to expand our cooperation with the TCR World Tour FIA and to show the talented Australian riders on the highest international stage in Macau demonstrates the unique opportunity that TCR Australia and the TCR Global Platform provide all participants.”
Confirmation of the presence of TCR Australia in the Guide Race should not be impeded to the participation of local pilots and the interior of China in the most celebrated tourist car race on the Asian continent.</description><pubDate>2025-02-19 01:54:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Return to GIC | Local tests return to Zhaoqing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/regresso-ao-gic-provas-locais-voltam-a-zhaoqing/</link><description>The dates for the Macao of Tourism Car Championship (MTCs in the English acronym) were made known on the past Friday by the General Automóvel Association of Macau-China (AAMC) through a newsletter. The competition for local pilots and decides to find out the Macao Grand Prix in November will again return to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC).
After a year when the MTCS headed to the Zhuzhou International Circuit in Hunan province, AAMC listened to most of the territory pilots and chose to make these important races closer to the main interveners' house - the pilots. In recent years, the circuit of the surroundings of Zhaoqing has been the preferred stage for the realization of these races, due to the proximity and the fact that it serves as an operational basis to most teams.
The first of the two events scheduled for the 2025 MTCS is scheduled from 18 to 20 April, while the second round is scheduled from May 16 to 18. The AAMC newsletter says that "all riders must go through a selection process before they can participate in the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix - Macau Touring Car Challenge."
Registration, for the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8), are open until March 29 and after the end of the registration period, "all applications will be subject to AAMC approval, which reserves the final right to accept or reject any registration."
The technical regulation was also published, as was officially confirmed the use of tires of the Italian brand Pirelli, which belongs to the Chinese conglomerate Sinochem, as had already happened on the last edition of the Macao Grand Prix.
Confirmation of the Great Bay
AAMC also confirmed the two findings for the GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4), which will be concomitant with the new Chinese Championship Sro GT Cup. The first race will be played from March 21 to 23, at the International Circuit of Shanghai, in the Formula 1 China Grand Prix. Zhuhai International. Also here Pirelli will be the only tire supplier.
These two tests will be determined for the big holiday party on the guide circuit, and it is defined that only 28 cars will be accepted on the starting grid in the mashed race. The 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix runs from November 13 to 16.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:17:32</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | FIA confirms GT World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/gp-macau-fia-confirma-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>The World Council of the FIA ​​last Wednesday confirmed the expected, that the eighth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup will be held as part of the Macao's 72nd Grand Program, from November 13 to 16. However, there is a big news for this year's edition
 
The International Federation, which co-organizes this race in partnership with Sro Motorsports Group and the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), took the opportunity to announce a new qualification model for the race. In addition to the 30 -minute qualification session equal to the previous editions (Q1), a second qualification segment (Q2) was added, reserved for the top ten pilots of the first session.
The Q2 session will be held in Super Pole format, with each pilot to go to the track individually for a total of two qualification turns, and each pilot is also allowed to use a new tire set at this session. This novelty will allow qualification to be decided without interference from third parties.
The remaining program of the Queen of GT will remain the same as the previous editions, with the free training session, the traditional 12-lap classification race on Saturday afternoon, followed by the 16-lap main race that will decide the world's Cup winner on Sunday.
Veterans compliments
These measures introduced by the FIA ​​were very well received by the most experienced GT riders. This is because traffic has always been a huge obstacle in obtaining a good qualification return on the guide circuit, something essential for those who aim to win this title.
"It's an excellent idea to introduce the Super Pole session in Macao," said German Maro Engel, the winner of the World Cup last edition by Mercedes-AMG. This will be one of the most spectacular and exciting sessions of the season and should also secure sports justice. Fans have a lot to yearn. ”
Raffaele Marciello, for two winning occasions of this trophy, and one of BMW's factory riders, also reacted positively, adding: “In Macao, it was always complicated to make a clean turn. With this new format, you will not hear the excuse of traffic or a red flag. Having only two laps will be very challenging, but now the fastest pilot will probably be in pole. ”
This is an opinion shared by Laurens Vanthoor, the World Cup winner in 2016, who said there will no longer be “apologies” in the qualification. Porsche's experienced Belgian pilot believes that “there will be an added pressure because you only have these two turns”, because in a difficult circuit like this, “if you make an error, there is nothing else to follow. In a normal qualification, you have more opportunities. Personally, a shootout is always something I appreciate a lot. For pilots, on a track like this, it will be almost the highlight of the weekend. ”
And the younger ones too
Chinese pilot Yifei Ye premiered at the Grand Prix last November at the World Cup. Ferrari's official pilot, which competes in the Endurance Fia World Championship (WEC), has left a good impression on the guide circuit, and he also welcomes the now introduced measurements.
“It's good to eliminate these red flag interventions and yellow flags, so that in the end, the one that really is the fastest to get pole position,” said Yifei Ye that she could return to the race this year. “In Macau, everyone is very close in terms of times, so it will be extremely difficult for pilots to try to reach Super Pole. I think it will also be great for viewers. ”</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 01:03:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorcycling | FHO RACING WITH NEW FOCUS IN 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/motociclismo-fho-racing-com-novo-foco-em-2025/</link><description>Doubts dissipated this week. Macau's businesswoman Foye Ho's FHO Racing will continue to active in the 2025 season, but without the initially announced riders. Peter Hickman and Davey Todd are leaving and goes to a new team called 8ten Racing
 
According to a statement sent by FHO Racing, BMW Motorrad UK has restructured its training for the 2025 British Superbike Championship, and FHO Racing BMW will compete with a single pilot aboard a BMW M 1000 RR. German 2024 Superbike Champion and Resistance World Cup driver, Ilya Mikhalchik, will make his debut in the British competition, at a time when team owner Faye Ho, realinhas the objectives of his team “to explore new activities in motorized new markets, with the support of BMW Motorrad Motorsport”.
Currently in his fifth year at the British Superbike Championship Paddock, Faye Ho has been a strong presence in the British competition, as well as in the popular road races, such as the Macao Grand Prix, as well as supporting several young female riders, helping them progress in their careers since the lower classes. Faye Ho, Stanley Ho's granddaughter and Clementina Leitão, has supported Kate Walker and Jamie Hanks-Bliott on BMW F 900 R Cup and, it seems, which will continue to support.
To be
Contrary to the rumors that put her from Paddock's departure, Faye Ho made it clear that she is a “great advocate of the British Superbike Championship, one of the world's most exciting and competitive competitions” and will keep her commitment to discipline. However, the territory entrepreneur now has new objectives for herself and its structure. The future will be in Asia and support for young female talents.
"Given my long -term objectives, which include expanding motor sport activities in Asia and continuing to support young women in motorcycling, I realized that I cannot dedicate the same time, to the British Superbike Championship and the road races, which I gave them since I became the owner of the team in 2021, due to additional commitments I have in Macao," Faye Ho said.
Another chapter
This announcement has put an end to a successful partnership, particularly on the island of Man TT, between Peter Hickman, four times winner of the Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, and Fho Racing. Hickman left some words of thanks to his now former boss.
“I want to leave a huge thanks to Faye [Ho] and Fho Racing for all they have done for me over the past four years,” Hickman wrote in a Facebook social network post. “As it is normal in motorized sport, we had amazing moments and others more difficult, but Fho has always been and always will be a fundamental part of my career. I will be eternally grateful for this opportunity. ”
The new 8ten Racing team, which will be officially presented on February 26, will be mostly composed of former FHO Racing elements. Hickman and Todd will maintain the important support of BMW Motorrad UK and are expected on the big prize starting grid in November.</description><pubDate>2025-02-13 01:30:05</pubDate></item><item><title>FHO RACING | Peter Hickman denies closing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/07/fho-racing-peter-hickman-nega-encerramento/</link><description>Peter Hickman, four times winner of the Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, denied the rumors that claimed that the team Racing, from the Macau Faye Ho businesswoman, would have closed the doors and would be absent on the British Superbike Championship (BSB) and the Macao Grand Prix in 2025
 
Peter Hickman goes to the fifth season in the British Championship with Fho Racing, however, before the season's start, some rumors came to circulate in Paddock about the team's future. In recent years, FHO Racing has become one of the top teams in the British Superbike Championship and road events, such as the MAN's island TT or the Macao Grand Prix.
Last November, the team announced that they featured Peter Hickman and Davey Todd, winner of the troubled last edition of the Macao Grand Motor Prize in the British Superbike Championship. Faye Ho said at the time that “for 2025 and also for this year's Macao Grand Prix, we have a very strong team, with Davey joining Pete and Michael aboard the BMW. We have two super talented drivers on the roads for next season, and with Davey jumping to the Superbike class, after winning the Superstock Championship for the second time, I think we'll have a strong season. I can't expect my team to return to Macau, I love to share my hometown with the team and show all points of interest, it's such a special place for me. ”
Although Hickman and Todd have been present at the BMW Motorrad Motorsport season in Berlin in mid -January, since November that Fho Racing has no news, which has generated some discomfort and doubts among fans. Hickman was testing his BMW M1000RR from his Phr Performance in Spain, when he responded with a striking "no" to a fan of a fan on Instagram social network about the rumor of FHO Racing activity ceasing, a "no" that had wide repercussion in the specialized British press.
It's not the first time
After a difficult season of his team in 2024 in the British Superbike Championship, Faye Ho, Stanley Ho's granddaughter, had to face similar rumors last September. In Oulton Park, before the opening race of the 2024 showdown, Faye Ho confirmed to journalists that FHO Racing would continue to participate in the 2025 British Superbike Championship, “which is good news, but anything will be announced in time. But I'm happy to be back here and to stay here, it's a big championship and I love to be in this racing environment. ”
To increase speculation between fans, Hickman suggested on social networks a change of direction this year, leaving an announcement about his plans for the North West 200 and TT of the island of Man. In Spain, the British will have tested with his motorcycle without any reference and FHO Racing spectals, while Todd changed his profile photo on social networks, for a photo with a motorcycle from Milwaukee BMW by Tas Racing.
Sources of the world of motorcycling tell us that the future of FHO Racing is expected to be known in the coming days, but one thing is that Hickman, regardless of the team, has in his sports program to the trip to masters in November, to try to win the fifth victory in the guide circuit.</description><pubDate>2025-02-07 02:20:15</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
