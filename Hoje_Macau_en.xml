The Chinese Coast Guard indicated in a statement published on the WeChat platform that it “took the necessary control measures in accordance with the law”. Spokesman Liu Dejun said the Coast Guard ordered the Japanese vessel Zuiho-maru to move away from the area, reiterating that the archipelago, known as Diaoyu in China, constitutes "China's inherent territory."
Liu also urged Japan to “immediately cease all infringing and provocative activities” in the area and assured that the Coast Guard will continue to carry out “law enforcement operations to defend the rights” of China.
In recent years, Beijing has given its coast guard new capabilities, including the authority to detain foreign vessels suspected of illegally entering territorial waters, amid rising territorial tensions with U.S. allies such as Japan and the Philippines. The Chinese Coast Guard has also substantially strengthened operational capacity, thanks to the allocation of more ships and increased logistical support.
Located in the East China Sea, about 150 kilometers northeast of Taiwan, the uninhabited Diaoyu Islands cover an area of ​​approximately seven square kilometers, and it is believed that there may be important deposits of gas or oil in the adjacent waters.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 08:11:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Housing for exchange | Alert for payment deadline</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/habitacao-para-troca-alerta-para-fim-de-prazo-para-pagar/</link><description>Macau Urban Renewal issued a warning yesterday to applicants for exchange homes in the Pearl Metropolis complex, informing them that they have until January 30th to “complete the purchase procedures, pay the price of the units” and present proof of registration proving the transaction.

However, the HIV virus is still present and it is with this problem in mind that Macau hosts this weekend, at the Grand Lisboa Palace, the 8th Forum on AIDS in Beijing, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, organized by a local association
The Macao AIDS Care Association is promoting, this Saturday and Sunday, the 8th Beijing, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan AIDS Forum, taking place at Lisboeta Macau, in Cotai. This is an event that aims to draw attention to a pathology that evolved into a chronic disease due to the scourge of deaths it caused in the 1980s, but which continues to be present and alert authorities around the world.
According to a statement sent by the association, the aim is to “bring together renowned experts to discuss critical issues of HIV prevention, treatment and social support”. The event aims to cover topics such as “the public health strategy”, namely “the latest developments in policies and technologies related to HIV, including the application of artificial intelligence”, or even “social issues”, such as “important discussions on eliminating stigma and supporting elderly populations living with HIV”.
Other topics on the agenda relate to the “local impact”, namely “Macau’s role as host and collaborator in this important inter-regional dialogue”.
Fight stigma
The conference's theme is “Together wih Love, Not Alone in the Fight” and has the support of entities such as The Home of Red Ribbon, Hong Kong Aids Foundation and Macau Association for Gender Diverse Community, which, as the name suggests, draws attention to gender equality.
The description of the event states that “medical advances have not been accompanied by a proportionate level of understanding and social acceptance”, with “stigma, discrimination and social isolation [which are] deeply rooted” remaining” and which “continue to cause a great psychological impact and lead to systemic marginalization, preventing many people from accessing equitable care and living with dignity”.
There is, therefore, a “critical gap between medical progress and the delay in social support”, which this forum aims to provide answers to. “We focus on two objectives, ‘Eliminating Stigma’ and ‘Building Robust Support Systems’, translating scientific knowledge into tangible and inclusive social practices”, it is described.
One of the speakers comes from Italy, namely from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. Giovanni Guaraldi will speak, on the first day, about “Person-centered approach to HIV care: Why does it matter and how to make it happen?”.
growing
The most recent HIV data in Macau, released in November by the Health Services, speaks of a growing trend: between January and September this year, 28 new cases of HIV infection were registered, 14 of which were among residents and 14 among non-residents.
In comparison, between January and September last year, nine cases had been confirmed among residents, which means that throughout this year there has been a 55.6 percent increase in new cases. In last year's statement, there was no reference to infected non-residents.
“Among the new cases confirmed in Macau residents, all are male, with 50 percent aged between 18 and 39 years old and 50 percent aged 40 or over”, the authorities reported.
Of these cases, 13 of the infections were contracted through homosexual or bisexual intercourse, while one of the cases indicated that it resulted from heterosexual sexual intercourse. “All new cases were referred to the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário for monitoring and, currently, the treatment and control rate for Macau residents exceeds 90 percent”, it was added.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:49:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Housing | Sales and prices with annual drops in November</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/habitacao-vendas-e-precos-com-quebras-anuais-em-novembro/</link><description>In the first half of November, fewer houses were sold and at cheaper prices, compared to the same period in 2024. Transactions fell 18.6 percent, while prices fell 9.1 percent. The usable area of ​​properties sold also decreased by more than 10 percent annually.
The residential property market continued to fall in the first half of November. According to data released yesterday by the Financial Services Directorate, in the first half of November, 118 housing units were sold in the territory, 27 fewer compared to the same period last year, or a reduction of 18.6 percent.
Statistical data based on stamp duty for the transfer of goods also reveals that the average price per square meter followed a downward trend, with a drop of 9.1 percent, to 66,315 patacas. Even the usable area of ​​sold homes decreased by 10.1 percent to 71 square meters
In the period under review, the biggest drops in sales and prices occurred in Taipa, with a total of 21 houses sold, 15 fewer compared to the first half of November 2024, representing a drop of 41.7 percent. Residential property prices in Taipa also fell by 10.2 percent, reaching an average of MOP64,510 per square meter.
On the peninsula, where 90 of the total 118 units were sold, transactions recorded a decrease of 11.8 percent. The price also decreased from 72,613 patacas per square meter to 66,476 patacas per square meter, that is, 8.4 percent less. In the most expensive market (Coloane) seven properties were sold in the first half of November, the same number in annual terms. However, the price per square meter fell 10 percent to 75,946 patacas.
Closer in time
In monthly terms, property values ​​follow the same trend, despite the greater number of sales driven by the peninsula market.
In total, house sales increased in the first half of November, compared to the same period in October, by 3.5 percent, going from 114 transactions to 118, with the market “heating up” slightly on the peninsula with an increase of 9.7 percent. This is not surprising, given that the peninsula was the area of ​​Macau where prices fell the most in monthly terms: 13.4 percent.
In Taipa, sales were maintained (11) and prices rose 5.5 percent, but in Coloane the monthly drop in sales was more severe (-36.4 percent), despite the drop in square meter prices of 11.3 percent. Taking the entire territory of Macau into account, prices suffered a negative monthly variation of 9.9 percent, falling from 73,632 patacas to 66,315 patacas per square meter.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:45:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Scams | Request for AI and more international cooperation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/burlas-pedido-recurso-a-ia-e-mais-cooperacao-internacional/</link><description>Chan Lai Kei, deputy linked to the Fujian Community, wants artificial intelligence to be able to access links received by mobile phone users via SMS, in order to alert them to fraudulent links
Deputy Chan Lai Kei calls on the Government to use the most advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, to identify and prevent online scams. The matter was addressed through a written question from the legislator linked to the Fujian community.
According to Chan, “technological advances” mean that “fraudulent schemes continue to proliferate”, despite the police in Macau having “persistently updated their anti-fraud mechanisms”.
According to data from the Judiciary Police (PJ) cited by the deputy, between November 7th and midday on November 14th, authorities received complaints about 280 fraud attempts in which criminals pretended to be different customer support services and also complaints about 28 attempts in which fraudsters pretended to be police officers, Public Prosecutor's Office agents or Interior Courts.
Complaints were received through applications made available by the authorities. “This indicates that specific types of fraud continue to be prevalent”, says the deputy. “Although these reports have not resulted in real losses, the number of cases indicates that anti-fraud advertising and technical interception measures need to be improved”, he highlights.
Get to work
In this scenario, Chan wants to know if the authorities will create a system using artificial intelligence, so that citizens can receive “instant alerts” when they receive SMS messages considered “high risk”. The legislator therefore advocates that authorities implement a system capable of detecting the content of SMS received by all citizens.
The defense of the measure is justified by what the deputy considers “the recent increase in fake customer service SMS scams”, which in his opinion “indicates the need to further improve the application's proactive alert features”.
As part of its defense of the measure, Chan Lai Kei points out that the “Anti-Fraud Program”, which residents can install on the Wechat platform, has blocked more than 9,000 high-risk operations since its launch in April 2024. At the same time, the deputy is concerned about fraud committed in other countries, such as Myanmar, where large fraud centers operate, often linked to mafias in mainland China.
Without mentioning the countries most involved, Chan warns that part of the phenomenon is outside Macau and therefore requires greater international cooperation, despite recognizing the cooperation developed with Hong Kong and Singapore. The deputy supported by the Fujian community therefore wants to know how the authorities will detect the place of origin of the crimes and reinforce international cooperation.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:42:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Fires | Nick Lei defends strengthening security measures</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/incendios-nick-lei-defende-reforco-das-medidas-de-seguranca/</link><description>Following the fire in Tai Po, Hong Kong, and inspections carried out by Macau authorities, Nick Lei asked what measures will be adopted to ensure safety, especially on construction sites
Deputy Nick Lei hopes that the Government will remain alert to fire safety needs, and ensure effective supervision on construction sites. The matter was addressed by the deputy linked to the Fujian community, through a written interpellation.
The position is taken following the fire in the residential complex in Tai Po, Hong Kong, which resulted in 156 deaths, according to the most recent count, at a time when victims of two residential towers still remain to be counted. The preliminary causes of the fire were related to the materials installed in the renovation work of the residential complex.
Now, Nick Lei has come to recall that after the fire the authorities inspected 60 construction sites with scaffolding, so he wants to know what will be done to correct flaws that have been identified. “In response to the flaws discovered during inspections, how is a permanent review mechanism established to ensure that construction materials meet fire safety standards (…) with a view to effectively raising the level of fire safety on construction sites?”, asks the deputy. Lei also wants to know how to “completely resolve the issue of installing obstacles in corridors” used as emergency exits.
More specific plans
Furthermore, the deputy linked to the Fujian community argues that current relief plans must be more specific to respond to the needs of population density, types of local construction and environmental characteristics of the different areas of the territory.
Nick Lei also wants the Government to clarify emergency response procedures, to guarantee the safety of the population when there are major catastrophes. Lei also points out that Macau can obtain support from neighboring areas in a timely manner, if it has plans to do so.
As for advanced emergency response equipment, Nick Lei wants to know what high-tech means will be imported to assist in rescue work, with the aim of improving firefighting capacity in specific environments, such as tall and older buildings.
“The Government must reinforce safety inspection in public spaces and places, particularly with regard to the preparation of fire-fighting plans in low-rise buildings in community neighborhoods and buildings that do not have an administration entity or condominiums”, he advised. Nick Lei argued that in this way “the efficiency of evacuating buildings in an emergency situation can be increased”, reads the written interpellation.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:35:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Five Year Plan | Economist highlights focus on solving internal problems</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/plano-quinquenal-economista-destaca-foco-na-resolucao-de-problemas-internos/</link><description>Economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu understands that the Central Government's 15th Five-Year Plan aims to consolidate regional economic aspects and resolve “aspects of the Chinese economy that are still problematic”, such as “weak domestic demand”. The position was taken at a seminar promoted by the Chinese Embassy in Lisbon
What are the objectives proposed in China's 15th Five-Year Plan, whose public consultation ended on November 14th? For economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, former Macau resident and president of the Friends of the New Silk Road Association (ANRS), the plan could respond to “some aspects of the Chinese economy that are still problematic, such as weak domestic demand”.
The position was taken at a seminar, held recently in Lisbon and promoted by the Chinese Embassy in Portugal, entitled “Interpretation of the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of China. Perspectives for Future China-Portugal Cooperation”. Maria Fernanda Ilhéu's speech, consulted by HM, was published by her on social media.
For Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, “despite government stimuli, domestic consumption remains low in its contribution to GDP [Gross Domestic Product]”, and “some bottlenecks and obstacles are impeding economic flows, such as the delay in agricultural and rural modernization and the pressure on employment”.
At this point, the economist highlighted the “graduates who do not find jobs that match their qualifications”, in addition to the fact that the country still hopes to achieve “per capita income growth, which is intended to be more accelerated and balanced in regions that are still very poor”. In turn, there are still “some difficulties in public services and social support”, while “the aging of the population presents challenges to economic development and the provision of services for the well-being of the population over 65 years of age”.
Maria Fernanda Ilhéu cited data on this aspect, relating to 2024, when the elderly represented 14.1 percent of the population, 4.7 percent more compared to 2014.
Based on the document presented by Beijing, the economist said that the 15th Five-Year Plan also intends to “project the Chinese economy towards self-sustainability and global competition”, and, in her view, the country faces “three challenges”.
They are the “great volubility” which is described by Chinese authorities as “strategic opportunities that exist alongside risks and challenges, while uncertainties and unpredictable factors are growing”.
A changing model
Maria Fernanda Ilhéu also highlights that “China's growth model is changing, with population changes, corrections in the real estate sector and decreasing returns on investment in infrastructure, requiring new factors to maintain the pace of growth”. Furthermore, “technology has become fundamental on the stage of global competition”, something that “requires and pressures China towards self-reliant innovation and industrial resilience”.
The economist does not forget the regional issues, which Macau is included in, particularly regarding the “objective for some cities and super regions” and the “dynamizing role of the Yangtze River Delta and the Guangdong-Hong Kong – Macau Greater Bay Area”.
In this context, the aim is to “achieve progress in industrialization, computerization, urbanization and agricultural modernization through new forms of production, and fostering new patterns of development”. The idea is that there will be a “modernization of the industry”, in which the “frontline sectors” will be “artificial intelligence (AI), advanced robotics, quantum computing, semiconductors, biotechnologies and new generation of information and aerospace technology”.
For Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, these areas are “foundational in a strategy of international competitiveness, resilience and growth multiplier effects”.
The importance of Lusophony
The economist also defended that the lines drawn up in the 15th Five-Year Plan point to the promotion of the Yangtze River Delta, including the province of Zhejiang, “homeland of the majority of overseas Chinese who chose Portugal to live and work”, or even, in the Greater Bay Area, which includes Macau, “one of the central vertices, where the centuries-old Portuguese presence is a strategic asset in cooperation between Portugal and China”.
For her, the “priority areas of cooperation” should focus on green energy, namely battery production, green hydrogen and mobility, “sectors where China leads”. Digitalization and AI, particularly in the construction of “digital health” and “smart cities” tools, in terms of logistics and ports. Other strategic points are infrastructure, health, biotechnology and cooperation in scientific research and industrial production in AI, he pointed out.
Bet on consumption
According to an analysis by the China Briefing portal, linked to the consultancy Dezan Shira &amp; Associates, China is currently in “very different conditions” compared to the last Five-Year Plan. Today the worst phase and consequent impacts of Covid-19 appear to have passed, however, there is “pressure on domestic industries” that will continue “to shape economic policy in the coming years”. Furthermore, the fact that Donald Trump is once again in the White House is highlighted, referring to the United States as “the largest individual trading partner and main economic rival”.
In this way, the Five-Year Plan designed for the years 2026 to 2030 “will be drawn up with these issues in mind”, and “priorities will probably focus on improving economic resilience, including the diversification of trading partners and reducing dependence on imports” of products and materials considered “critical”.
It is also intended to “stimulate domestic consumption and improve internal capabilities in key technologies”.
The same analysis reflects a speech given by President Xi Jinping, in April this year, in which he points out that the 15th Five-Year Plan must “practically evaluate how changes in the international scenario affect China”, and an adjustment must be made, “optimizing the country's economic structure”.
Regarding the promotion of domestic consumption, highlight is the announcement, on November 26th, of an action plan presented by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, which aims, according to the state agency Xinhua, “the formation of multimillion-dollar consumer sectors in the coming years”.
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) seems to be the norm, such as smart refrigerators “that can recommend a shopping list and glasses that can respond to various user commands”.
Xinhua writes about the aforementioned plan that “China intends to form three massive consumption sectors, namely elderly care products, smart connected vehicles and consumer electronics, with a market scale that will reach trillions of yuan by 2027”. In addition, “ten categories of high-demand consumer goods worth 100 billion yuan (about 14 billion US dollars) will be promoted, including products for children and babies, smart wearable devices, cosmetics, fitness equipment, and food and pet products.”
Double news
The fourth plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, held in October, adopted recommendations for the Five-Year Plan, which focused on maintaining the “domestic demand expansion strategy” with efforts “to ensure that new demand drives new supply”, also promoting “positive interactions between consumption and investment and between supply and demand”.
Not even on purpose, the China Briefing portal adds that the 15th Five-Year Plan “should dedicate significant space to the development of the ‘AI Plus’ initiative and supporting sectors, with policies aimed at promoting investment, fiscal support, talent training and public-private collaborations”.
The 15th Five-Year Plan should also “define carbon emission targets and realign the decarbonization strategy”, and the country “is changing the main decarbonization strategy”, moving “from the focus on reducing total energy consumption to concentrating on reducing total carbon emissions”.
It is worth highlighting the fact that the final version of the 15th Five-Year Plan will only be presented during the so-called Two Sessions of March next year, of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, when it will be adopted and implemented by the authorities in Beijing.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:32:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese coast guard expels Japanese boat from Tokyo-controlled islands</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/guarda-costeira-chinesa-expulsa-barco-japones-de-ilhas-controladas-por-toquio/</link><description>China's coast guard yesterday expelled a Japanese fishing vessel that, according to Chinese authorities, had illegally entered waters near the Diaoyu islands, controlled by Japan but disputed by other countries.

Curatorial notes
To organize this exhibition and its content, the curators based themselves on “the experience of two legendary travelers from the 16th century, one from the West and the other from the East: the Portuguese Fernão Mendes Pinto and the Chinese Xu Xiake”, both of whom, according to the IC, “measured the world with their own steps, transforming their observations and travel experiences into philosophical reflections on life”.
The exhibition “uses artistic creation in place of physical travel, offering visitors a visual feast through 28 pieces/sets of works in various media”. The possible visitor experience is described, which could be similar to “following in the footsteps of a traveler, starting an artistic tour of self-reflection and exploration of the world”.

According to a survey released on Monday by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, 36 percent of companies are considering developing supply capacity outside China and 32 percent plan to obtain inputs from other markets, while 43 percent have not yet made a strategic decision.
The survey, carried out between 6 and 24 November with responses from 131 companies, reveals that the majority have already been affected or expect to be affected by Chinese measures, which cover rare earth minerals, lithium battery technologies, super-hard materials and extraterritorial controls on products that incorporate components processed in China.
According to the report, the most immediate impact is on delivery times: 40 percent of respondents indicated that approval procedures added more than two months to supply times, while another 34 percent reported delays of between one and two months. The difficulties center on the process of applying for an export license with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.
Nearly 40 percent complained about a lack of transparency, 21 percent found the requirements unclear, and 40 percent said requests exceeded the official 45-day processing limit set by authorities. Some companies have expressed concern about the amount of sensitive information they must provide, including intellectual property.
Other complications
The problems don't end after the license is granted: 42 percent reported additional customs delays and 26 percent said the obstacles added a week or more to the shipment of previously authorized goods. Supply disruptions are affecting both exporters with factories in China and European producers who depend on Chinese parts or equipment.
The document states that 60 percent foresee “moderate or significant” interruptions if all announced controls are fully implemented, and 13 percent fear total production interruptions. Chamber President Jens Eskelund warns that Chinese authorities have “added uncertainty” to the operations of European companies, coinciding with a period of trade friction between Beijing and Brussels.
The institution's vice-president, Stefan Bernhart, recommended the establishment of a “general licensing system” in the short term, which would provide “much-needed stability and predictability”. In April, Beijing imposed restrictions on several categories of rare earth elements and derivatives, which led some European companies to temporarily halt their production lines.
Despite the partial suspension of certain measures following the November summit between China and the United States, part of the control regime remains active and continues to affect supply chains.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 08:05:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Satellite Casinos | Kam Pek closed its doors</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/casinos-satelite-kam-pek-fechou-as-portas/</link><description>The Kam Pek Paradise casino, linked to the concessionaire SJM Resorts, closed its doors at 11:31 pm on Monday.

“After the closure of the Casino Kam Pek Paradise, at 11:59 pm on December 1st, the DICJ immediately suspended the operation of the tables and gaming machines, having ensured active coordination with various services, to monitor the removal of the respective premises, among other work”, was communicated by the authorities. “During the closure of the aforementioned casino, the Directorate of Labor Affairs Services sent staff to the site to provide clarifications to the workers in question, and they were provided with information on an open line for further consultation”, it was added.
The number of workers affected by layoffs was not communicated by the DICJ, which also did not make reference to the number of workers who will be transferred to SJM Resorts.
In July this year, when it was confirmed that the Kam Pek Paradise casino was going to close, the news caused surprise among analysts. A statement from CLSA that month indicated that the closure was unexpected, given that the casino was run at a profit.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:48:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Paulo Maia and Carmo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Cui Zizhong (1574-1644), the painter from Laiyang (Shandong), who lived in Beijing near the end of the Ming dynasty, was, in the North, a notable figure in the resurgence of figure painting that in the South, with Chen Hongshou (1599-1652), led this resurgence with strange representations of human figures and their environments.
Adjectives such as «bizarre», «eccentric», «peculiar» but also «archaic» were attributed to his paintings. The latter, however, already points to a common desire among literate painters: if they were anachronistic they continued to correspond to the desire to make painting a vehicle to convey elevated feelings and fluid thoughts.
Cui Zizhong's figures sometimes seemed to express this effort. Looking at their disheveled clothes, some noticed how they looked like people who had just returned from sleepless nights of long conversations that didn't even allow time to rest. Other painters, in their works, followed these extravagant visions, proving that figurative meetings perhaps corresponded to authentic dialogues.
Such would be the case of a literary friend of Cui Zizhong who after the age of sixty dedicated himself solely to painting at court, at the Imperial Academy of Painting in Beijing, restored in the Ming dynasty, called Wang Chongjie (1605-1667). For the portrait that Wang Chongjie made in the summer of 1657 of the Suzhou painter, Wang Jian (1598-1677), which is in the Kaikodo Art Gallery, in Hawaii (horizontal scroll, ink and color on silk, 43.3 x174 cm), other important authors who participated in these dialogues contributed: Wang Wu (1632-90), according to a colophone, created the landscape around the subject, with a river where two ducks swim, and next to the painting, the celebrated painter Wu Weiye (1609-71), who lived through the dynastic transition with sorrow, wrote a poem.
Wang Chongjie, in making Wang Jian's portrait, would seem to be making a synthesis of the state of art in his time. Not only was he the grandson of the famous and venerated painter Wang Shizhen (1526-90), but the careful treatment of the shadows on his face may indicate the appropriation of a new way of doing things resulting from contact with European painters who were at the court at the end of the Ming.
In an album that shows literati next to watercourses (paint and color on silk, 25.5 x 31.3 cm, at the Angewandte kunst Museum in Frankfurt), when there are mountains they are only schematic. If, as Confucius said, mountains please the heart and flowing waters please thoughts, one can deduce that it was this flowing water that inspired them. And what were these dialogues about in the midst of pristine nature, Zhang Yanyuan in the 19th century. IX, writing about the edifying character of painting, said: «it is a means through which events are preserved, in such a way that they serve as models (for the virtuous) and warnings (for the wrong path)».</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Ana Cristina Alves</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>By Ana Cristina Alves, Assistant Researcher and Coordinator of the Educational Service of the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center1
The early Taoist philosophy, that of Laozi and the Book of Way and Virtue (《道德经/經》), will choose the water of the ocean and the sea as the privileged image of the Tao (道 Dào), that which cannot be said, without form, on which the universe itself and the ten thousand beings (万物 wânwù) that inhabit it depend, as well as the first principles of existence, the void (無/无 wú), the masculine yang (陽/阳 yáng) and the feminine yin (阴/隂yīn).
This choice of an indigenous Chinese philosophy finds its echo in popular language and philosophy, for example in expressions such as “enormous capacity” (海量Hǎiliàng), which can have both an affective and social interpretation of portentous generosity or magnanimity, as well as a physical and concrete one, applying to someone who can ingest large quantities of alcohol. The sea is also linked to the word good and constant, for example in the “oath of eternal love as energetic as the sea and firm as the mountain”, where mountain lends added firmness to the promise (海誓山盟 or 山盟海誓Hǎishì-Shānméng or Shānméng-Hǎishì).
The ocean, the sea, but also the great rivers are made up of generous water, both in popular and erudite Taoist philosophy.  Here water is the figurative model of the Tao, as read in the Book of Way and Virtue and in the best sinology, which is why we recommend additional reading of Alan Watts Tao: The Watercourse Way.
It is worth paying special attention to the chapters in which water appears as the closest representation of the Tao in the Book of Way and Virtue, namely: chapters 8, 14, 34, 66 and 78.
In chapter 8 we are informed that the Tao is the supreme good “like water” (上善如水) (Abreu, 2014, 43), but it is not water itself. Therefore, it will be due to the similarity of functions that both are compared. Now water is generous, granting life to all beings, without establishing any distinction between them, its gift reaches even those that no one likes and I am thinking, for example, of parasites. It remains close to the earth to fertilize it, it is deep, simple, true, fair and correct and very timely, when it washes and cleans at the right time.
So is the Tao.  In the first verses of chapter XIV, regarding the Tao, an aquatic image appears again:
 
You look and you don't see,
It's called Indistinct.
You listen and you don't hear,
It's called Silent.
Touch and don't get caught,
It's called Subtle.
This trio is not decipherable
For it merges into a unity
2 (Ribeiro, 2004, 32-33)
And a little later we are told that he is nameless and uninterrupted (繩繩不可名) (Ibidem)
The Tao is like an ocean, an uninterrupted and inexhaustible unity in which someone easily imagines themselves swimming in water that is neither too bright nor too dark, as would happen to Michael Saso in his 14th meditation on the Tao, in A Taoist Cookbook. with Meditations from the Laozi DaodeJing, which he called “Nadar no Tao” (Saso, 1994,47), a meditation that he accompanied by a recipe for spinach, soy paste and sesame, since the wise man is the one who “empties the mind and fills the belly” (虛其心實其復) (Ribeiro, 2004, 10-11), here one feels how the author is immersed in the great Tao, following with the current.
Water can also be represented in a large river, as in chapter 34:
The great Tao floods like a river,
To the left, to the right,
Ten thousand beings depend on him.
（大道泛兮/其可左右/万物恃之而生）
(Abreu, 2013, 94-95)
In the same chapter we are told that the Tao not only gives life but nourishes and feeds, being an essential shelter in the return to the origins, not for death, but for eternal life diluted in the great unity, being therefore great, as big as the sea, or rather the great sea, which is the ocean.
Whoever wants to be as it should be in existence or even correctly govern the world, must follow the model of the water in rivers and seas, as we read in chapter 66:
Rivers and seas are greater than a hundred valleys
Because they remain below them,
and so they are princes, dominating waterfalls and streams.
(江海所以能为百谷王者/以其善下之/故能为百故王)3
(Abreu,2013, 158-159)
The wise man's behavior is distinguished by its malleability and spontaneity. He does not impose himself, which is why he is respected by everyone, only he should then govern, because he acts naturally, without oppressing, without hurting, letting everyone follow their course as freely as possible, as is reiterated in chapter 78:
Nothing in the world is more malleable and flexible
as for water,
but in attacking what is hard and rigid
nothing can surpass it
and there is nothing to replace it.
(天下莫柔弱於水/而攻堅強者莫之能先)
(Ribeiro, 2004 160-161)
Laozi's Taoist water is among the Five Chinese Elements (Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal) the one that evokes great oceanic unity, source of life for everything that exists, but also of death, or rather, of return to origins and eternal life, when this image represents the philosophical principle Tao. And if water, fresh and salty, is the supreme good of the world, the Tao is the origin, the supreme good, including of Heaven. As a root or mysterious female (chap 6) it is the root of the cosmos as we know and experience it. He is a source of spiritual and material life, but so is water, since his model must be followed in all circumstances, from the material source of beings to complex human conduct. People who act correctly, and especially Taoist sages and saints, are aware of the physical and concrete model of water that helps them practice another invisible one, that of Tao.  They will then be malleable and adaptable, capable of nourishing themselves from the inside and giving life to any form on the outside. You will know how to transform yourself to better nourish and vivify.
The Taoist oceanic model differs from the one that inspired the Portuguese throughout history, who looked to the sea as their ocean. Taoist water is not challenging nor does it call for conquest, it does not have cables of storm or hope to bend, it does not require weapons or boats, nor maps, nor nautical instruments. It is the dominant, conquering element within all beings, who will adapt to this most malleable element, without needing to develop their inventive spirit. The philosophy it leads to does not ask for vigilance or a critical spirit, but adaptation to the world as it is and generosity to accept it with a minimum of suffering and a maximum of joy.

Four years ago, in 2021, James inherited more than 300 pieces of antiques from his elderly father. The family heritage dates back to the Song dynasty (10th-13th centuries) and the collection includes exquisite jade items, porcelain, bronze wares, incense burners and high-value jewelry from various periods. During the turbulent war years, these treasures were buried in a hole in the backyard for decades. Now, through their interdisciplinary curatorial project, they are about to enter a dynamic dialogue with the worlds of fashion, art and sport.
Joy: How did you feel when you received the family inheritance?
I was completely surprised! My brothers and I had no idea that our family had such things. We were ignorant about our family history.
Joy: Tell me about your family history.
James: Our original surname was Zhao and we belonged to the imperial family of the Song dynasty. Our roots are in the heart of Chinese civilization. Chinese history has been complicated and turbulent, and my family has failed to preserve the details of our specific ups and downs. All I know is that in 1931, to escape the Japanese occupation, my grandmother took my father and other family members and together they walked to Chongqing in the south. My father was still a boy. To survive and take better care of her son and family, my grandmother decided to remarry into a local clan called the Xing. The Xing family accepted the proposal, as long as my grandmother paid them 300 taels of silver, a significant amount in wartime China. That's how we changed our imperial surname Zhao to Xing. After remarrying, my grandmother asked my father to dig a hole in the yard. That's where the family heirloom was stored, until my father decided to pass it on to me. My father didn't want to divide the collection between my brothers, as he knew I was the only one who could appreciate its true value. To repay my father's appreciation for me, I immediately gave my private collection a name: Jade Ambience, 琼华幸境 in Chinese.
Joy: Why that name?
James: I feel like I've always been lucky in life, like I've always been protected by some supernatural force with which I could cure strange illnesses and save people. You know, I love helping people and I can't stand seeing sadness and injustice in the world. Since he was a child, he saved lives during the annual floods of the Yangtze River in Chongqing. I didn't fear for my own life, because I knew I was protected. Will it be a gift? I would like to believe so. I even abandoned my career as a successful businessman and decided I wanted to be a soldier, so I could actually contribute to my country instead of earning a lot of money. I even turned down an opportunity to go to the USA and run a company there. That was in 1989. My experiences in the army made me stronger, both physically and mentally. I value life's experiences because they make me understand the human world better and give me positive energy to appreciate each day. In some inexplicable way, I attribute all of this to the jade items in my collection (laughs).
JOy: In fact, Chinese people believe that jade stone radiates positive energy. Since ancient times, jade has been associated with protective power, healing power and immortality. What is the true value of your collection, in your opinion?
As I said, jade has a very special place in Chinese culture. Jade symbolizes moral integrity and virtue, which is the stone's central symbolic value.
Confucianism inextricably linked jade to the ideal of the “exemplary person” (junzi 君子), who should embody the virtues reflected in the physical qualities of jade, including benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, courage (“It is better to be a broken jade than an intact tile”) and purity.
Jade served as a material expression of authority and was made into ritual objects used to communicate with divine forces and symbolized imperial power—most notably through the legendary Imperial Seal made of jade. For ordinary Chinese people, jade offers protection and good luck and has long been considered a talisman against evil forces. Jade carvings also carry auspicious meanings: bats for blessings, peaches for longevity, and fish for abundance. In ancient belief systems, jade was believed to preserve the body and soul after death. This concept found its ultimate expression in the jade burial suits of the Han dynasty, intricately assembled from thousands of pieces of jade to ensure immortality. Jade was also seen as the essence of the cosmos—a fusion of the vital energies of heaven and earth. The Chinese language is rich in jade-related expressions that convey admiration and virtue! Therefore, jade items are timeless symbols of love, symbolizing lasting and sincere affection. Today, jade remains a precious heirloom, a solid investment, and a powerful emblem of cultural identity — connecting contemporary Chinese to our heritage. In this way, jade contains old and new life! Jade is not just a precious stone full of vitality. It is a cultural landmark — a bridge between old China and new China.
Joy: What do you want to do with your collection?
James: Right now, I'm planning to organize a traveling exhibition in Beijing, Shanghai and maybe Macau. As I said before, jade is full of vitality. Jade is a bridge between ancient China and modern China. So I don't want to limit my collection to the usual antique circles. I'm thinking about doing cross exhibitions with fashion, art and sport. I want jade to have a lively dialogue with contemporary, young and modern Chinese audiences!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Paulo Maia and Carmo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Cui Zizhong (1574-1644), the painter from Laiyang (Shandong), who lived in Beijing near the end of the Ming dynasty, was, in the North, a notable figure in the resurgence of figure painting that in the South, with Chen Hongshou (1599-1652), led this resurgence with strange representations of human figures and their environments.

The position was taken at a seminar promoted by the Chinese Embassy in Lisbon
What are the objectives proposed in China's 15th Five-Year Plan, whose public consultation ended on November 14th? For economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, former Macau resident and president of the Friends of the New Silk Road Association (ANRS), the plan could respond to “some aspects of the Chinese economy that are still problematic, such as weak domestic demand”.
The position was taken at a seminar, held recently in Lisbon and promoted by the Chinese Embassy in Portugal, entitled “Interpretation of the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of China. Perspectives for Future China-Portugal Cooperation”. Maria Fernanda Ilhéu's speech, consulted by HM, was published by her on social media.
For Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, “despite government stimuli, domestic consumption remains low in its contribution to GDP [Gross Domestic Product]”, and “some bottlenecks and obstacles are impeding economic flows, such as the delay in agricultural and rural modernization and the pressure on employment”.
At this point, the economist highlighted the “graduates who do not find jobs that match their qualifications”, in addition to the fact that the country still hopes to achieve “per capita income growth, which is intended to be more accelerated and balanced in regions that are still very poor”. In turn, there are still “some difficulties in public services and social support”, while “the aging of the population presents challenges to economic development and the provision of services for the well-being of the population over 65 years of age”.
Maria Fernanda Ilhéu cited data on this aspect, relating to 2024, when the elderly represented 14.1 percent of the population, 4.7 percent more compared to 2014.
Based on the document presented by Beijing, the economist said that the 15th Five-Year Plan also intends to “project the Chinese economy towards self-sustainability and global competition”, and, in her view, the country faces “three challenges”.
They are the “great volubility” which is described by Chinese authorities as “strategic opportunities that exist alongside risks and challenges, while uncertainties and unpredictable factors are growing”.
A changing model
Maria Fernanda Ilhéu also highlights that “China's growth model is changing, with population changes, corrections in the real estate sector and decreasing returns on investment in infrastructure, requiring new factors to maintain the pace of growth”. Furthermore, “technology has become fundamental on the stage of global competition”, something that “requires and pressures China towards self-reliant innovation and industrial resilience”.
The economist does not forget the regional issues, which Macau is included in, particularly regarding the “objective for some cities and super regions” and the “dynamizing role of the Yangtze River Delta and the Guangdong-Hong Kong – Macau Greater Bay Area”.
In this context, the aim is to “achieve progress in industrialization, computerization, urbanization and agricultural modernization through new forms of production, and fostering new patterns of development”. The idea is that there will be a “modernization of the industry”, in which the “frontline sectors” will be “artificial intelligence (AI), advanced robotics, quantum computing, semiconductors, biotechnologies and new generation of information and aerospace technology”.
For Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, these areas are “foundational in a strategy of international competitiveness, resilience and growth multiplier effects”.
The importance of Lusophony
The economist also defended that the lines drawn up in the 15th Five-Year Plan point to the promotion of the Yangtze River Delta, including the province of Zhejiang, “homeland of the majority of overseas Chinese who chose Portugal to live and work”, or even, in the Greater Bay Area, which includes Macau, “one of the central vertices, where the centuries-old Portuguese presence is a strategic asset in cooperation between Portugal and China”.
For her, the “priority areas of cooperation” should focus on green energy, namely battery production, green hydrogen and mobility, “sectors where China leads”. Digitalization and AI, particularly in the construction of “digital health” and “smart cities” tools, in terms of logistics and ports. Other strategic points are infrastructure, health, biotechnology and cooperation in scientific research and industrial production in AI, he pointed out.
Bet on consumption
According to an analysis by the China Briefing portal, linked to the consultancy Dezan Shira &amp; Associates, China is currently in “very different conditions” compared to the last Five-Year Plan. Today the worst phase and consequent impacts of Covid-19 appear to have passed, however, there is “pressure on domestic industries” that will continue “to shape economic policy in the coming years”. Furthermore, the fact that Donald Trump is once again in the White House is highlighted, referring to the United States as “the largest individual trading partner and main economic rival”.
In this way, the Five-Year Plan designed for the years 2026 to 2030 “will be drawn up with these issues in mind”, and “priorities will probably focus on improving economic resilience, including the diversification of trading partners and reducing dependence on imports” of products and materials considered “critical”.
It is also intended to “stimulate domestic consumption and improve internal capabilities in key technologies”.
The same analysis reflects a speech given by President Xi Jinping, in April this year, in which he points out that the 15th Five-Year Plan must “practically evaluate how changes in the international scenario affect China”, and an adjustment must be made, “optimizing the country's economic structure”.
Regarding the promotion of domestic consumption, highlight is the announcement, on November 26th, of an action plan presented by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, which aims, according to the state agency Xinhua, “the formation of multimillion-dollar consumer sectors in the coming years”.
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) seems to be the norm, such as smart refrigerators “that can recommend a shopping list and glasses that can respond to various user commands”.
Xinhua writes about the aforementioned plan that “China intends to form three massive consumption sectors, namely elderly care products, smart connected vehicles and consumer electronics, with a market scale that will reach trillions of yuan by 2027”. In addition, “ten categories of high-demand consumer goods worth 100 billion yuan (about 14 billion US dollars) will be promoted, including products for children and babies, smart wearable devices, cosmetics, fitness equipment, and food and pet products.”
Double news
The fourth plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, held in October, adopted recommendations for the Five-Year Plan, which focused on maintaining the “domestic demand expansion strategy” with efforts “to ensure that new demand drives new supply”, also promoting “positive interactions between consumption and investment and between supply and demand”.
Not even on purpose, the China Briefing portal adds that the 15th Five-Year Plan “should dedicate significant space to the development of the ‘AI Plus’ initiative and supporting sectors, with policies aimed at promoting investment, fiscal support, talent training and public-private collaborations”.
The 15th Five-Year Plan should also “define carbon emission targets and realign the decarbonization strategy”, and the country “is changing the main decarbonization strategy”, moving “from the focus on reducing total energy consumption to concentrating on reducing total carbon emissions”.
It is worth highlighting the fact that the final version of the 15th Five-Year Plan will only be presented during the so-called Two Sessions of March next year, of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, when it will be adopted and implemented by the authorities in Beijing.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:32:46</pubDate></item><item><title>What is known about the fire that killed 151 people in Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/29/o-que-se-sabe-sobre-o-incendio-que-matou-128-pessoas-em-hong-kong/</link><description>Hong Kong continued today to count the victims of the fire that devastated a residential complex on Wednesday, the most serious in decades, with at least 151 dead. Authorities in the neighboring Chinese special administrative region of Macau detained 11 people on suspicion of negligence, but the cause of the fire has not yet been determined.
Here is what is known about the tragedy, according to the news agency France-Presse (AFP):
What happened?
The fire alarm was raised at 2:50 pm on Wednesday. The fire hit a real estate complex with 1,984 homes and eight towers of 31 floors each, called Wang Fuk Court, located in Tai Po, in the New Territories, in the north of Hong Kong. The complex, opened in 1983, was undergoing renovation work, but continued to be occupied by around four thousand people who lived there.
Immense flames spread extremely quickly between the buildings, which were surrounded by bamboo scaffolding and protective nets. Hundreds of firefighters were mobilized to provide assistance and extinguish the fire. Firefighters only declared the end of operations against the fire this morning (Friday).
How many victims?
The most recent provisional balance this afternoon was 128 dead [151 is the most recent number], of which 89 had not yet been identified, according to Hong Kong's security chief, Chris Tang. More than a hundred people were still missing at the same time. There were also 79 injured, 11 of which were in critical condition. Family members toured hospitals and morgues looking for victims.
It is the deadliest building fire worldwide since 1980, excluding fires in nightclubs, prisons or shopping centers, according to research in the disaster database at the University of Leuven (Belgium). It is also the most serious in Hong Kong since 1948.
It is still unknown to what extent the balance could increase due to the number of people about whom there is still no news. Among the missing people, there are 19 Filipino and 11 Indonesian domestic workers, according to data from the Mission for Migrant Workers organization cited by the local newspaper South China Morning Post (SCMP). Firefighters finished their inspection of all homes today, Friday.
What caused the tragedy?
The initial causes of the fire have not been rigorously established. The security chief admitted that the investigation could take three or four weeks. Based on preliminary findings, Tang said that the fire started in the lower parts of the shipyard's nets that protected against dust and falling objects.
The spread of the flames, according to Tang, was favored by the use of bamboo for scaffolding, common in Hong Kong, and flammable materials such as foam panels that protected the windows. Hong Kong fire chief Andy Yeung also corroborated what many witnesses interviewed by AFP said. “We found that the alarm systems in the eight buildings were not working properly,” he said.
Who is responsible?
The anti-corruption commission announced today the arrest of seven men and one woman, aged between 40 and 63. These are two people responsible for the project office that prepared the renovation, two construction managers, three scaffolding subcontractors and an intermediary.
The police had already announced the arrest of three suspects for “gross negligence” after the discovery of flammable materials abandoned during work, which allowed the fire to “spread quickly” due to the strong wind. The exact level of involvement of the suspects in starting the fire is unclear. Authorities ordered the inspection of all public housing complexes undergoing major renovations, according to the SCMP newspaper.
What is the fire risk in Hong Kong?
Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China with 7.5 million inhabitants, is one of the most densely populated places in the world, which increases the risk of urban disasters. The average population density is more than 7,100 inhabitants per square kilometer, with vast steep and unbuildable areas.
In urbanized areas, population density is up to three times higher, a world record. This financial center, where space is limited and real estate prices are among the highest in the world, is famous for the skyscrapers surrounding the bay. The last few decades have been marked by the construction of a profusion of residential towers that can have more than 50 floors.
Most of the new construction projects have taken place in the mainland of the green New Territories region, where the Tai Po neighborhood is located. Hong Kong has 569 buildings over 150 meters tall, the highest number in the world, according to data from the specialized international NGO CTBUH (Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat).</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Deadliest fire since 1918 leads to investigation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/28/hong-kong-fogo-mais-mortifero-desde-1918-origina-investigacao/</link><description>There have been 128 deaths and 200 people missing in what was the biggest fire in the history of Hong Kong, in the New Territories. Authorities have, however, moved towards an anti-corruption investigation given the scale of the incident in Tai Po. The Lusa agency reports the despair of many families
The tragedy is far from abating in Hong Kong. The fire that occurred this Wednesday in the Tai Po area, in the New Territories, in a complex of buildings under construction, is already considered one of the largest in the history of the territory and the victims are still being counted – at the time of writing this edition there were 55 dead and 250 people missing. Today, Friday, the numbers rose to 128 dead and 200 missing. Yesterday, at the end of the day, the fire was gradually coming under control, with another 55 survivors being rescued.
According to a report from the Lusa agency, the families of those missing remained in a feeling of despair yesterday, given the lack of answers. “Did you see this girl?” a mother asks the Lusa journalist in Cantonese, before switching to English. “Did you see my daughter or the ‘helper’?” he says, using the expression used in Hong Kong for domestic workers.
The woman, surnamed Cheng, waves a piece of paper on which she has printed a photograph of her five-year-old daughter, Hannah Cheng, and a copy of the work permit of the maid, Indonesian Maryan. The family lived in Wang Tai House, part of the Wang Fuk Court residential complex that burned down.
A spokeswoman for the Indonesian consulate in Hong Kong confirmed to the South China Morning Post that the dead included two Indonesian maids.
"I haven't seen them since the fire started. Please, have you seen them?", pleads Cheng to everyone he meets at the entrance to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole, the hospital located closest to the social housing complex, in Tai Po.
The fire department said it had already managed to contact several of the 279 people who were initially listed as missing. The temperature “is very high and there are floors where we cannot contact the people who called for help, but we will continue to try”, assured the deputy director of the fire department, Derek Armstrong Chan.
A post was circulating on social media from another mother, desperate for not being able to contact her in-laws, who were taking care of her six-month-old daughter, in Wang Fuk Court.
"Almost 24 hours have passed [since the last contact] (…) My daughter needs to be breastfed otherwise she will die. Can anyone tell me if she was saved or not?", wrote Winnie Hui.
This is already the deadliest fire since 1918, when Hong Kong was still a British colony. That year, a fire caused the collapse of the main grandstand at the Happy Valley racecourse, causing more than 600 deaths. More than 700 firefighters are involved in fighting the flames, in addition to rescue teams and police.
Population helps
As the hours passed, support from the population began to arrive, both in terms of physical and financial presence, at various shelters for the homeless. Serena, 16, was carrying a box of bottled water to deliver to a secondary school in Tai Po, converted into one of the temporary shelters for those affected by the fire.
In addition to the 900 residents of the Wang Fuk Court residential complex, authorities ordered residents of the nearby Kwong Fuk Estate to evacuate their homes as a precaution.
“This is my school, but we don't have classes today because of the fire”, explains the young woman to Lusa, who joined several colleagues to buy and donate supplies, including cookies and instant pasta. The school is just over two kilometers from the residential complex that burned down.
On the second day, columns of smoke continued to rise into the sky, with the smell of burning in the air. “Everyone knows someone who lived in Wang Fuk”, highlights Serena. “We never thought this could happen here”, he adds.
But it is not only in Tai Po, located closer to the border with the metropolis of Shenzhen than to the center of Hong Kong, that the population has mobilized to help. An elderly woman came from Tuen Mun, 30 kilometers away, with blankets and clothes. “It’s not enough for someone who lost everything they had”, laments the resident, surnamed Fong.
The social neighborhood, built in the 1980s, is made up of eight towers with nearly 30 floors and a total of 1,984 apartments, where around four thousand people lived. According to the local press, the fire also led many people to try to donate blood, running out of appointments in the center of Causeway Bay yesterday.
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Government created a fund this Thursday with 300 million Hong Kong dollars for the victims. At a press conference, postponed twice, the Chief Executive, John Lee Ka-chiu, said that the fund, created at the state-owned Bank of China, began accepting donations from 7pm.
John Lee also announced that the Government would distribute, throughout the day, 10 thousand Hong Kong dollars to each family affected by the fire in the Wang Fuk Court social housing complex.
Ongoing investigations
The scale of the tragedy has already led Hong Kong authorities to move forward with an anti-corruption investigation. Hong Kong's Independent Anti-Corruption Commission has set up “a working group to launch a full investigation into possible corruption in the major Wang Fuk Court renovation project in Tai Po.”
In a statement, the commission justified the decision with “the immense public interest involved”. There are now three working groups: one to investigate the fire, another to deal with emergency donation resources and one for the relocation of affected families.
Meanwhile, police arrested three men on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter after discovering flammable materials left during maintenance work that led to the fire spreading quickly through the bamboo floors.
John Lee, Chief Executive of the HKSAR, said the Department of Home Affairs and Youth has reserved 1,000 apartments in youth hostels and hotels for affected residents to stay for a maximum period of two weeks. They will then be moved to 1,800 subsidized apartments reserved for them to settle in temporarily, he added.
The official also indicated that the Government is preparing a list of goods that Hong Kong will request from China's central government, including unmanned aircraft ('drones') for inspections and materials for laboratory tests.
Meanwhile, inspections are also being carried out at all real estate complexes that are undergoing major works. “The Government ordered the inspection of all real estate complexes in the city that are undergoing major renovations, to check the safety of scaffolding and construction materials,” said John Lee Ka-chiu in a message published on the social network Facebook. The complex of eight 31-storey buildings was undergoing facade renovations.
Campaign suspended
The leader of the Hong Kong Government admitted yesterday that the elections for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, scheduled for December 7, could be postponed. “We will carry out a thorough analysis and make a decision within a few days, based on the overall interests of Hong Kong,” said John Lee Ka-chiu, after an emergency meeting with heads of various government departments. The Chief Executive added that the debates between candidates for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong that were scheduled for Thursday and today have been postponed, with no new date set. The remaining election campaign activities were also suspended, John Lee told journalists. "The Government is committed to dealing with this major disaster. Our priority now is to fight the fire", highlighted the leader. "The top priority is to extinguish the fire and rescue the trapped residents. The second task is to treat the injured, the third is to deal with the consequences, and then we will carry out a thorough investigation," Lee added. "As for other matters, we will decide what to do in a few days, after we coordinate our work," said the government leader.
Leaders react
Xi Jinping, Chinese President, yesterday expressed condolences for the victims of the fire, calling for “intense rescue efforts to minimize losses”, reported the Xinhua agency. The President also declared that he gave great importance to the accident, having immediately requested permanent updates on the work of the rescue team. Xi Jinping instructed the director of the Central Government Liaison Office in Hong Kong to convey condolences. Another political leader who also spoke out about the tragedy was the Prime Minister of Timor-Leste, Xanana Gusmão. He referred to the death of the 128 people as “tragic” and “deeply painful”. “Our hearts are with the families and friends of all those who lost their lives, as well as with those who remain missing”, he highlighted, in a press release. Xanana Gusmão also paid tribute to the “extraordinary courage of firefighters, first responders and all those who work tirelessly in rescue and recovery operations”.</description><pubDate>2025-11-28 20:29:00</pubDate></item><item><title>OECD | World economy expected to slow to 2.9% in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/ocde-economia-mundial-deve-abrandar-para-29-em-2026/</link><description>The OECD predicts that global economic growth will slow down in 2026, falling from 3.2 percent this year to 2.9 percent next year, with economic activity facing “fragile prospects”, associated with the impact of tariffs on global trade.
In the Economic Perspectives report, released yesterday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) points to a moderation in the trajectory of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) globally, with growth slowing from 3.3 percent recorded in 2024 to 3.2 percent in 2025 and to 2.9 percent in 2026, followed by a “small recovery” to 3.1 percent in 2027.
“Growth is expected to slow down during the second half of this year [2025], as the anticipation of activity unfolds and higher effective customs duties on imports to the United States and China are reflected in company costs and final product prices, harming investment and trade growth”, describes the organization.
“The projections are based on the technical assumption that the bilateral tariffs announced in mid-November will be maintained for the rest of the projection period, despite ongoing legal challenges in the United States”, he highlights.
In the introduction to the report, OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann highlights that “the global economy has proven resilient this year, despite concerns about a more pronounced slowdown following the increase in trade barriers and significant political uncertainty”.
However, it warns that the increase in customs duties should “gradually lead to higher prices, reducing the growth of household consumption and business investment”.
“These prospects remain fragile”, warns the organization’s top official, stressing that if there is an increase in tariffs, this movement is expected to cause “significant damage to supply chains and global production” and there is a risk that high asset valuations, made “based on optimistic expectations of corporate profits” driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI), will lead to “potentially abrupt price corrections”.
Asia on the rise
In the document, the OECD notes that “high geopolitical and political uncertainty will also continue to weigh on domestic demand in many economies”, with emerging Asian economies expected to continue to be “responsible for the majority of global growth”.
For the United States of America, the OECD predicts GDP growth to be “2.0 percent in 2025, 1.7 percent in 2026 and 1.9 percent in 2027”.
China is expected to grow 5.0 percent in 2025, 4.4 percent in 2026 and 4.3 percent in 2027. In the second world economy, says the organization, “the end of the anticipation of exports, the imposition of higher customs duties on exports to the United States, the continued adjustment in the real estate sector and the weakening of budgetary support are expected to reduce growth”.
Eurozone growth “is expected to slow slightly, from 1.3 percent in 2025 to 1.2 percent in 2026, before increasing to 1.4 percent in 2027, with increased trade frictions being offset by improved financial conditions, continued capital spending from Recovery and Resilience Mechanism funds, and the resilience of labor markets,” says the OECD.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 08:08:06</pubDate></item><item><title>East Timor | April Revolution left “difficult memories”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/27/timor-leste-revolucao-de-abril-deixou-memorias-dificeis/</link><description>Marisa Ramos Gonçalves, researcher at the University of Coimbra, addresses, in a study, the experiences of the Timorese during the period of the 25th of April
Marisa Ramos Gonçalves, a researcher at the Center for Social Sciences at the University of Coimbra, considered that the April revolution in Timor-Leste left “difficult memories” and that reconciliation is fundamental for “national cohesion”.
“When we talk about the 25th of April in Timor, we know that we are talking about difficult memories that have left marks to this day due to the internal conflict and the violation of human rights during the occupation”, Marisa Ramos Gonçalves, who is currently carrying out a study on that period in the country, told Lusa.
Marisa Ramos Gonçalves is also a member of the International Advisory Board of the National Chega Center (in Timor-Leste), which, among other activities, documents the history of the conflict in Timor-Leste between 1974 and 1999.
The researcher explained to Lusa that the objective is to understand the other side of the story “based on the experiences of the Timorese of the 25th of April and this period of transition, which gives rise to a proclamation of independence, but which is very short compared to the occupation”.
“This collective memory of the Timorese is inseparable, both from the internal conflict and from the human tragedy that is the Indonesian invasion and occupation”, highlighted Marisa Ramos Gonçalves.
The unilateral proclamation of Timor-Leste's independence, on November 28, 1975, came after a period marked by clashes between the East Timorese and already under the shadow of the possibility of occupation of the territory by Indonesia, which came to fruition on December 7, 1975. Asked about reconciliation between East Timorese, the researcher said that the “issue has been on the table”.
"It is necessary to achieve reconciliation between Timorese who were on opposite sides during the civil conflict with different options for the future of Timor. At the time, UDT wanted an association with Portugal for a few more years before independence, Fretilin wanted immediate independence, and Apodeti, which wanted integration into Indonesia and they are all Timorese", he stated.
According to Marisa Gonçalves, the National Chega Center wants “this to start being on the table, because it has not been easy until now for Timorese who suffered torture or were persecuted during the period of internal conflict to speak openly”.
"But we are already beginning to see this possibility when talking about violence and torture, which existed for a very short period in 1975, but which left strong marks. There is also a reconciliation at the level of political leadership that is yet to be achieved and I think this is also complicated. It is a reconciliation of the entire society", stated Marisa Ramos Gonçalves.
Larger opening
Considering reconciliation between Timorese people as fundamental for social cohesion, the researcher highlights, on the other hand, that the new generations formed in the Indonesian period and the younger ones “are completely prepared for this reconciliation”.
“They are not so tied to previous conflicts and they really want to reconcile and, therefore, I think they are already looking at that future, they already think that all people are part of the Timorese Nation, including the Timorese who are in West Timor”, where there is a community of around 80,000 people, he highlighted.
"It is also important that the older generation reconciles, especially because it is still a generation, the so-called generation of 75, that continues in power. It would also be interesting for them to take the initiative to get closer", he added.
Regarding the study she is carrying out, Marisa Ramos Gonçalves said that there is a lack of historical research in Timor-Leste and that it is good to understand the expectations that people had not only in relation to the 25th of April, but also in relation to the political transition.
“It means knowing the narratives, the experiences, the memories of Timorese people of various geographic origins, professional occupations and party affiliations about the same historical moment”, he explained, highlighting that reconciliation is also achieved through the writing of history.</description><pubDate>2025-11-27 02:00:20</pubDate></item><item><title>November 25th | Manuel Geraldes remembers “moment of betrayal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/26/25-de-novembro-manuel-geraldes-recorda-momento-de-traicao/</link><description>Portugal marked the 50th anniversary of November 25, 1975 yesterday with a military parade and a solemn session in the Assembly of the Republic, amidst controversies and political readings from right to left. Manuel Geraldes, a former soldier based in Macau, remembers the moment he was arrested at RTP
For Manuel Geraldes, if happiness had a date it would be April 25, 1974, along with the day his daughter was born. But it was in connection with the 50th anniversary of November 25, 1975, an attempted coup d'état and one of the stages of the revolutionary process that began with the overthrow of the dictatorship in Portugal on April 25, 1974, that we spoke with the former soldier.
Based in Macau since the 1980s, Manuel Geraldes was arrested at RTP on November 25, 1975, but, as one of the youngest captains of April, he was involved in the revolution since its beginning, starting with the so-called captains' movement in 1973.
To HM, he remembers the 25th of November as “a very sad moment, of betrayal by comrades, revolt, a horrible moment, especially compared to one of the happiest days of my life, together with the birth of my daughter, which was the 25th of April”, taking into account the military plans planned for that day, which took a different turn. Manuel Geraldes worked at RTP when the station was controlled by one of the military factions that carried out the 25th of November. Control of RTP, at the Lumiar studios in Lisbon, included the intervention of figures such as Manuel Duran Clemente, then linked to the military extreme left of the 5th Division.
"When we talk about the 25th of November we have to talk about a day of betrayal. Those who were betrayed were the soldiers who remained faithful to their ideas of the 25th of April and who swore to comply with it, and which we were fulfilling. There was a group of soldiers who, forgetting their condition, and I'm talking more about permanent staff officers, made that day of shame for any self-respecting officer."
Manuel Geraldes had been at RTP for about a year and was “caught in that trap”. I went to meet my comrades at the television news management office and it was there that we were caught by Captain Duran Clemente”, he tells HM.
“I can talk about those who were closest to me, and who were at RTP that day”, he began by saying. "Those who were on the 25th of April and arrested me, as they arrested six other officers, all of them 'dangerous fascists, reactionaries'. Also arrested that day was a man who was a great revolutionary, and who, still as a student at the military academy, studying at Técnico, committed the noble gesture of leaving the armed forces of the fascist regime to emigrate to northern Europe. The 'powerful' Marques, who had been in the Beja coup, and who was arrested, and managed to go into exile in Brazil. Captain Canavilhas, a ‘dangerous’ man who had been on the 25th of April and who was there providing a service to the Republic at RTP as an electrical engineer.”
Duran Clemente appeared at RTP's facilities to control broadcasts, prohibit the dissemination of information from the Presidency of the Republic, since Costa Gomes was President at the time, and let messages from rebels linked to a faction of the movement pass through. The station's board of directors was detained for several hours. His live images are known on RTP, reading a statement, when he was suddenly interrupted and replaced in the broadcast by the film “The Man from the Diner’s Club”. This is because the winning faction of the 25 de Novembro movement had taken control of events from the RTP studios in Porto.
Speaking to the newspaper Público, Duran Clemente also speaks of November 25th as “a betrayal of April 25th, in the way it has been interpreted and was interpreted, to the extent that it interrupted the natural course of a revolution that is never a natural path”.
Duran Clemente also speaks, in the same interview, of the “fantasy story of a civil war” that many believe was about to happen in Portugal on that date. He also says “he did not commit any crime”.
For Manuel Geraldes, these moments of detention “were indescribable, unbelievable, forgettable”. When he left the RTP studios, Manuel Geraldes went home to his wife, “trying to rest and try to forget the enormous sadness that was that scene”, with “the soldiers he had commanded on April 25, 1974, observing that absurd arrest that Duran Clemente made of us”.
The culmination of tensions
The 25th of November was an attempted coup d'état in which military personnel linked to the extreme left took several strategic points, especially in Lisbon, which led the country to enter a state of siege. But the moderates won and the country entered a calmer phase, especially after the new Constitution of 1976. It was a culmination of the so-called “Hot Summer”, or the months of the PREC – Revolutionary Period in Progress, marked by nationalizations of banks and companies, the Agrarian Reform process, organization of workers committees, attacks on the headquarters of the Portuguese Communist Party and various actions connoted with both the extreme left and the far right.
Manuel Geraldes recalls that “the situation was complex and was not exactly what we had imagined” with the 25th of April. “We had designed other scenarios than that, but with great camaraderie.” Even so, the former soldier highlights the “stability and credibility” that Portugal gained after November 25, 1975. However, he does not agree with the fact that the Portuguese authorities are currently celebrating this date.
"There is definitely a political component and, for me, it makes absolutely no sense. We shouldn't forget the past to correct any mistakes that were made, but celebrating a sad day makes no sense at all. We must remember."
Regarding the important and decisive figures in resolving the 25th of November, Manuel Geraldes highlights “general Costa Gomes, who experienced such vast violence, Sousa e Castro and others who had consensus and managed to bring the vast majority of the armed forces to reason”. Mário Soares, as leader of the Socialist Party, “also had [importance]” to stop the movement, especially because “he had positions close to the so-called ‘Group of Nine’, the moderate members of the Coordinating Commission of the Armed Forces Movement”.
Manuel Geraldes also remembers a day when the factions were ruled by “military against military”, and when “the homeland was put at risk”, in a scenario “very, very close to civil war”.  Yesterday morning, a military ceremony took place promoted by the Armed Forces, at Praça do Comércio, in Lisbon, presided over by the President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. There was also a formal session in the Assembly of the Republic.
Vasco Lourenço: “A coup d’état was not on the ground”
In addition to the official ceremonies of the 25th of November 1975, there have been several exhibitions, lectures and conferences that celebrate all stages of the revolution of the 25th of April 1974. One of them took place on Tuesday, the seminar “25th of November – 50 years later”, at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, where one of the central figures of the 25th of November and the entire April revolution, Vasco Lourenço, remembered the day.
"It is clear that, after all this time, we cannot say that a coup d'état was on the ground. But I challenge anyone who is capable of saying that, at that time, given what was happening, we did not look at it as if a coup d'état were actually taking place."
After several military movements, in which the paratrooper forces retreated, the episodes of November 25th resulted in three deaths, all military personnel, “at the beginning of November 27th”, recalled Vasco Lourenço.
The role of women
Another figure who participated in the debate was doctor Isabel do Carmo, who at the time of November 25th was linked to the COPCON group – Continent Operational Command, led by the now deceased Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho.
Isabel do Carmo argued that “what happened after the 25th of April was the existence of a space of people, organizations and political protagonists, in which there were clearly two trends”, marked by “those who wanted to lead a revolutionary movement to de facto socialism, and those who wanted a liberal democracy with an economy regulated by a market”.
"The 25th of April was, and for many people of my generation, the best times of my life. I hear many people say this, particularly women, who until then were discreet. What happened after [the 25th of April] were the public sessions, freedom of the press, the total change in the environment in schools, there was a great transformation in the country", concluded Isabel do Carmo.</description><pubDate>2025-11-26 01:15:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Timorese women victims of sexual violence during the war demand an end to discrimination</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/24/mulheres-timorenses-vitimas-de-violencia-sexual-da-guerra-exigem-fim-da-discriminacao/</link><description>Reporting by Domingos Freitas, from the Lusa agency
The Pirilampo association, which represents women victims of sexual violence between 1974 and 1999, demands that the Timorese State supports them, after years of discrimination by society and their families.
"We continue to fight alone because we were victims in the past, not of our own free will. We have suffered the consequences of this country's politics since 1974, because we wanted self-determination. Because of these political decisions, we, women, were the target of many sexual violations", Maria Isabel da Silva, president of Pirilampo, told Lusa, as part of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence and Indonesian occupation.
Maria Isabel da Silva accused the Timorese State of not having granted them recognition that could help them recover their courage and dignity.
"We created Pirilampo because we know that we are not minor survivors. We are survivors of sexual violence that occurred during the war, between 1974 and 1999. We want to recover dignity, because many face stigma in their communities and even within their own families", explained Maria Isabel da Silva.
The president of Pirilampo explained that the organization's mission is to support women survivors of sexual violence through social, legal and economic assistance so that they become strong and independent citizens. The association also defends the rights of victims and survivors who remain without a voice, so that they can obtain recognition and attention from the State or Government.
Maria Isabel da Silva clarified that Pirilampo's vision is to contribute to ensuring that Timorese society never again allows anyone to be a victim of serious human rights violations, especially sexual violence, including harassment, abuse, rape or forced marriage.
The president of Pirilampo also regretted that cultural aspects discriminate against women who became pregnant or had children by unidentified men. "Sometimes they are considered prostitutes, remnants of the Indonesian military. These are insults that have been directed at us for a long time," he said.
With support from the Chega Ba Ita Association (ACBIT) and Asia Justice and Rights (AJAR), several victims participated in various activities and, on October 22, 2022, these organizations helped them create the Klibur Survivor Feto Firefly 1974-1999, to alleviate the suffering and difficulties faced.
Pirilampo has already registered 455 women survivors of sexual violence, of which 87 gave birth to children resulting from these violations. To this day, those children, often called “war children”, face a very difficult life, due to discrimination by their families, society and, above all, in the public administration.
"They call them children of unknown fathers, children of bush men, of militia. This greatly affects their self-esteem and many refuse to go to school", warned the president. Maria Isabel Silva explains that many of these young people are also unable to obtain basic documents, such as baptism certificates from the Church or State documents. They live in remote areas, depend on agriculture and do not have adequate access to health and education.
The president called on the Government to pay attention and recognize these people like any other citizen, so that their children can also live in freedom and equality. "We are alive. We don't ask for anything, we don't ask for money. The money from the State is not enough to pay for our dignity. We lost our bodies, we carry pain and trauma. We just want to recover our complete being. We don't ask for money", said an emotional Maria Isabel Silva.
There is still discrimination
Fernanda Guterres and Maria Gusmão were born after their mothers were raped by Indonesian soldiers during the occupation of Timor-Leste, and to this day they continue to face discrimination in their country. The two carry the stigma of being “war children”, a name given to people who were born to women who were raped between 1974 and 1999, during the conflict between various Timorese factions and during the Indonesian occupation.
"I don't feel free, because I continue to face discrimination from society. Colleagues say words to me that hurt me, and I myself am afraid of making friends because of the harsh words they say to me", Fernanda Guterres, who works at the non-governmental organization ACBIT, which supports, with Asia Justice and Rights (AJAR), the "children of war" and women victims of sexual violence during the occupation to overcome the difficulties and traumas that marked their lives, told Lusa.
“I only feel a little freedom when I participate in oratory sessions or in training given by the sisters, which encourage young people to face reality”, he highlighted. The report by the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation (CAVR), released 20 years ago, and which collected testimonies from hundreds of victims of sexual violence, states that the majority was committed by the Indonesian occupation forces.
"We are Children of War because our mothers were forced and impregnated by other men during the occupation. Otherwise, the invaders would have killed the entire family. To save their own lives, many Timorese women suffered sexual violence", explained Fernanda Guterres. As a consequence of this forced rape, “war children” continue to be targets of insults and stigma. “You have no father”, “you are the son of the enemy” or “son of a militia”, are some of the insults that those women continue to hear.
When she was little, Fernanda Guterres' mother told her that her father was alive, but she never met him. She later discovered that it didn't exist, but her mother never explicitly admitted it. "I asked about my mother and father many times. My mother always said 'your father is there', and said not to believe if someone said otherwise. But I never met him. In the end, I realized that I didn't have a father", he said.
Fernanda Guterres also remembers, with sadness, the attempts of sexual violence by members of the community, solely due to her mother's past. "The family and also some neighbors tried to abuse me. When I was an adult, I stopped keeping quiet and asked my family to face anyone who tried to harm me", said the 28-year-old.
Today, Fernanda has her own family, with three children, and said she has found a partner who fully supports her. "I met my husband thanks to God's plan. He knew about my mother's past and his whole family knew too, but they never discriminated against me. They always welcomed me. My husband supports me, gives me courage. The past is behind us. Now we look to the future and our children. That's what gives me strength", she stated.
"We live a simple life. We don't have formal jobs, but we always maintain respect and mutual understanding. When a problem arises at home, we talk and look for a solution together," he said. Fernanda Guterres managed to obtain documents from the Church or State, thanks to the support of people who helped her regularize everything.
Maria Gusmão also acknowledged that her mother was a victim of sexual violence by Indonesian soldiers. "When I was little, in primary school and pre-secondary school, I suffered discrimination due to the conflict my mother faced. They said I was the daughter of the militia, the daughter of the enemy. I heard this with my own ears", said the young woman from Covalima.
He also remembers that some members of his community even banned children from playing with him. Later, at university and even within his family, he continued to face discrimination. Despite this, Maria Robinson appealed to other young women not to lose their will to fight, nor their hope, even in the face of discrimination, highlighting that the State must dignify women who have been victims of sexual violence and also their children.
Maria Robinson was able to obtain documents because her stepfather agreed to put her name on the birth certificates. When asked about her feeling of freedom, she replied that she just feels “a little free”, highlighting that she still faces discrimination, stigma and injustice today. “From the family, to society, to the community and even to our own State”, said the 25-year-old. Maria Robinson recently completed her degree at the University of Peace (UNPAZ) and also works at the non-governmental organization ACBIT.
On November 28, Timor-Leste marks 50 years since the unilateral declaration of independence and Indonesian occupation, on December 7, 1975. The restoration of independence took place on May 20, 2002, after a referendum for self-determination was held on August 30, 1999.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 20:06:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Scams | Request for AI and more international cooperation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/burlas-pedido-recurso-a-ia-e-mais-cooperacao-internacional/</link><description>Chan Lai Kei, deputy linked to the Fujian Community, wants artificial intelligence to be able to access links received by mobile phone users via SMS, in order to alert them to fraudulent links
Deputy Chan Lai Kei calls on the Government to use the most advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, to identify and prevent online scams. The matter was addressed through a written question from the legislator linked to the Fujian community.
According to Chan, “technological advances” mean that “fraudulent schemes continue to proliferate”, despite the police in Macau having “persistently updated their anti-fraud mechanisms”.
According to data from the Judiciary Police (PJ) cited by the deputy, between November 7th and midday on November 14th, authorities received complaints about 280 fraud attempts in which criminals pretended to be different customer support services and also complaints about 28 attempts in which fraudsters pretended to be police officers, Public Prosecutor's Office agents or Interior Courts.
Complaints were received through applications made available by the authorities. “This indicates that specific types of fraud continue to be prevalent”, says the deputy. “Although these reports have not resulted in real losses, the number of cases indicates that anti-fraud advertising and technical interception measures need to be improved”, he highlights.
Get to work
In this scenario, Chan wants to know if the authorities will create a system using artificial intelligence, so that citizens can receive “instant alerts” when they receive SMS messages considered “high risk”. The legislator therefore advocates that authorities implement a system capable of detecting the content of SMS received by all citizens.
The defense of the measure is justified by what the deputy considers “the recent increase in fake customer service SMS scams”, which in his opinion “indicates the need to further improve the application's proactive alert features”.
As part of its defense of the measure, Chan Lai Kei points out that the “Anti-Fraud Program”, which residents can install on the Wechat platform, has blocked more than 9,000 high-risk operations since its launch in April 2024. At the same time, the deputy is concerned about fraud committed in other countries, such as Myanmar, where large fraud centers operate, often linked to mafias in mainland China.
Without mentioning the countries most involved, Chan warns that part of the phenomenon is outside Macau and therefore requires greater international cooperation, despite recognizing the cooperation developed with Hong Kong and Singapore. The deputy supported by the Fujian community therefore wants to know how the authorities will detect the place of origin of the crimes and reinforce international cooperation.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:42:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Housing for exchange | Alert for payment deadline</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/habitacao-para-troca-alerta-para-fim-de-prazo-para-pagar/</link><description>Macau Urban Renewal issued a warning yesterday to applicants for exchange homes in the Pearl Metropolis complex, informing them that they have until January 30th to “complete the purchase procedures, pay the price of the units” and present proof of registration proving the transaction.

Deputy Nick Lei hopes that the Government will remain alert to fire safety needs, and ensure effective supervision on construction sites. The matter was addressed by the deputy linked to the Fujian community, through a written interpellation.
The position is taken following the fire in the residential complex in Tai Po, Hong Kong, which resulted in 156 deaths, according to the most recent count, at a time when victims of two residential towers still remain to be counted. The preliminary causes of the fire were related to the materials installed in the renovation work of the residential complex.
Now, Nick Lei has come to recall that after the fire the authorities inspected 60 construction sites with scaffolding, so he wants to know what will be done to correct flaws that have been identified. “In response to the flaws discovered during inspections, how is a permanent review mechanism established to ensure that construction materials meet fire safety standards (…) with a view to effectively raising the level of fire safety on construction sites?”, asks the deputy. Lei also wants to know how to “completely resolve the issue of installing obstacles in corridors” used as emergency exits.
More specific plans
Furthermore, the deputy linked to the Fujian community argues that current relief plans must be more specific to respond to the needs of population density, types of local construction and environmental characteristics of the different areas of the territory.
Nick Lei also wants the Government to clarify emergency response procedures, to guarantee the safety of the population when there are major catastrophes. Lei also points out that Macau can obtain support from neighboring areas in a timely manner, if it has plans to do so.
As for advanced emergency response equipment, Nick Lei wants to know what high-tech means will be imported to assist in rescue work, with the aim of improving firefighting capacity in specific environments, such as tall and older buildings.
“The Government must reinforce safety inspection in public spaces and places, particularly with regard to the preparation of fire-fighting plans in low-rise buildings in community neighborhoods and buildings that do not have an administration entity or condominiums”, he advised. Nick Lei argued that in this way “the efficiency of evacuating buildings in an emergency situation can be increased”, reads the written interpellation.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:35:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Taiwan | Proposed law targets Macau residents</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/02/taiwan-proposta-de-lei-visa-residentes-de-macau/</link><description>Representatives of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of Taiwan, Wang Ting-yu and Wang Yi-chuan, delivered a proposal to change the lobbying law to the Taiwanese Parliament, to punish individuals from the Interior, Hong Kong and Macau involved in this practice. The measure was presented through a statement and aims to change the law known as anti-infiltration by external agents.
According to Wang Ting-yu's post on his official Facebook, although the current law already prohibits the act of lobbying by individuals, groups, entities or agents of Mainland Hong Kong and Macau in Taiwan, the law does not have any punishment, and is therefore considered inconsequential.
The amendments propose a maximum fine of up to five million Taiwan dollars for each infraction, corresponding to around 1.2 million patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 05:02:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Traffic | Deputy Leong Sun Iok defends fewer zebra crossings on roads</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/02/transito-deputado-leong-sun-iok-defende-menos-passadeiras-nas-estradas/</link><description>Deputy Leong Sun Iok, linked to the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau (FAOM), defends a reduction in the number of zebra crossings to cross roads. The position was taken through a written interpellation, in which the deputy complains that traffic faces too many constraints.
From Leong's perspective, pedestrian crossings are installed with “considerable frequency”, which means that there are “multiple crossings in the same section, with extremely short distance intervals”. “For vehicles, these frequent stops and starts significantly reduce average speeds on the roads and cause localized traffic congestion, negatively affecting the general flow of the road network”, he explained. “How will the authorities find a balance between the needs of pedestrian crossings and the efficiency of traffic on the road network when reviewing and optimizing existing crossings?”, he asked.
Furthermore, the deputy wants to know if the authorities will consider allowing cars to cross red lights to turn left, as happens in other countries. Thus, although there was a red light for those who wanted to go straight ahead or turn right on a street, there would always be the possibility of turning left, because a yellow traffic light would be shown. “Could the authorities explore the possibility of allowing left turns during yellow lights while the traffic lights are red?” he asked.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 04:59:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Maternity leave | Extended Employer Subsidy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/02/licenca-de-maternidade-subsidio-para-empregadores-prolongado-2/</link><description>The Government will extend for another year, until the end of 2026, the period for granting the supplementary subsidy to employers for remuneration paid during maternity leave, the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) said yesterday.
The subsidy began to be distributed after the legal review that extended maternity leave in May 2020 from 56 to 70 days, and would have a maximum limit of 14 additional days of basic pay. The plan was presented as a measure to be applied during a transitional period, “allowing employers to adapt, gradually, to the economic expenses caused by the increase in the number of days of maternity leave”, according to the authorities' explanation at the time. The so-called transition period ended on May 25, 2023, but the subsidy remained.
The new extension will last until December 31, 2026, extending the deadline established by administrative regulation in force since August 26 of this year.
Therefore, employers who pay maternity leave to resident workers who give birth by December 31, 2026, may request DSAL for a maximum benefit equivalent to 14 days of basic pay for the workers in question.
The subsidy plan, presented as part of a package of measures to encourage births, is limited to companies with fewer than 100 employees. Deputy Wong Kit Cheng has argued that the subsidy plan should become permanent and extended to companies with more than a hundred workers.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 04:55:36</pubDate></item><item><title>IC | Merger with ID does not yet have a detailed plan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/02/ic-fusao-com-id-ainda-nao-tem-plano-pormenorizado/</link><description>The president of the Cultural Institute (IC), Deland Leong Wai Man, stated that she is “preparing, in an orderly manner, the work for the combination of services” for the merger with the Sports Institute (ID) and the Culture Development Fund. Despite the “orderly manner”, the person in charge confessed that there are still no detailed plans to organize the aggregation of services, but assured that she maintains close communication with the approximately one thousand employees of the services involved.
According to the newspaper Ou Mun, Deland Leong Wai Man hopes that the combination of entities will result in a synergistic effect known as “one plus one is more than two”, and stressed that the merger of the three departments will not affect the organization of cultural and sporting events next year.
During the presentation of the Lines of Government Action, the Secretary for Administration and Justice Wong Sio Chak indicated that the Directorate of Administration and Public Service Services has completed the plan for the organic restructuring of the administrative machinery.
The restructuring will cover several key departments, including the reorganization of the Government Headquarters Support Services, the Institute for Municipal Affairs and the Public Works Services Directorate, among others.

Maintenance work was taking place in these buildings and the contractors used highly flammable expansive foam to seal windows and the scaffolding used was made of bamboo, which allowed the fire to spread quickly after it started in one of the buildings. Strong winds and dry weather caused the flames to intensify, which subsequently affected the entire housing block. The fire alarms did not go off, contributing to the tragedy.
Around 48 hours after the accident, the Hong Kong Government had practically extinguished the fire. With the help of the Central Government, which sent substantial resources to Hong Kong, and numerous companies that donated money and supplies, the needs were met, allowing the victims to have temporary respite.
At the time of writing this article, the Hong Kong Government has just announced that there have been 146 deaths, 79 injured and 40 missing. Among the dead is a heroic firefighter who died fighting the flames. Before we continue our analysis, let us observe a minute of silence for those who lost their lives and pray for the survivors, hoping that they can soon overcome their difficulties. We also express our highest respect to all the workers and volunteers who participated in the rescue operations, praising their courage and dedication in the face of adversity.
In addition to caring for the victims, the Hong Kong Government also quickly sought to identify those responsible for the accident. For example, the person responsible for maintaining the Hung Fook Court was arrested and is suspected of involuntary manslaughter. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) also ordered the arrest of individuals suspected of corruption. The Hong Kong Government immediately carried out surprise inspections of all protective nets used in building maintenance to ensure they met fire safety standards.
The insurers working with the building maintenance companies also publicly stated that they had activated emergency mechanisms and would provide adequate compensation in accordance with the contracts concluded. In Hong Kong, some people suggested that maintenance companies should use metal scaffolding instead of bamboo scaffolding in the future.
How will the victims deal with the consequences of this disaster? Firstly, the injured must receive immediate treatment. Secondly, they should immediately contact the families to let them know they are safe. We saw many people on television worried about their families, crying and waiting for news. Sending them a message to reassure them is essential. Thirdly, they will have to solve the accommodation problem. If they have another place to live or if they can stay with family or friends, they will need to continue these steps. It is not known when they will be able to return home. If they have no solution, they will have to join the Hong Kong Government's temporary accommodation program. Fourth, assuming the government inspection finds the house is still habitable, should the owners renovate it? Hung Fook Court opened in 1983, more than 40 years ago, and repair work had already begun. This devastating fire accelerated the devaluation of the property. Homeowners should consider whether it is worth making large investments in renovation, given the future value of the homes and the likelihood of them being sold successfully.
In addition to the different reactions of the Hong Kong Government, the public and the victims, this devastating accident has, in fact, raised other issues that concern society.
First, Hong Kong is by nature a city with a high cost of living. A worker who manages to buy a house with the salary he earns during his working life achieves a significant feat. After two or three decades of paying the mortgage, the building has become worn out and needs major work. At that point, owners need to make large investments in maintenance, making the house and the problems it raises seem like a bottomless pit, a black hole impossible to fill. The relationship between homeowners and their homes is reminiscent of the title of a television series – “property slaves.”
Second, following this rare accident, contractors will be more careful about the materials they use. Insurers will also be more careful when entering into contracts with maintenance companies and will impose more stringent requirements. This means that insurance premiums may increase. Homeowners who purchased home and fire insurance may also see their premiums change. All of these factors will fall on home owners, meaning they will bear more expenses. For owners who are still working, this situation is compounded by additional charges. What about retired owners? They may have set up a fund for maintenance before retirement, but with their financial situation after retirement, they may no longer be able to cover these expenses.
This should be an issue for all homeowners who were not directly affected by the fire and potential homebuyers to consider. Although properties in Hong Kong are valuable, they also give rise to many problems. This devastating accident brought new perspectives to the Hong Kong Government, society, victims and potential homebuyers. Let us hope that these new ideas benefit Hong Kong society and prevent similar tragedies.

A military coup had ended a political dictatorship of more than 40 years. The military of the Armed Forces Movement (MFA) had managed to overthrow an oppressive regime that spent years arresting and deporting those who defended freedom, democracy, socialism and communism. The times following the military coup were turbulent because we soon realized that these soldiers also had their political options and were also beginning to play into the hands of this or that political party. Mário Soares and Álvaro Cunhal returned from exile and on the first May 1st the party was thunderous and with a popular union never seen before. As time went by, we saw that the divergences between the MFA military, supported by certain parties, bordered on radicalism.
On September 28, 1974, we witnessed an attempted coup d'état carried out by conservative sectors, led by the President of the Republic, General António de Spínola and where the so-called “silent majority” prevailed at the time, which aimed to halt the democratic process, but, essentially, control decisions on decolonization. The left-wing sector of the MFA managed to ban a demonstration in support of Spínola and we remember that barricades were placed at the entrances to Lisbon in order to prevent the entry of Spínola's supporters. As a result, several organizers of the demonstration were arrested, General Spínola resigned as President of the Republic and the event marked the defeat of the attempt to turn to the right and the strengthening of the MFA's control over the revolutionary process. First important note: never in more than 50 years of democracy have left-wing democrats celebrated the victory of September 28, 1974.
On March 11, 1975, we personally witnessed another attempted coup d'état, this time, commanded by General António de Spínola against the government of the time supported by the left-wing MFA military. The attempt began with the bombing of the Light Artillery Regiment No. 1 (RAL 1) and a soldier who was lying in one of the barracks was killed. The RTP archives must contain images of the piercing of the roof and the blood on the bed and floor of the barracks. RAL 1 was surrounded by paratroopers, assigned to Spínola, and negotiations lasted almost the entire day. The attempt would fail due to the lack of popular support for Spínola and due to the resistance that was registered by the RAL 1 military and many people. The failure of the coup attempt would lead to Spínola's flight to Spain and then to Brazil. Second important note: left-wing democrats in more than 50 years of democracy have never celebrated victory over the attempt to interrupt the revolutionary process.
The summer that followed was very “hot” with several disputes within the MFA and with right-wing parties intensifying their confrontation with the Communist Party and other radical left parties. Everything would end on November 25, 1975.
On that day, the left-wing MFA military occupied RTP and Captain Duran Clemente, while speaking directly at the public television studios, was interrupted from one moment to the next and the broadcast began to be directed from the studios in Porto. Simultaneously at the Military Police barracks, the soldiers on duty there commanded by Major Tomé found themselves confronted by military commandos from the right wing of the MFA, commanded by Captain Jaime Neves and Major Ramalho Eanes. The shooting was a reality. Two military commandos and others from the Military Police died. At the Belém Palace, where the President of the Republic, General Costa Gomes, resided, calls were made for the arrest of the 25th of April strategist, Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, and the illegalization of the Communist Party. At the end of the afternoon, with the Commando troops controlling all operations in their favor, an MFA meeting was held where the moderate wing, led by Major Melo Antunes, managed to ensure that Otelo was not arrested and that the Communist Party remained a legal party at the service of democracy. The 25th of November, a political dispute, but essentially between military personnel, was immediately announced as a “heroic” restoration of the democratic state. Third important note: never in more than 50 years of democracy have right-wing political forces remembered to officially celebrate November 25, 1975.
Last week, we found that the 25th of November was officially celebrated with pomp and circumstance and, obviously, with the support of right-wing and extreme-right political forces, with the disagreement of the Socialist Party and other left-wing political parties and, aggravatingly, the date was celebrated in the Assembly of the Republic with the presence of President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.
The truth is that we witnessed the positions of individuals defending fascist and neo-Nazi policies, stating that the celebrations of November 25th “were much more important than those of April 25th”. We no longer have any doubts that the political system in Portugal is changing. A dangerous change. A change in which racists, xenophobes and neo-Nazis advance proposals in Parliament that garner the support of the elected Montenegro Government, which announces itself as democratic. No, my friends. We must realize that the political change we are witnessing could end in a dictatorship disguised as democracy, where prisons and a lack of press freedom will be a reality.</description><pubDate>2025-12-01 02:06:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Annual report</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/29/relatorio-anual/</link><description>Before we analyze the Government Action Lines Report for the year 2026, let me share a story with you.
On a mountain, there were two monasteries. The monks from Monastery A did not get along very well with each other, while the monks from Monastery B were always cordial with each other. The abbot of Monastery A went to ask the abbot of Monastery B, “why did his monks maintain such friendly relations”.
The abbot of Monastery B replied, “We often make mistakes.” While the abbot of Monastery A was trying to understand the answer, a monk from Monastery B entered the corridor, slipped and fell to the floor. Another monk who was washing the floor immediately ran to apologize for what happened, saying that the floor was wet because of him, while another monk who was standing at the door also came to apologize for not having warned the one who had fallen that the floor was wet. After they helped him to his feet, the first monk said, "Thank you, but it was my fault. I was walking too fast and I wasn't careful." The abbot of Monastery A saw what had just happened and said to the abbot of Monastery B, “Thank you, I think I have the answer to my question.”
For the members of a society to live in harmony, in addition to being aware of the mistakes of others, they must first be aware of their own mistakes. It's easy to pass the blame onto others and it's difficult to take responsibility for ourselves.
Macau is a city with more than 600,000 inhabitants and has substantial revenues from taxation on gambling and tourist activity, so it is not that difficult for the Government to look after all its citizens. In the Government Action Lines Report for the year 2026, it is mentioned that many measures will be implemented to promote the well-being of the population and tax benefits that can meet the needs of the majority of people. Although the content of the Report is full of visionary ideas, and the present budget is quite good, does this mean that there are no aspects that cannot be reviewed and improved?
For example, the Macao SAR Government has yet to publish the results of monitoring suicides for the second quarter of 2025. According to media estimates, based on information from the Security Forces and Services, at least 40 suicides occurred between April and October 2025, and the newspaper Hoje Macau published a report on this subject. On the day of the election of deputies to the 8th Legislature of the Legislative Assembly, last September, the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, was questioned by Hong Kong journalists about non-resident workers and suicides in Macau. Sam Hou Fai did not respond, limiting himself to stating that the questions were not related to the elections and that he would respond on another occasion.
Health Services encourages people who feel hopeless and are experiencing emotional problems to call the Caritas Life Support Line (2852 5222) for advice. For more information about psychological well-being, you can visit the Health Services mental health information webpage. While the helpline and information provided through the mental health webpage are undoubtedly helpful, how can you help those who do not call or visit the webpage? Because suicide numbers for the period indicated above were not published, it does not mean that they did not occur. For Macau to truly be a “happy city”, cases of “discovery of dead bodies” should not be so frequent.
When answering journalists' questions, the Chief Executive mentioned the success of the election for the 8th Legislative Assembly and the first case in Macau involving the State Security Defense Law.
Following the guiding principle “Macau governed by patriots”, the election of deputies for the 8th Legislative Assembly passed smoothly. However, it is regrettable that Lam Yu Tou, who was considered loyal to the Macao SAR in 2021, was disqualified and prevented from running for election to the Legislative Assembly in 2025. On the other hand, the record of 5,987 blank votes and 7,053 invalid votes in these direct elections is quite worrying. As for the trial of the first case in Macau involving the State Security Defense Law, I believe it will probably attract a lot of public attention in 2026.
There should not be too much criticism directed at the Chief Executive and his team, as improving the efficiency of governance and promoting the diversification of the economy is not an easy task and requires the cooperation of all members of society. It is not difficult to list our ten strengths, but listing our ten weaknesses is something that not everyone can do. The Government Action Lines Report for the year 2026 is well written, but what citizens want above all is that its practical result will be equally excellent.</description><pubDate>2025-11-29 06:49:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Germany's Strategic Awakening (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/27/o-despertar-estrategico-da-alemanha-ii/</link><description>“The claim that a state’s security interest necessarily coincides with that of its citizens appears downright absurd.”
Ole Nymoen
If the draconian dictates of the Morgenthau Plan proposed by the United States in 1944 to demilitarize and deindustrialize Germany after World War II, transforming it into an agrarian country and incapable of starting new conflicts remained a dead letter, it was only because, in those same months, awareness of a fundamental conflict in Europe with the Soviet Union began to mature in the United States. As the weeks went by, the priority stopped being the neutralization of Germany and became preventing Moscow from absorbing it into its sphere of influence. In the interpretation of several American officials at the time, before reaching the Atlantic, the Red Army would have to seize the industrial capabilities of the Rhineland and the Ruhr region, the historic heart of German industry, with emphasis on the coal, steel, chemical, energy and logistics sectors.
Hence the need to rebuild a West German state and direct its economic, human and technological potential against Soviet expansionism. Summarized in a 1949 CIA document, the United States' objective became “the permanent control of German power”. Eighty years later, the contours have changed, not the substance. Today, for Washington, the challenge of the century is called China, and the costs of defending the Old Continent must fall on the Europeans. France and the United Kingdom's financial room for maneuver is limited, also due to their expensive nuclear arsenals. And, from the point of view of the Poles, Balts and Scandinavians, Russia is an existential threat, to be contained and eroded by all means. Everything points in a single direction, which is German rearmament. According to this logic, it will be up to Germany to ensure the critical mass of economic resources and conventional forces that the remaining Western partners cannot or do not want to mobilize.
Naturally, an essential assumption of this bet is that Berlin does not act on its own, building a sphere of influence or pursuing strictly national interests. Only then can it be understood that the Federal Republic, whose legal system theoretically prohibits even the sending of weapons to areas of armed conflict, is currently debating whether to place troops on the ground in Ukraine. In recent years, the Germans have broken several long-standing taboos, such as the debt brake, but this would be, for obvious reasons, the most clamorous. Thus, in August, at the end of the Washington summit, Merz stressed that Germany has a “fundamental interest” in cooperating to offer guarantees to Kiev, with the image of the chancellor in the role of a sinister Uncle Sam, accompanied by the caption that “Merz wants to send you to Ukraine? Not us!” To this day, this is not only an unpopular perspective according to a recent poll, as 51 percent of Germans are against it and only 36 percent are in favor, but it is also technically impractical.
Despite the significant increase in military expenditure, the number of personnel in the German Armed Forces continues to decline and age. The objective of 203,000 units by 2031 seems out of reach, a goal that the strategic community of Berlin-Mitte, the most central and historic district of Berlin, considered the political, cultural and tourist heart of the German capital, considers totally insufficient to meet current German security needs. In the last three years, the approximately 180 thousand employees have decreased slightly. It is difficult to imagine that the military service reform recently approved by the federal government could represent the solution, as recruitment, for now, will continue to be voluntary. We are not, therefore, faced with a linear process. But it is worth remembering that, no matter how much legions of experts strive every day to present German rearmament as the panacea for all the ills of the West, it continues to be a high-risk bet.
Above all because the European strategic context is radically different from the one that, in the post-war period, led Washington to allow itself to be convinced by London and Paris not to abandon Europe. At the time, it was French leaders, particularly figures like Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet, who firmly argued that any withdrawal of American troops would have “disastrous consequences” for the national security of the victors. And in the United States there was full awareness that the rapprochement between France and Germany was a fundamental condition for giving solidity to the Western bloc. As Secretary of State Dean Acheson, who played a central role in formulating American foreign policy during the early years of the Cold War, stated in 1949, “Only France can take the decisive lead in the integration of Germany in Western Europe… if it is to avoid Russian or German or perhaps Russian-German domination in Europe.”
Having all due consideration for the pro-European rhetoric, without the security guarantees of the United States there would not have been any Franco-German axis, the true engine of European integration. The proof is there for all to see and is it a coincidence that the partial American disengagement with the continent coincides today with a crisis in relations between Germany and France? Washington seems increasingly distant. Old wounds resurface, never fully healed. In particular, the origin of tensions between the two banks of the Rhine lies in an opposing perception of German rearmament. Paris fears that the Federal Republic could transform into an assertive power unrelated to any control. Berlin, for its part, suspects that the French intend to use German funds to further their expensive ambitions. This is a structural fracture, impossible to completely bridge, regardless of the good will of Merz and Macron.

This is an initiative organized by the Cultural Institute (IC) and brings together the work of eight artists from China and Portuguese-speaking countries, namely Cao Yu and Tong Wenmin, from Mainland China; Wong Hio Chit and Cosmo Wong from Macau, China; Carla Cabanas, from Portugal; Délio Jasse, from Angola; Eugénia Mussa, from Mozambique; and Juliana Matsumura, from Brazil.
The exhibition presents works in different media, covering painting, sculpture, video and installation, revealing a mosaic of the cultural contexts of China and Portuguese-speaking Countries, “expressed through a rich artistic vocabulary”, highlights the IC, in a note.
Curatorial notes
To organize this exhibition and its content, the curators based themselves on “the experience of two legendary travelers from the 16th century, one from the West and the other from the East: the Portuguese Fernão Mendes Pinto and the Chinese Xu Xiake”, both of whom, according to the IC, “measured the world with their own steps, transforming their observations and travel experiences into philosophical reflections on life”.
The exhibition “uses artistic creation in place of physical travel, offering visitors a visual feast through 28 pieces/sets of works in various media”. The possible visitor experience is described, which could be similar to “following in the footsteps of a traveler, starting an artistic tour of self-reflection and exploration of the world”.
This exhibition can be visited until March 1st of next year, between 10am and 7pm, free of charge. During this month, guided tours will be available in Cantonese and Mandarin, respectively at 3pm and 4pm, every Saturday, Sunday and public holiday, as well as on the 23rd and 26th.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:53:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Consulate | “Camões Cinco Zero Zero”, by Vítor Marreiros, travels from Lisbon to Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/consulado-camoes-cinco-zero-zero-de-vitor-marreiros-viaja-de-lisboa-para-macau/</link><description>After a period on display at the Passevite gallery, in Lisbon, the exhibition “Camões Cinco Zero Zero” now arrives at Macao SAR. It is a set of works by designer and artist Vítor Marreiros, which presents visions and interpretations of the great poet of the Portuguese language. To see until the 27th, at the Consulate of Portugal
It is entitled “Camões Cinco Zero Zero” and was held in Lisbon in the summer as the first exhibition by Vítor Marreiros presented, individually, in Portugal. At the Passevite gallery, the work of this Macanese designer and artist who regularly makes posters commemorating the 10th of June for the Casa de Portugal in Macau was revealed to the Portuguese public.
Thus, on the walls of this independent gallery, images of Luís de Camões were gathered, taken from posters, and adorned with new guises and interpretations.
The exhibition now travels to Macau, almost in a return to its origins, being exhibited thanks to the initiative of the Consulate-General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong and the Instituto Português do Oriente, until the 27th of December. The inauguration takes place tomorrow, starting at 6:30 pm, and the exhibition can be visited daily between 3:30 pm and 6:30 pm, specifically in the Gallery of the Official Residence of the Consul General, on Rua do Comendador Kou Hó Neng.
According to a note from the Consulate, “the exhibition marks the 500th anniversary of the birth of Luís de Camões, based on an original idea by designer Henrique Silva (Bibito), proposing a contemporary and symbolic reading of the poet's figure through the posters that Victor Marreiros has created over more than three decades to celebrate the 10th of June in Macau”.
Camões appears here “removed from its usual context” and “reinterpreted with graphic freedom, humor and critical spirit, in a series that is, simultaneously, memory and creation”.
This “symbolically closes the cycle of a project that unites the two margins of Portuguese heritage and celebrates the dialogue between art, history and identity”. During the exhibition period, a special silkscreen edition numbered and signed by the artist will be available, as well as the official exhibition catalogue.
Contemporary themes
In Lisbon, HM spoke with Vítor Hugo Marreiros, who spoke about his long connection with Camões, through drawing and imagination, and the work he has been doing for several years with the posters that celebrate such an important date for Portugal.
“It all came from the challenge proposed by a colleague of mine, Henrique Silva, better known as Bibito”, he told HM. “The paintings here are not only taken from the 10th of June posters, but also from other works, because throughout my professional life I have had countless opportunities to portray Portuguese themes and icons such as Fernando Pessoa, Amália, even the sardine”, he said.
There are 34 years of posters and figures that portray Portugal and the themes of this community. Around Vítor Marreiros’ images there is not only literature, but also more contemporary issues.
"In recent years I have tried to portray the concerns of the Portuguese community [of Macau], as well as events in Portugal, the crisis, Covid-19 or the war in Ukraine. Camões speaks for itself, in different years and always accompanied by the events of the year. Sometimes I have Camões speak for me. My partner always tells me that, and I have Camões say what I want."</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:51:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Government highlights calendar with nighttime activities this month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/02/governo-destaca-calendario-com-actividades-nocturnas-este-mes/</link><description>The Directorate of Tourism Services (DST) highlights that this month will be marked by the holding of several night programs, many of them already in the Christmas spirit, and integrated into the subsidies program for associations with a view to diversifying tourist activity.

However, the HIV virus is still present and it is with this problem in mind that Macau hosts this weekend, at the Grand Lisboa Palace, the 8th Forum on AIDS in Beijing, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, organized by a local association
The Macao AIDS Care Association is promoting, this Saturday and Sunday, the 8th Beijing, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan AIDS Forum, taking place at Lisboeta Macau, in Cotai. This is an event that aims to draw attention to a pathology that evolved into a chronic disease due to the scourge of deaths it caused in the 1980s, but which continues to be present and alert authorities around the world.
According to a statement sent by the association, the aim is to “bring together renowned experts to discuss critical issues of HIV prevention, treatment and social support”. The event aims to cover topics such as “the public health strategy”, namely “the latest developments in policies and technologies related to HIV, including the application of artificial intelligence”, or even “social issues”, such as “important discussions on eliminating stigma and supporting elderly populations living with HIV”.
Other topics on the agenda relate to the “local impact”, namely “Macau’s role as host and collaborator in this important inter-regional dialogue”.
Fight stigma
The conference's theme is “Together wih Love, Not Alone in the Fight” and has the support of entities such as The Home of Red Ribbon, Hong Kong Aids Foundation and Macau Association for Gender Diverse Community, which, as the name suggests, draws attention to gender equality.
The description of the event states that “medical advances have not been accompanied by a proportionate level of understanding and social acceptance”, with “stigma, discrimination and social isolation [which are] deeply rooted” remaining” and which “continue to cause a great psychological impact and lead to systemic marginalization, preventing many people from accessing equitable care and living with dignity”.
There is, therefore, a “critical gap between medical progress and the delay in social support”, which this forum aims to provide answers to. “We focus on two objectives, ‘Eliminating Stigma’ and ‘Building Robust Support Systems’, translating scientific knowledge into tangible and inclusive social practices”, it is described.
One of the speakers comes from Italy, namely from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. Giovanni Guaraldi will speak, on the first day, about “Person-centered approach to HIV care: Why does it matter and how to make it happen?”.
growing
The most recent HIV data in Macau, released in November by the Health Services, speaks of a growing trend: between January and September this year, 28 new cases of HIV infection were registered, 14 of which were among residents and 14 among non-residents.
In comparison, between January and September last year, nine cases had been confirmed among residents, which means that throughout this year there has been a 55.6 percent increase in new cases. In last year's statement, there was no reference to infected non-residents.
“Among the new cases confirmed in Macau residents, all are male, with 50 percent aged between 18 and 39 years old and 50 percent aged 40 or over”, the authorities reported.
Of these cases, 13 of the infections were contracted through homosexual or bisexual intercourse, while one of the cases indicated that it resulted from heterosexual sexual intercourse. “All new cases were referred to the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário for monitoring and, currently, the treatment and control rate for Macau residents exceeds 90 percent”, it was added.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:49:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Satellite Casinos | Kam Pek closed its doors</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/casinos-satelite-kam-pek-fechou-as-portas/</link><description>The Kam Pek Paradise casino, linked to the concessionaire SJM Resorts, closed its doors at 11:31 pm on Monday.

The number of workers affected by layoffs was not communicated by the DICJ, which also did not make reference to the number of workers who will be transferred to SJM Resorts.
In July this year, when it was confirmed that the Kam Pek Paradise casino was going to close, the news caused surprise among analysts. A statement from CLSA that month indicated that the closure was unexpected, given that the casino was run at a profit.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:48:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Metro | Daily average of 32,600 passengers in November</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/metro-media-diaria-de-32-600-passageiros-em-novembro/</link><description>In November, the Light Rail transported around 32,600 passengers per day, a new record since trips began to be paid.

Transactions fell 18.6 percent, while prices fell 9.1 percent. The usable area of ​​properties sold also decreased by more than 10 percent annually.
The residential property market continued to fall in the first half of November. According to data released yesterday by the Financial Services Directorate, in the first half of November, 118 housing units were sold in the territory, 27 fewer compared to the same period last year, or a reduction of 18.6 percent.
Statistical data based on stamp duty for the transfer of goods also reveals that the average price per square meter followed a downward trend, with a drop of 9.1 percent, to 66,315 patacas. Even the usable area of ​​sold homes decreased by 10.1 percent to 71 square meters
In the period under review, the biggest drops in sales and prices occurred in Taipa, with a total of 21 houses sold, 15 fewer compared to the first half of November 2024, representing a drop of 41.7 percent. Residential property prices in Taipa also fell by 10.2 percent, reaching an average of MOP64,510 per square meter.
On the peninsula, where 90 of the total 118 units were sold, transactions recorded a decrease of 11.8 percent. The price also decreased from 72,613 patacas per square meter to 66,476 patacas per square meter, that is, 8.4 percent less. In the most expensive market (Coloane) seven properties were sold in the first half of November, the same number in annual terms. However, the price per square meter fell 10 percent to 75,946 patacas.
Closer in time
In monthly terms, property values ​​follow the same trend, despite the greater number of sales driven by the peninsula market.
In total, house sales increased in the first half of November, compared to the same period in October, by 3.5 percent, going from 114 transactions to 118, with the market “heating up” slightly on the peninsula with an increase of 9.7 percent. This is not surprising, given that the peninsula was the area of ​​Macau where prices fell the most in monthly terms: 13.4 percent.
In Taipa, sales were maintained (11) and prices rose 5.5 percent, but in Coloane the monthly drop in sales was more severe (-36.4 percent), despite the drop in square meter prices of 11.3 percent. Taking the entire territory of Macau into account, prices suffered a negative monthly variation of 9.9 percent, falling from 73,632 patacas to 66,315 patacas per square meter.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:45:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Accident | Drunk man drove in the opposite direction</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/acidente-homem-alcoolizado-conduziu-em-sentido-contrario/</link><description>In the early hours of Saturday, November 29th, an accident occurred with a drunk resident who drove in the opposite direction. According to the newspaper Ou Mun, the accident, which occurred around 1:55 am, culminated in a collision with another car that was parked in a space with a parking meter.
The drunk man ended up admitting to the authorities that he had consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, having recorded 1.73 grams per liter of blood. The resident, aged around 30, declared that he was a bar employee, having had dinner at a restaurant on Saturday night at around 10pm, in the Avenida Horta e Costa area, where after consuming alcohol, he drove the car around 1:45am.
At the intersection between Avenida do Almirante Lacerda and Avenida de Horta e Costa, the man drove in the opposite direction, and after realizing the infraction he reversed to return to the correct lane. Near Estrada do Campo, he collided with a car that was parked there. The Public Security Police used images from video surveillance cameras to understand what had happened, confirming the statement. The owner of the affected vehicle was contacted and the damage is still being investigated.
The case was, however, referred to the Public Prosecutor's Office for further investigation, with the driver being charged with the crime of driving under the influence of alcohol, aggravated by driving in the opposite direction and causing a traffic accident.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:43:40</pubDate></item><item><title>ZELENSKY VS ZELENSKY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.
 
10/28/22
At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke at length and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. It says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no such thing as chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is usually used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in others. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this mistake. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who didn't love anyone./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria stayed with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely outside our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J.

When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but this only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows everyone else and the joy of recognizing that the yardstick of the world is not measured with my short measure and that, on the contrary, it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican for writers from the north, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thought about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché “all different, all equal”, a return to “diplomacy”, given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that “we are unified because we share the same nature” but simply highlights that we “still do not share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that quenches your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and impressive, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unresponsive to reins and containment.
Let men refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish, because of it the tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the pride of the countries will be destroyed.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert”.
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that muzzle, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relationships were restricted, or if it merely lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Obviously, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as a hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, in a different way, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE
(…)
Helahoho! helahoho!
The poor widow's sewing machine who was bayoneted...
She sewed indefinitely in the afternoon…
The table where the old people played,
Everything mixed, everything mixed with bodies, with blood,
All one river, one wave, one dragging horror.
Helahoho! helahoho!
I unearthed the child's tin train pressed into the middle of the
[road,
And I cried like all the mothers in the world about the horror of life.
My pantheistic feet tripped over the sewing machine
[widow who was killed with a bayonet
And that poor instrument of peace stuck a spear in my heart.
Yes, I was the one to blame for everything, I was the soldier for them all
Who killed, raped, burned and broke,
It was me and my shame and my remorse like a shadow
[deformed
They travel around the world like Ashavero,
But behind my steps there are footsteps the size of infinity
And a physical fear of being accountable to God makes me close my eyes.
[eyes suddenly.
(…)
I ordered, captain, to shoot the trembling peasants,
I let the daughters of all fathers tied to trees be raped,
Now I saw that it was inside my heart that all this happened,
And everything scalds and suffocates and I can't move without it
[everything be the same.
God have mercy on me, I didn't have it from anyone!
LÀ-BAS, JE NE SAIS OÙ…”
What is clear today, at this disastrous moment in which Cristiano &amp; Companhia failed in their mission in Braga, and in which the self-sabotage of Russia's gas pipelines reminds us that Putin will be willing to do anything to maintain dominance over the areas endorsed,
is that, bomb for bomb, the “bomb” of the Fifth Empire was preferable.
However, even in this, my dears, we were irresolute, a little more on the side of piella than determined, and we procrastinated.</description><pubDate>2022-09-29 02:34:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese coast guard expels Japanese boat from Tokyo-controlled islands</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/guarda-costeira-chinesa-expulsa-barco-japones-de-ilhas-controladas-por-toquio/</link><description>China's coast guard yesterday expelled a Japanese fishing vessel that, according to Chinese authorities, had illegally entered waters near the Diaoyu islands, controlled by Japan but disputed by other countries.
The Chinese Coast Guard indicated in a statement published on the WeChat platform that it “took the necessary control measures in accordance with the law”. Spokesman Liu Dejun said the Coast Guard ordered the Japanese vessel Zuiho-maru to move away from the area, reiterating that the archipelago, known as Diaoyu in China, constitutes "China's inherent territory."
Liu also urged Japan to “immediately cease all infringing and provocative activities” in the area and assured that the Coast Guard will continue to carry out “law enforcement operations to defend the rights” of China.
In recent years, Beijing has given its coast guard new capabilities, including the authority to detain foreign vessels suspected of illegally entering territorial waters, amid rising territorial tensions with U.S. allies such as Japan and the Philippines. The Chinese Coast Guard has also substantially strengthened operational capacity, thanks to the allocation of more ships and increased logistical support.
Located in the East China Sea, about 150 kilometers northeast of Taiwan, the uninhabited Diaoyu Islands cover an area of ​​approximately seven square kilometers, and it is believed that there may be important deposits of gas or oil in the adjacent waters.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 08:11:29</pubDate></item><item><title>A third of EU companies in China consider diverting production in the face of restrictions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/um-terco-das-empresas-da-ue-na-china-pondera-desviar-producao-face-a-restricoes/</link><description>More than a third of European companies in China are considering diverting part of the supply chain outside the Asian country, to mitigate the impact of export controls implemented by Beijing.
According to a survey released on Monday by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, 36 percent of companies are considering developing supply capacity outside China and 32 percent plan to obtain inputs from other markets, while 43 percent have not yet made a strategic decision.
The survey, carried out between 6 and 24 November with responses from 131 companies, reveals that the majority have already been affected or expect to be affected by Chinese measures, which cover rare earth minerals, lithium battery technologies, super-hard materials and extraterritorial controls on products that incorporate components processed in China.
According to the report, the most immediate impact is on delivery times: 40 percent of respondents indicated that approval procedures added more than two months to supply times, while another 34 percent reported delays of between one and two months. The difficulties center on the process of applying for an export license with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.
Nearly 40 percent complained about a lack of transparency, 21 percent found the requirements unclear, and 40 percent said requests exceeded the official 45-day processing limit set by authorities. Some companies have expressed concern about the amount of sensitive information they must provide, including intellectual property.
Other complications
The problems don't end after the license is granted: 42 percent reported additional customs delays and 26 percent said the obstacles added a week or more to the shipment of previously authorized goods. Supply disruptions are affecting both exporters with factories in China and European producers who depend on Chinese parts or equipment.
The document states that 60 percent foresee “moderate or significant” interruptions if all announced controls are fully implemented, and 13 percent fear total production interruptions. Chamber President Jens Eskelund warns that Chinese authorities have “added uncertainty” to the operations of European companies, coinciding with a period of trade friction between Beijing and Brussels.
The institution's vice-president, Stefan Bernhart, recommended the establishment of a “general licensing system” in the short term, which would provide “much-needed stability and predictability”. In April, Beijing imposed restrictions on several categories of rare earth elements and derivatives, which led some European companies to temporarily halt their production lines.
Despite the partial suspension of certain measures following the November summit between China and the United States, part of the control regime remains active and continues to affect supply chains.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 08:05:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Meeting | Moscow and Beijing condemn resurgence of “criminal regimes” in Europe and Japan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/encontro-moscovo-e-pequim-condenam-ressurgimento-de-regimes-criminosos-na-europa-e-japao/</link><description>The secretary of the Russian Security Council, Sergei Shoigu, said yesterday that Moscow and Beijing will not allow the resurgence of what he called “criminal regimes” in Europe and Japan. Shoigu's statements came after a meeting in Moscow between the secretary of the Russian Security Council and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Wang Yi.
The meeting between Shoigu and Wang Yi marked the twentieth round of Russian-Chinese consultations on strategic stability. Shoigu said, quoted by the TASS news agency, that “the hydra of militarism is raising its head again”. The Russian official added that, in this sense, Moscow and Beijing have accumulated enough experience to stop militaristic impulses and that they will not allow the resurgence of what he classified as “criminal regimes in Europe and Tokyo”.
The former Russian Defense Minister also said that Beijing considered attempts to falsify history unacceptable. “This is especially important given the growing desire for revenge in some European countries and Japan for past defeats,” Shoigu said.
Wang Yi stressed that Russia and the People's Republic of China are two countries united against any attempt that could contradict the historical truth. For the Chinese Foreign Minister “it is necessary to be vigilant” and reject attempts to revive militarism and fascism in Japan.
Shoigu reaffirmed what he said was Moscow's consistent and unwavering support for Beijing on Taiwan issues, and on the regions of Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. For Moscow, Shoigu said, the government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate power and represents all of China.
Serguei Shoigu highlighted that Russian-Chinese coordination in the area of ​​strategic security plays a “crucial stabilizing role” and that it helps to shape a fairer world order, preventing the privileged positions of “certain countries”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 08:03:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong bans political organizations based abroad</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/hong-kong-proibe-organizacoes-politicas-radicadas-no-estrangeiro/</link><description>Hong Kong authorities yesterday declared two political entities in exile as “prohibited organizations” – the self-styled Hong Kong Parliament, based in Canada, and the Hong Kong Union for Democratic Independence, based in Taiwan. The measure – the first of its kind against groups operating abroad, framed in the National Security Law – was published on Monday in the official gazette and came into force immediately.
According to the office of Hong Kong Security Secretary Chris Tang, on November 25, formal requests were sent to both formations with a seven-day deadline to present allegations. The Hong Kong Parliament responded in writing, but the Taiwanese entity remained silent.
After analyzing the documentation received and the background, Tang considered the need to veto them proven, in order to preserve national sovereignty.
The Executive accuses both groups of carrying out “subversive activities”, aimed at “overthrowing the power of the State”, by promoting self-determination, drafting an alternative constitution and weakening the constitutional order of the People's Republic of China.
The decision determines that any person who exercises management functions, maintains membership, organizes meetings, facilitates funds or provides any type of collaboration to the two entities will incur a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison and a fine of one million Hong Kong dollars. At a hearing yesterday, Tang confirmed the procedure followed and recalled recent convictions related to both groups.
A 19-year-old activist was sentenced to 12 months in prison for sedition after admitting to having posted videos on social media that encouraged participation in the elections for the Parliament in exile, created with the aim of establishing a parallel legislative branch to overthrow the local government.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>HK | Independent fire investigation announced and elections held</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/03/hk-anunciada-investigacao-independente-a-incendio-e-mantidas-eleicoes/</link><description>While searches continue to find 40 people still missing, authorities announced the opening of an investigation aimed at finding out all the causes of the tragedy in Tai Po that left at least 151 dead. Sunday, there are elections
The Hong Kong Government yesterday announced an independent investigation to investigate the causes of the fire that killed at least 151 people, in addition to indicating that the legislative elections “will be held as scheduled” on Sunday.
The Chief Executive of Hong Kong, John Lee Ka-chiu, announced the creation of an independent commission, chaired by a judge, to investigate “to the end” the fire that broke out on Wednesday in the Wang Fuk Court residential complex, in the north of the semi-autonomous region, while the search continues for almost 40 missing people.
This commission will determine, in agreement with the director, the causes of the incident and propose structural changes. “Those guilty will be held accountable regardless of their position”, he assured.
The fire has already led to the arrest of more than a dozen people for alleged negligent homicide, in an investigation that points to irregularities in the maintenance work that was underway at the public housing complex.
Expert examinations carried out on 20 samples of netting used outdoors, collected at different times, detected that seven of them did not meet fire resistance standards. The approved material was only installed on the ground floors to avoid controls following the passage of super typhoon Ragasa in July.
At the same time, at least three people have been detained since Saturday for alleged violations against national security: a 22-year-old university student who launched a petition with more than 10,000 signatures calling for an independent investigation, former district councilor Kenneth Cheung and a volunteer, all accused of “exploiting the tragedy to incite hatred and create instability”. The national security protection office warned that this type of behavior “will be punished mercilessly”.
Maintain order
Before the weekly meeting of the Executive Council, John Lee also stated that future deputies of the Legislative Council (LegCo, the local parliament) will be “fundamental partners” in supervising the allocation of public funds and reviewing policies to avoid new catastrophes in Hong Kong, a city neighboring Macau.
Maintaining the date of the legislative elections, which the Government considered postponing, “is respecting the constitutional order and the rule of law”, insisted the government official, before warning that “any attempt at sabotage or political exploitation of the tragedy will be vigorously pursued”.
"We need to build a better Hong Kong. Justice will be served. It is a tragedy, yes, we need reform, we have identified the flaws, we must act firmly to hold those responsible to account, we will reform the entire building rehabilitation system, we will do everything possible", he said. The leader also pointed out that “fires happen in all cities and that Hong Kong will do everything to avoid them”.
Of the 90 seats in the LegCo, only 20 are elected by direct universal suffrage in geographic constituencies (51 candidates), 30 are elected by different sectors of activity (60 candidates) and the remaining 40 are designated by an electoral college (50 candidates), a body whose 1,500 members are, in the majority, Beijing supporters.</description><pubDate>2025-12-03 07:55:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Taiwan CSBC Corp | Company misses submarine delivery deadline</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/02/taiwan-csbc-corp-empresa-falha-prazo-de-entrega-de-submarino/</link><description>Taiwanese shipbuilder CSBC Corp failed to meet the deadline set for the completion of the first locally designed submarine, Taiwanese Defense Minister Wellington Koo Li-hsiung said yesterday. The initial objective stipulated that the conclusion of the submarine's sea tests should have taken place before September 30 and the ship's delivery should be formalized by the end of November, according to the Taiwanese navy.
Wellington Koo announced yesterday in parliament that the tests, which began in June, are still ongoing. “I would like to emphasize once again that everything we do is based on security assessments and that there is no urgency in meeting a specific deadline”, said the official.
Koo had already admitted in October that the construction schedule was unrealistic, highlighting “equipment problems and delays in planning by manufacturers' technical personnel”. The submarine, whose construction is linked to a program launched in 2016, measures 80 meters in length and is equipped with combat systems and torpedoes supplied by the North American group Lockheed Martin.
The main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), and its ally, the Taiwan People's Party (PPT), which together control parliament, froze part of the program's budget at the beginning of the year, demanding to know the results of the submarine's sea trials before unlocking the funds.
The Taiwanese navy currently has two Swordfish-class submarines in service, acquired from the Netherlands in the 1980s. The Taiwanese government announced last week that it will propose $40 billion in additional defense spending over the coming years.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 05:19:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Chinese exports to PLP rise 0.9% until October</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/02/exportacoes-chinesas-para-plp-sobem-09-ate-outubro/</link><description>Chinese exports to Portuguese-speaking countries (PLP) rose 0.9 percent in the first ten months of 2025, compared to the same period last year, according to official data released yesterday.
According to information from the Chinese Customs Service, goods sold to Portuguese-speaking markets until October reached US$72.6 billion. This value represents an increase of 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2024, the year in which Chinese exports to the countries set a new record: 85.5 billion dollars.
Data compiled and released by the Forum for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries (Macao Forum) reveal that Angola was the main reason for the rise. Chinese goods sold to Angola reached US$4.04 billion by October, a year-on-year increase of more than half (51.1 percent).
Despite a year-on-year decline of 2.9 percent, Brazil continues to be the largest buyer in the Portuguese-speaking bloc, having purchased products worth US$59 billion from China. Second on the list – and in the opposite direction – comes Portugal, whose imports from China increased 14.8 percent to 5.88 billion dollars.
In the opposite direction, PLP exports to China fell 5.9 percent to $112.2 billion in the first ten months.
According to official data, this is the lowest value for the period between January and October since 2020, at the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic.
The decline was mainly due to Brazil – by far the largest Portuguese-speaking supplier in the Chinese market – whose sales fell 4.7 percent to US$94.9 billion.
Furthermore, the second largest Chinese trading partner in the Portuguese-speaking bloc, Angola, saw exports fall 12.8 percent, to US$12.9 billion.
Descending route
Sales of goods from Portugal to China decreased by 7.6 percent, compared to the first ten months of 2024, to US$2.39 billion. In fact, six of the nine Portuguese-speaking countries reduced exports to the Chinese market. Mozambique's sales to the Chinese market fell 8 percent, to US$1.35 billion, while Equatorial Guinea's exports shrank 28.5 percent, to US$634.3 million.
Cape Verde's remittances decreased by 37.1 percent, with the country selling only around eight thousand dollars worth of goods to China between January and October. Timor-Leste stood out on a positive note, with exports to China rising from just 632 thousand dollars to 26.8 million dollars in the space of a year.
Sales from São Tomé and Príncipe also grew nine times, to 51 thousand dollars, while the value of exports from Guinea-Bissau went from zero to eight thousand dollars. China continues to record a trade deficit with the Portuguese-speaking bloc, which reached US$39.6 billion in the first ten months of 2025.
In total, trade between Portuguese-speaking countries and China reached US$184.8 billion, 3.4 percent less than in the same period last year.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 05:16:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Army | Military discipline tightens after purges and corruption cases</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/02/exercito-endurecida-disciplina-militar-apos-purgas-e-casos-de-corrupcao/</link><description>Military authorities announced that the new disciplinary rules will come into force in 2026
China's Central Military Commission yesterday approved new disciplinary provisions that tighten political control, punish disobedience to strategic orders and punish falsifications in the assessment of combat capability. The regulatory review comes into force in 2026 and comes after a year of purges, in which high-ranking officials, including a former vice-president of the body, were expelled on suspicion of corruption.
The Daily People's Liberation Army (PLA, Chinese Army) announced through its Wechat platform account that the supplementary provisions update the internal framework for implementing the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) disciplinary regulations in the Armed Forces. The military publication does not provide the full text of the regulatory changes, nor does it detail specific cases that motivated them.
According to the official note, the new rules place “political discipline” as an absolute priority and include sanctions for “inappropriate comments”, failures in the application of the responsibility system of the chairman of the Central Military Commission, Xi Jinping, and deficiencies in the execution of orders.
The document also mentions measures against irregularities in sensitive areas, such as hiring, promotions, profitable activities and use of resources, as well as conduct ranging from inappropriate banquets to formalism and bureaucracy.
Another highlighted novelty is the reinforcement of controls related to combat preparation, with special attention to the manipulation of data in assessments of military capacity, an aspect about which Beijing did not offer concrete examples, but which has been the target of internal criticism in recent months.
Stronger
The Central Military Commission maintains that the new disciplinary package aims to “give strength” to existing norms, although, for now, the full content of the statement nor the scope of the expected sanctions have been published.
The review comes in a context of exceptional scrutiny on the EPL. In October, authorities expelled nine senior commanders from the Party and Army, including General He Weidong, former vice-president of the Central Military Commission, and Admiral Miao Hua, both of whom were being investigated on suspicion of corruption.
The Rocket Force, responsible for the nuclear arsenal, was especially affected by sanctions and suspensions of experts and suppliers, after irregularities in the hiring processes were detected. Since 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping has been advocating the intensification of “self-revolution” within the armed forces and the link between internal cleansing and combat capacity.
Recent articles in the military press have called on cadres to “tell the truth” and avoid cover-ups, alongside guidelines aimed at restricting informal networks of influence.</description><pubDate>2025-12-02 05:15:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong fire death toll rises to 151</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/01/numero-de-mortos-no-incendio-em-hong-kong-sobe-para-151/</link><description>The number of confirmed deaths in the fire that devastated a residential complex in Hong Kong last week has risen to 151 and the toll could still rise, police revealed today.

Chan Tung, director of Hong Kong's criminal and security police, told the press that an "in-depth investigation was immediately opened for culpable homicide", which "led to the arrest of 13 people, 12 men and one woman".
The fire broke out at around 3pm on Wednesday (7am in Lisbon) in the Wang Cheong House block and affected seven of the eight buildings. Preliminary investigations indicate that the fire originated in the scaffolding protection network on the lower floors and spread quickly vertically.
Highly flammable expanded polystyrene sheets, used to seal the openings and frames near the elevators, as well as the exterior tarpaulins that violated fire safety standards, made it easier for the flames to enter the apartments through the corridors.
Since Wednesday night, thousands of citizens, neighborhood groups, unions, churches and volunteers have mobilized spontaneously, raising millions of Hong Kong dollars and distributing water, food, clothing and temporary shelter.
The Government announced an initial fund of 300 million Hong Kong dollars to help victims and affected people, which has now reached 800 million Hong Kong dollars.</description><pubDate>2025-12-01 18:11:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Luís Bernardino, academic: “We need to define a defense cooperation strategy” for the CPLP</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/25/luis-bernardino-academico-precisamos-definir-uma-estrategia-de-cooperacao-defesa-para-a-cplp/</link><description>The book “25 Years of Defense Cooperation at CPLP” was released in 2023 in digital format and, two years later, reached the printed version. Luís Bernardino, co-author linked to the Universidade Autónoma de Lisboa, highlights positive developments since the creation of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, despite inaction and controversies with Equatorial Guinea
“25 Years of Defense Cooperation in the CPLP [Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries]” was released as an e-book and is now available in print. Why edit this book?
This book talks about the 25 years of cooperation in the CPLP defense area and is written by me, together with a colleague from Brazil, Camila Rizzi. It results from a research project developed at the CPLP Strategic Analysis Center, based in Mozambique. It has the CPLP defense component and makes strategic reflection on this topic. Due to the fact that 25 years of cooperation have passed in this area, we wanted to carry out an evaluation and the book so that it would remain in the history of the organization. In 2023, there were no financial conditions to publish the book on paper as we wanted, and it was now launched on November 18th, in Maputo.
There is criticism regarding the effective action of the CPLP. Do you consider that this organism has grown sustainably?
The assessment I make is in the area of ​​defense. When the CPLP was created, cooperation in the area of ​​defense was not included in the initial six areas. This area only emerged in 1998. The CPLP was born with six main areas – culture, language, political-diplomatic concentration – and currently has 26 areas of cooperation, which is proof that it has grown in a sustained manner. Obviously, with ups and downs, situations have become easier over these almost 30 years. But what stands out in this book, in the area of ​​defense, is that there was a very consolidated and participated growth. In these 25 years, a lot of interesting things have been done and the evaluation is positive.
And the future?
We need to define a defense cooperation strategy and what we want for the CPLP in this area over the next 25 years. This is the challenge we face, of greater activity and initiative, so that cooperation and defense can be strategic in what is cooperation within States. So that it can be more visible and effectively allow for growth, participation and development, or even greater commitment, in regional contexts.
But looking at the past, present and future, what has the dynamic been like in the defense area?
The book shows a certain dynamic of substantial constitutional growth in the first phase. Then there were very interesting developments, with some protocols and cooperation at the level of the Armed Forces, but there is still a lot to do, namely looking at the area of ​​defense cooperation as a strategic area.
The global geopolitical system appears to be changing very quickly, following a multipolar path. Should the CPLP have another role in this context, with actors such as China, Russia or the United States?
The CPLP is not a multilateral instrument, it is not an organization of that level. We have to place the CPLP at the level of the Commonwealth, for example, of organizations at a cultural, linguistic level, of partnership between countries, of concern for development. What I usually say is that the CPLP is a good diplomatic communication instrument, a soft power in areas related to conflict management and prevention. Let us not expect there to be armed forces, or an army, from the CPLP. This body is one of dialogue and cooperation. What we do, in terms of defense, is exactly that, create partnerships so that there are mechanisms for responding to disasters, to provide training capacity for the armed forces. There are even those who ask the question: why did the CPLP not intervene in Cabo Delgado, in Mozambique, on the issue of terrorism?
And why?
Because the CPLP is not a hard power mechanism, it has no capacity, doctrine, logistics, mandate or viability to be used in combat operations. And CPLP Member States are very aware that we are a very good mechanism for cooperation, partnership and development, with contributions to culture and language. Therefore, the CPLP will not intervene in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, because that is not its area, nor does it have mechanisms for this dynamic.
Is the existence of the CPLP justified?
I think so, obviously, because, as I said, the CPLP is a very good instrument in terms of cooperation, the dissemination of the Portuguese language, of history. The fact is that we have around 350 million people who speak Portuguese. We have 30 countries that are associated observers, such as Ukraine, Chile, and Portuguese culture is represented in this organization. Each country has what it wants from the CPLP and gives it the importance it thinks it should give, and this depends on the foreign policy of each State. But I think the CPLP makes a lot of sense in the world we live in, and does so as a multilateral representative of language, culture, cooperation between Portuguese-speaking states, and those that ultimately have some affinity [with the Portuguese-speaking world]. The Macau issue is very specific to this organization.
Macau has the role of a commercial platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, and China has an agenda for Lusophony.
Before 1999 Macau had its own status within the CPLP, as it was administered by Portuguese. There was a Joint Declaration that allowed Macau, not being a Member State, to have, in a certain way, a protocol [with the CPLP]. When it became a Macao SAR, things changed and it lost that connection status, and Macau is not a member of the CPLP, and obviously cannot be. Neither does China, and it cannot be. Therefore, there is an associated observer status here that arises for countries, international and regional organizations, and even territorial entities with their own administration, which is also not quite the case in Macau. The territory is in limbo, between having a very strong history linked to Lusofonia, and having an administration very linked to China, which gives it, in my perspective, two dynamics.
In what sense?
Macau is a fundamental element in the connection between the CPLP countries and China. For all reasons, but due to the issue of language, history, and its representation, it is a fundamental actor in this cooperation. Macau must effectively be seen as a partner and as a gateway for China to Portuguese-speaking countries. This is what, in a way, is already happening, and this is what the CPLP will be paying attention to, in this relationship in which Macau has a special status. Whether we like it or not, it has an impact. Macau is an attractive factor in facilitating relations between China and Angola, Portugal or Brazil.
Does Equatorial Guinea's stay in the CPLP raise questions of credibility?
I agree with you. In these 30 years, it has been one of the main difficult moments in creating consensus. I remember that Equatorial Guinea was admitted in 2014, but there was already a process in the previous analysis phase. There was always an extension, year after year, and it was difficult to reach a consensus within the CPLP countries. In 2014, there was a summit in Timor-Leste and, through the action of Brazil and Angola, there was, in a way, a lot of pressure for Equatorial Guinea to join. But there are two principles, for better and for worse, that justify Equatorial Guinea's presence in the CPLP.
What are…
The first argument is that, in fact, Equatorial Guinea has Portuguese as its official language in its Constitution, despite us knowing that the Portuguese language, for example, covers four or five percent of society as a whole, and I am already being quite generous. But there is a commitment from the Equatorial Guinea authorities to develop Portuguese as a working language and there is a historical connection to Portuguese culture and Lusophony. Another criterion is the promise that, in the next constitutional review, a commitment will be made to abolish the death penalty. As for Portuguese, it's something that takes generations, it's not done from one year to the next. Not even in the next 10 or 15 years will we have Portuguese perfectly implemented. There is some shyness, a commitment, in a way. As for the death penalty, the fact is that, it seems, some change has been achieved. There has never been a death penalty action again [since accession]. And there is hope that, in the next constitutional review, this fact will be abolished from the Constitution and that it may, effectively, cease to exist. As a member of the CPLP, these changes will be easier and more visible and, in the future, Equatorial Guinea can effectively assume CPLP status taking these premises into account. I don't know if it will happen, I leave here a reluctance, and this is a challenging moment for the CPLP itself. Work needs to be done from within, so that Equatorial Guinea can be at the same level as other countries, especially in these two areas.
What is certain is that there remains a certain lack of transparency regarding what is happening in the country.
We are aware that Equatorial Guinea has major problems with issues of democratic legitimacy and elections. There are a series of situations that we recognize are not perfectly adequate given the status of CPLP countries. I think there is hope that things can change, an attempt to create space for Portuguese to grow within Equatorial Guinea, and also a commitment to greater openness and participation. What is a fact is that Equatorial Guinea has participated in CPLP meetings, and I have participated in some. In international situations we have to be pragmatic, and we hope that, just because Equatorial Guinea is in the CPLP, this can help Guinea itself to develop some mechanical gestures.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Timor-Leste / Independence – Mari Alkatiri: Proclamation was anticipated by the Indonesian military presence</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/24/timor-leste-independencia-mari-alkatiri-proclamacao-foi-antecipada-pela-presenca-militar-indonesia/</link><description>Interview by Isabel Marisa Serafim, from the Lusa agency
The leader of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin), Mari Alkatiri, said that the unilateral proclamation of independence was scheduled for December 1, 1975, but was brought forward because Indonesian troops were already in the territory.
“It was initially scheduled for December 1st”, said Mari Alkatiri, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which is marked on Friday, and of the Indonesian occupation, nine days later, on December 7th.
In November, Mari Alkatiri went on a “safari” through several African countries, mainly the Portuguese-speaking African Countries (PALOP), which involved participating in the declaration of Angola’s independence on November 11, 1975.
"After this 'tour', this African 'safari', I returned to the country. At the time I was in Maputo to prepare my return and I received a call from Nicolau Lobato not to return, because we needed to have someone outside the country", he recalled, highlighting that he did not follow the order from the then vice-president of Fretilin.
“So I returned to Dili on the 22nd or 23rd of November and the central committee and military political committee were meeting at the current headquarters of the National Police of Timor-Leste, which was the provisional headquarters of Fretilin, and the proclamation for December 1st was being discussed”, he explained. On November 28, Mari Alkatiri, then 25 years old, recalled that Nicolau Lobato came to her house and said that it was necessary to proclaim independence that day.
"We both left in his car for Lahane where Xavier do Amaral [former president of Fretilin] was and we conveyed this to Xavier Amaral, who clearly said to wait another three or four days. We said there was no time to wait and we decided to make the proclamation that day in the afternoon", he said.
"Fortunately, not only was the Constitution ready, but also the flag was ready. It was my mother who sewed the flag. There were minimum conditions for the proclamation of independence", stated the current secretary general of Fretilin, who also wrote the text of the proclamation.
“When I start talking about these days it’s not just memory, I actively participated in the unilateral proclamation of independence, although people try to cut out my photo, politics, but the truth is that there is only one person still alive who actively participated in the proclamation 50 years ago, that’s me”, he highlighted.
In the first Timorese Government, led by Nicolau Lobato and which only lasted nine days, Mari Alkatiri was appointed Minister of State for Political Affairs. Nocolau Lobato led the fight against the Indonesian occupation and was assassinated in December 1978. The restoration of independence took place on May 20, 2002, after a referendum for self-determination on August 30, 1999 and 24 years of resistance against Indonesia.
A question of egos
Mari Alkatiri also stated, in the same interview, that “egos” are preventing Timor-Leste from overcoming the challenges and that a more democratic, inclusive and comprehensive leadership culture is needed.
"If we managed it at the time, with all the difficulties, with all the challenges to overcome, at almost the speed of light, why can't we today? That's the question, the question of the cause. When the cause unites, the journey can go on, with many setbacks here and there, but we will succeed and we will win", said Mari Alkatiri in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which marks this Friday.
Asked about the reason for no union, the leader of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin) ​​said it was “egos”.
“I am following the budget debate, when we continue to think in a 'cantin' way about State matters, we are not going anywhere”, criticized the former East Timorese Prime Minister, whose party chose to abstain in the final global vote on the State Budget.
Regarding criticism of the current government's options, Mari Alkatiri said she did not know if there was ever an option. "I don't see a strategy. There are some successes here and there, tries here and there, but there is no strategy, but there is a lot of support for strategic planning, strategic investment, but I don't see it", he stated.
“There is a need for a much more democratic, much more inclusive, very comprehensive leadership culture, with a sense of mission and vision for the future”, highlighted the secretary general of Fretilin. The party leader also warned not to wait for the “bomb to explode”.
“The delay bomb is there, the time bomb is there, I hope we don’t have to, after that, apologize for the truth, after the bomb goes off”, he highlighted. Asked if the “bomb” is dissatisfaction, the former prime minister said: “complete”.
"A country that after 24 years of restoring independence, with the means it had to work, why did it fail? Lack of sense of inclusion. We are building a State, we talk about the Democratic Rule of Law, is that true? Or oligarchic", he asked.
The new generations
Still in relation to young people, who represent the majority of the approximately 1.4 million inhabitants of Timor-Leste, Mari Alkatiri said that they feel lost. "Young people are naturally more generous when they are more considered, or more rebellious, when they are revolted. There are two facets here in youth, one of generosity when they embrace a cause, the other is a much more violent reaction of confrontation", he said.
Pointing out that more than 70% of the population is under 35 years old, Mari Alkatiri warned that those “two generations have already been sacrificed” due to “poor quality” education and “increasingly worse health” and “no prospects”. “Now, we all say that oil money will run out, I see that for the Government, the alternative to oil is oil”, he said.
In September, the capital of the Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund was US$18.95 billion (€16.4 billion). “We kept dreaming about Sunrise and as I usually say while we dream about Sunrise, we will have the ‘sunset’, because there is no politics, there are no plans, there are no programs”, he added.
Mari Alkatiri was referring to the Greater Sunrise gas field, located 150 kilometers from Timor-Leste and 450 kilometers from Darwin, whose project has been mired in an impasse, with Dili defending the construction of a gas pipeline to the south of the country, and Woodside, the consortium's second largest partner, leaning towards a connection to the existing unit in Darwin.
The consortium is made up of the Timorese company Timor Gap (56.56%), the operator Woodside Energy (33.44%) and Osaca Gás (10.00%). The Government of Timor-Leste announced on Saturday the signing of a cooperation agreement with the Australian Woodside Energy for studies to process and export gas to the country.
Missing discussions
The secretary general of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin), Mari Alkatiri, defended the need for “all together” to discuss what failed in the last 24 years, after the restoration of independence in May 2002.
"There is a lot of talk about new paradigms and the old paradigm, we are ready to sit down together to discuss the old paradigm, why did it fail? No", said the former Timorese prime minister, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which marks this Friday.
For Mari Alkatiri, everyone contributed with “their positive part, with their negative part”, but it is necessary to understand the failures in “individual terms”, in “collective terms” and there be “responsibility”. Asked by Lusa about the reasons why there is no such discussion, the leader of the Timorese opposition replied that a “leader who cannot sit at the table is not a leader”.
"The leader must know that there is a time to sit at the table. I made proposals. When I returned in 2018, I said 'my vote is so that the people can win', I didn't say for Fretilin to win. The message was clear, it was time for us all to think together. I ran the campaign saying Fretilin wins, Xanana wins", stated Mari Alkatiri.
The Fretilin leader said the response has been “revenge, hate”. "In such a way that to take revenge on me, it affects hundreds of people, families. If it's me, come and talk to me, you don't have to harm others, but this is a specific issue", he stated, referring to the Timorese Prime Minister, XAnana Gusmão. The fundamental issue, continued Maria Alkatiri, is “to have a sense of mission, a vision of the future and to have a common cause”.
"What is crucial is knowing all the money that was spent, what was done. A balance of collective and individual performance. When we were waging war, we knew what we wanted, to restore independence, 24 years after the restoration of independence we don't know where we are going", lamented the leader.
Mari Alkatiri also said he was “very concerned” about the report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which warned on September 11 of the proliferation of criminal networks in Oecussi, a Timorese enclave on the Indonesian side of the island of Timor, highlighting that recent investigations show contamination of the region.
"It is already being absorbed by the mafia cartel, who are coming here in all their strength. We have closed kiosks and we think we are fighting the mafia. I am very worried," he said. For the future, Mari Alkatiri stated that he will continue to fight, but to “create critical mass”.
"My fight now is not the concern with electoral cycles, but how I can actually create a true critical mass in Timor-Leste. Let's end blindness, many of our academic intellectuals get pregnant through their ears, but they don't get pregnant", he highlighted.
The Fretilin leader also told everyone in his generation that it is time to put “egos” aside and start “thinking together”, highlighting that they have another five years to do so. “The next term of governance must be the product of understanding if we really want this country to move forward”, stated Mari Alkatiri, highlighting that the Timorese people deserve “much more and much better” than what has been given to date.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 17:33:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Independence | Ramos-Horta: It is “thanks to Xanana” that Timor-Leste is here</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/23/independencia-ramos-horta-e-gracas-ao-xanana-que-timor-leste-esta-aqui/</link><description>The Timorese President, José Ramos-Horta, highlighted, in an interview with Lusa, the journey of the current prime minister and former leader of the residence, highlighting that it is “thanks to Xanana [Gusmão]” that Timor-Leste is here today.
“Xanana survived and with an impressive willpower, which few human beings can have, reorganizes the resistance, new attacks against the Indonesians”, said Ramos-Horta, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the declaration of independence, on November 28, 1975, remembering the attacks that the prime minister was the target of.
The Timorese leader lost men and suffered setbacks, but organized the clandestine network and resistance in the occupied cities. Xanana Gusmão was elected leader of the resistance and commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces for the National Liberation of Timor-Leste (FALINTL) in 1981, having launched the National Unity Policy, developed the Clandestine Front and established the National Council of Maubere Resistance, later named the National Council of Timorese Resistance.
"We reached the referendum in 1999 thanks to Xanana, not thanks to anyone else, obviously, the church got involved, because Xanana had the lucidity to talk to D. Martinho da Costa Lopes, abandon Marxism-Leninism. Thanks to Xanana that we are here today", stated the head of state.
Martinho da Costa Lopes was one of the most important figures in the Catholic Church in East Timor during the Indonesian occupation and played a central role in defending the human rights of the Timorese.
José Ramos-Horta also regretted that they now say that Xanana Gusmão is no longer the great man he was during the fight. "I say: gentlemen, now he was also the one who won the maritime border for us. I don't know who would win", he said, referring to the negotiation of maritime borders with Australia, concluded in 2018 and led by the current Prime Minister.
The President also highlighted that Xanana Gusmão was the one who took the historic decision to diversify from the Petroleum Fund in 2009, which “brought 11 billion dollars in return to Timor” and carried out the reconciliation, without persecution or judgment from anyone.
José Ramos-Horta also highlighted that it is Xanana Gusmão who “continues to have the technical competence” to discuss maritime borders with Indonesia, whose negotiation process began this year, as well as to resolve the Greater Sunrise issue, with the agreement expected to be signed at the beginning of next year.
"He wants to resolve all these issues before leaving power. He does not want to leave these very complex dossiers to the new generation", added the President.
Ideas and defenses
José Ramos-Horta stated that he was not in favor of the unilateral declaration of independence, on November 28, 1975, considering that it was made “hastily” given the imminent occupation by Indonesia.
"I was not in favor of the unilateral declaration of independence, I was, but it wasn't on November 28th. More preparation time was needed, because when you make a unilateral declaration of independence without any preparations, the result was what it was. There was no one. Nobody reacted", said Ramos-Horta, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary.
On November 28, 1975, the current head of state recalls a ceremony without the presence of a “single global personality” and a dark night. "The unilateral declaration of independence was made hastily for reasons determined by the circumstances of the time. The fall of Atabae [municipio de Bobonaro]", said Ramos-Horta.
"The base fell with a large onslaught of regular Indonesian forces, already deep inside Timor-Leste. First Batugadé fell, that was in October, Balibó and Maliana fell, in October and Atabai, fell in the early twenties of November. Soon after, Fretilin declared unilateral independence", explained the President.
The occupation by Indonesia took place on December 7, 1975. “Indonesian forces were already in the national territory before December 7 and the decision in Jakarta had been made in 1974 either Timor-Leste integrates into Indonesia peacefully through some pseudo-democratic act, or Timor-Leste would pass to Indonesian domination by force”, said the Timorese head of state.
The invasion is supported by the United States, Australia and some countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
"Obviously, in that context of 1975, the United States would not support Portugal on the issue of Timor-Leste. On the issue of Timor-Leste, Indonesia weighed more, especially in the post-Vietnam war context, in which the United States was discredited and fled. For the United States and for the countries in the region, the communist threat was real and Timor-Leste was isolated, abandoned", highlighted the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
The liberation of Timor-Leste took place on August 30, 1999, when the referendum for self-determination took place, which gave victory to independence, which would eventually take place on May 20, 2002, after a transitional administration by the United Nations.
“Twenty-four years later the country is freed against all the prophets of defeat, all those who preached realism to us, to me, some said atrocious unrealism, others said a lost cause, we heard a lot, including in Portugal”, added Ramos-Horta, highlighting that Timor-Leste managed to prevail.
Defense of the constitutional amendment
José Ramos-Horta defended, in the same interview, a constitutional amendment to adopt the presidential system in the country, because there is a need for “clear authority” and “without duality” and ruled out a re-candidacy for the position.
"I believe that we should make a constitutional amendment and move to the presidential system. The President is the executive, the so-called semi-presidentialism is over", said José Ramos-Horta, in an interview with Lusa as part of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, on November 28, 1975.
Currently, Timor-Leste has a semi-presidential system with a parliamentary bias, with the Government emanating from parliament. According to the head of state, the system chosen in the Constitution, drawn up in 2001 and 2002, “has not been bad at all”, but it has been seen that instead of “instead of being a balancing factor”, it can be a “factor of instability”.
Ramos-Horta exemplified what happened in the eighth Government, after the coalition led by Xanana Gusmão won the legislative elections with an absolute majority. “Xanana is invited to form a Government, they presented the list of rulers and President Lu Olo decides to veto, he did not want to inaugurate nine members”, said the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
"It is necessary to have a clear authority and without this duality, to share power with the President. It doesn't work. It works well in Portugal", highlighted Ramos-Horta. For the Timorese President, “there is no reason” for Timor-Leste to have adopted that model, because “balance is the parliament, the judiciary”.
"These three bodies are the constitution of the State. I think everyone will agree", he said. José Ramos-Horta considered that “it is time”, after around 25 years of the current Constitution, to make “some amendments” and move to the presidential system.
"For me, Xanana Gusmão should continue. We reach 2027, my term ends, new elections in 2028. Between the period of 2027, in which I leave, and 2028, we actively work on a constitutional amendment so that the 2028 election is already based on the new Constitution, that is what I defend", he explained.
When asked by Lusa whether he did not intend to run for a new term, the President stated that he was not “at least motivated”. “I, in 2027, will go to the ceremony of transition of the portfolio to the new President at midnight on May 19, 2027 and I won't even attend the ceremony on the 20th. I'm already in AeroDili on my way to Singapore”, he stated.
Problems of the new generation
In the same conversation, José Ramos-Horta also highlighted some of the country's current problems, namely the fact that the generation after 1975 has not yet found a leader with national affirmation. He highlighted that since 2002, members of this generation have held seats in the Government and parliament.
"The new generation has been there since 2002. The problem is that the new generation has not yet found a single person to assert themselves as a national leader. They have not yet appeared. That is the problem. They are in the Government, in the courts, in parliament, all new generations", said the President in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence.
José Ramos-Horta also questioned who is the leader of the new generation that “has a national dimension”. “There is none, not one, because in a democracy you have to win the electorate”, he said, highlighting that a party is created and that party competes in the elections.
The head of state highlighted, however, that today Timor-Leste already has 210 doctorates and 1,700 masters, graduated from “good universities” and “there are people who know”. Timorese civil society has accused the current Timorese leadership, which continues to focus on figures from the resistance era, of creating obstacles to the emergence of new leaders with the capacity to respond to contemporary challenges.
Asked whether, after 50 years of the unilateral declaration of independence, the Timorese are reconciled, Ramos-Horta stated that among the “factions of [19]75 more than reconciled”. "Some have even died, the majority have died. There is no problem at all. When I see some brilliant being saying 'they are still the divisions of 75', you don't know that the majority have already died, only if they are the souls in the cemetery", said José Ramos-Horta.
According to the President, the divisions result from the democratic struggle. “I find it ridiculous, interesting, sometimes frustrating when I hear that the Timorese are divided,” said the President.
"Very well, let's all unite like it is done in North Korea, or rather, single party, single candidate, it is already known who wins the elections in North Korea, so there is not much headache, everything is simple, 97% votes for Kim Jong-un, then they do the recount and after all it was not 97%, but it was 101%. It's an option, then we are all united", joked Ramos-Horta.
But, he added, the Timorese chose democracy. "A democracy that is praised today and survives the wave of setbacks against democracy in Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe. We are doing very well with democracy", he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-11-23 18:59:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Cuca Roseta, fado singer: “Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/cuca-roseta-fadista-o-fado-e-um-samba-poesia-cantado-vindo-do-coracao/</link><description>During the pandemic, she sang for the Macau public through a video concert, but now, the fado singer gives her heart and soul to a concert with the Macau Chinese Orchestra, part of the lineup for the Macau International Music Festival, next Saturday, 11th. In an interview with HM, Cuca Roseta talks about the show's lineup, her 15-year career and the truth found in her compositions.
Performs in Macau on October 11th with the Macau Chinese Orchestra (OCM). Tell me a little about what we can expect from this show.
Yes, we are finally going to Macau. It will be the first time because we previously did a video concert for Macau during the pandemic, and we were unable to be there physically. We now work with OCM, which is very good, and I am happy with this partnership, for being able to unite, in some way, two cultures. We are a little anxious about that fact.
The concert will have songs such as “Meu”, “Preto e Branco”, “Canção do Mar”, “Não Sei de Onde” and “Finalmente”. O que nos traz este alinhamento?
We already had arrangements made for orchestra by Marinho de Freitas, which are extraordinary arrangements, and which will be adapted to the traditional OCM instruments. These songs are practically all written by me, lyrics and music, and tell different stories, some that I have lived myself or stories that, in some way, I have experienced someone living very closely. They are original fados. “Canção do Mar” is very old and became known in the voices of Dulce Pontes and Amália Rodrigues, and has a new arrangement. We thought it would look beautiful with OCM. Of course, there are songs that we always sing and that never leave the repertoire, linked to traditional phases of my career. There are some songs that people like and request, but we bring a completely different repertoire to what we presented at the time [in Macau, with the video concert], which was very well received. It was a concert that went very well, even though it was via video, and we received wonderful messages.
This year he released the album “Até a Fé Se Esqueceu”, which has an exclusively Brazilian repertoire, with several names in Brazilian music, such as Seu Jorge or Zeca Pagodinho. Why explore this universe, mixing it with the language of Fado?
Yes, but this year I will also release a French album with Amália Rodrigues' agent, who invited me. But “Até a Fé Se Esqueceu” came from an invitation from a great Brazilian producer to record old sambas, which have a lot to do with Fado. Even though it's a Brazilian album, all sambas, it's my saddest album of all, the most melancholic. That's why we went looking for this root of samba to find great poets and great composers that Brazil has, and who have this weight that Fado also has.
As?
Fado has a lot to do with words and composition, in fact, Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart, because there has to be this truth in the interpretation, the idea of ​​truth coming from life's experiences, in transforming the story it tells. This melancholy is in the veins of Portuguese blood and is mixed with art and music. This invitation wanted to put a fado singer to sing seriously and with the weight that Fado brings, and be able to interpret the great poets and sambas. The album [Até a Fé Se Esqueceu] has very old sambas, one of them from 1937. It is, therefore, a very strong and even very beautiful album, with great poems and composers, such as Tom Jobim, Vinicius de Morais, and wonderful partnerships with Seu Jorge and Zeca Pagodinho, who came to Fado. It's an album that made me really proud.

Therefore, it is possible to marry Fado with the joy of samba, which also has a melancholic side, right? Like the melancholy of our Fado.
In fact, when we hear the word samba we think of joy, but in fact the basis of samba is not joy. There is that phrase by Vinicius de Morais, “To make a samba beautifully you need a bit of sadness, otherwise you won’t make a samba”. So that's where the beauty of this work lies, which goes to the roots of samba and shows that there aren't that many differences between the melancholy at the root of samba and the melancholy of Fado. It's a nostalgic and melancholic album, it doesn't bring that joy. It can bring hope, and we can say that some themes bring with them this hope, which we find in Brazilian culture and drums. Because they literally put their sadness on the skirt wheel and on the drums, right? They transform sadness into dance and music, but in this work we don't see that type of samba.
Cuca also has a previous album, “Cabo Verde Nha Cretcheu”, so it can be said that she has explored, in her career, the different Portuguese-speaking sounds, going beyond Fado, mixing sounds?
This album didn't come from my will, and I think [it's a sign] that life takes me, deep down. This album was born from a tour I took across the nine islands of Cape Verde with a live recording of the mornas I sang on each island, as I sang the traditional mornas of each island. Between one island and another there are very different moraines. What I did was, after my Fado concerts, I sang two mornas and then we compiled all the songs in Creole in celebration of the fact that I was the first international artist to do the nine islands in a row. But I was also in Goa and did my concert in Concanim. I find it easy and enjoy learning the traditional songs of the countries where I am going to sing. I already sang in Moscow and learned a Russian song; I learned the songs of Goa, and in Georgia, in Tblisi, I also learned a song. It's a treat I make when I travel around the world taking Fado. But morna is wonderful and there really are similarities between this musical genre, and I wanted to bring this encounter between Fado and morna to Cape Verdeans, and this album came about, which is beautiful.
Once it goes to Macau, can we expect a song in Cantonese, or Mandarin?
Yes. By chance, I had already spoken to my manager to contact someone in this regard, so that we could discover a traditional song that I could learn.
Last year, he celebrated 15 years of career. How do you review your career, which began with the albums “Cuca Roseta” and “Raiz”?
In fact, it was great to celebrate 15 years at MEO Arena [the concert hall in Lisbon], and be able to revisit all the albums since the first. “Raiz” opened something that is rarer, which is the fado singer composing and writing her lyrics. This was a record that went wonderfully well and, from then on, it was good, because in this search for the truth that Fado has, being able to compose and write your own lyrics always means giving a little more of yourself. Each person composes and writes in their own way, and when they can do it, it is always a bit like the lines on the palm of their hand, that is, it is something unique. In this search that people make to follow standards to achieve success, I believe that success exists when we are not afraid to follow our voice and our instinct, what comes from our heart, tell our stories and sing our melodies without fear. In this way we end up becoming unique. Although it is not usual in Fado for a fado singer to compose and write, it was nice to see that my songs became important to many fans. Sometimes I have great composers and poets [to collaborate with me], but I think [writing and composing] brings out this side of the person being more truthful. My poems can never be compared to those of the great poets I have sung, but I think people feel that I am more in my own skin. In a way, this touches and moves them. Celebrating 15 years of career was the closing of a cycle and the beginning of another, and it was great to return to the “roots”, and realize that that was where the “gunpowder” lay, in the sense of not being afraid of ourselves.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:24:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist activist, 34 years old, physical engineer, Romani national. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied the right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on staying, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
The gentlemen we are talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Roadsport | Badaraco took the podium on his birthday, but ended up penalized</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/17/roadsport-badaraco-subiu-ao-podio-em-dia-de-aniversario-mas-acabou-penalizado/</link><description>On his birthday, Badaraco recovered from 17th to reach second place on the podium. Hours after the party, the bad news arrived, with a penalty relegating him to 15th. Rui Valente was placed off the track, after recovering several positions
On his birthday, Jerónimo Badaraco climbed to second place on the podium of the Roadsport Challenge race, after starting from 17th. However, the worst came later, when the top three, all local drivers, were penalized and relegated in the general classification, for overtaking other cars that had lost their way before the starting line, after the safety car had left.
The Macanese driver had a setback when he was relegated to 15th, after an almost perfect race: “It was very unfair and I think the stewards don't know what they are doing”, said Jerónimo. "I think the decision was not transparent. After the safety car came out, several drivers hit the barriers... of course we thought they weren't going to continue in the race after those crashes and we had to overtake them", he explained. “And even if we had stopped or slowed down in the face of these drivers' missteps, we would have created a much more dangerous situation for everyone, because the cars behind us would have been surprised by our braking, meaning there would have been more accidents”, he explained.
Even so, the Macanese assured HM that the penalty would not ruin his day: “I will continue to enjoy the day, I went up to the podium, drank the champagne, took the photos… More cup, less cup, I will continue to celebrate”, he guaranteed with a laugh.
Hours earlier, Badaraco had already explained that reaching the podium in Guia “is a different feeling” that justifies “80 percent” his choice to drive 26 years ago.
The driver was also satisfied with the race, considering that no one can take away the merit of what he achieved on the track, as he rose from 17th to 2nd: "Before the race I thought a lot about how I was going to approach the start, to recover positions, and I was confident of a good result. The most important thing was not to have given up, after qualifying, and not to have stopped believing that it was possible to reach the podium", explained the Macanese driver. “I know that the Guia Circuit always has a lot of changes throughout the race, there are a lot of safety cars and yellow flags, and I knew I had the experience, and also the calm, to be able to take advantage of the opportunities”, he highlighted.
“They ruined my race”
In turn, Rui Valente gave up and appeared disappointed, due to what he considered to be an excess on the part of the driver who tried to overtake him on the inside, on the curve leading to the São Francisco road. "I don't know what was going through the driver's head who tried to overtake me. I can't understand how he saw a space that simply didn't exist!", said Valente. "I was put out of the race. When I tried to make the turn, he touched me and that was it, my rear end was damaged and I had to go back to the pits to retire", he reported.
When the crash occurred that ended the race, Valente was circulating in the top 10, even after a less successful start, following the exit of the first Safety Car. Despite this aspect, the Macanese came to believe that it was possible to achieve a result in the top five: “I had a good pace, I was confident and I think I would achieve a result in the top five... It's the races...”, he lamented.
The Macanese also took stock of a “complicated” weekend in which he was also involved in another accident during the free practice session. "To be honest, it wasn't one of the weekends I had the most fun in Macau. I had that first touch, which conditioned my qualifying. In the race I actually did well, gaining positions, but they put me off the track...", he highlighted.
At 64 years old, Rui Valente now admits that he may be left out of the next edition of the Grand Prix: “With such a difficult qualifying model for Macau and then with races with so many accidents, I will consider what to do in the future”, he confessed. “I don't want to sit still, I want to stay active and involved in different activities, so if I find an activity that occupies me and makes me feel good, maybe I'll stay out of racing next year”, he said.

Over the four days of the Macau Grand Prix, more than 110 thousand people passed through the stands of the Guia Circuit, an increase compared to last year, which was marked by the passage of a typhoon. According to official figures, the good weather helped and on Thursday there were more than 15 thousand spectators, on Friday around 28 thousand and on Saturday 35 thousand. Yesterday, on the day of the main races, the number of spectators was over 32 thousand.
Tobacco | Harmony Racing fined
Driver Ye Yifei's Harmony Racing team was fined 500 euros after one of its members was caught smoking in the garage. According to the stewards' sanction, the team member was smoking when he was approached by those responsible. When he was caught, he immediately put out his cigarette, inside a glass, containing five other butts.
Great Bay | Lu Wenlong has become superior
Lu Wenlong (Lotus Emira) was the winner of the GT Cup-Greater Bay Race, finishing ahead of Han Lichao (Toyota GR Supra GT4 Evo2) and Liu Kai Shun (Lotus Emira). The experienced Leong Ian Veng (BMW M4 GT4) was the best driver in Macau, finishing in fourth place, very close to the podium. In what he admitted was a farewell to Guia, Darryl O’Young (Mercedes AMG GT4 EVO), who competed in the GT Cup for several years, did nothing more than withdraw. The Hong Kong driver crashed the Mercedes when he went head-on at the entrance to the San Francisco climb.
Organization | Satisfactory event
The coordinator of the Organizing Committee considered that the event ran satisfactorily and that it contributed, together with the National Games, to creating a festive atmosphere in Macau. Lei Si Leng highlighted the value of the seven races in the program for the Grand Prix, which he said was wonderful.
When asked about a possible return of Formula 3, the official stated that the organization will continue to cooperate with the FIA ​​to choose the races that best suit Macau. At the same time, he left the guarantee that the plan involves continuing to receive drivers of training age and that they are expected to establish themselves as the future of motorsport.</description><pubDate>2025-11-17 04:56:12</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA will continue to invest in Formula Regional in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/24/gp-fia-vai-continuar-a-apostar-na-formula-regional-em-macau/</link><description>The fact that the FIA ​​switched from Formula 3 to Formula Regional (FR) continues to be a recurring theme when the topic is the Macau Grand Prix. Although the show's premier race did not disappoint in this year's edition, somewhat erasing the bad image left last year, there is still a widespread feeling that the international federation deprived the Grand Prix of its favorite race.
At the end of the 72nd edition, the Coordinator of the Organizing Committee of the Macau Grand Prix, Lei Si Leng, when questioned again by the local press about a possible return of Formula 3, stated that the organization will continue to cooperate with the FIA ​​to choose the races that best suit Macau. At the same time, the director of the Macau Sports Institute left the guarantee that the plan involves continuing to receive drivers of training age and who assert themselves as the future of motorsport.
“We have been communicating closely with the FIA ​​to find out which races can be held in Macau and the FIA ​​has selected the best drivers to come and compete here”, he said, adding that he hopes “that the best drivers can come to Macau and that we continue to collaborate with the FIA ​​to organize the most suitable races for Macau”.
On the FIA ​​side, there is the conviction that FR is the discipline that best adapts to the characteristics of the Guia Circuit, a layout that remains practically unchanged after seven decades of existence. The discontent that still exists is considered natural. “Motor sport is traditional, and I don't remember any change that was well received at the beginning, even good changes” admitted Emanuele Pirro, the current president of the FIA ​​Single Seater Commission, in conversation with journalists in Macau.
The former Italian driver, a connoisseur of the Guia Circuit and winner of the Guia Race with BMW, took advantage of his time in the Macao SAR to remember that “if we look at the history of Macau, it started with Formula 2, or Formula Pacific, and then moved on to Formula 3. In 1984, a journalist could have asked: 'why don't we race in Formula 2 anymore?' I think it's inevitable. Everything has a price. For us to have the privilege of having a circuit that has remained unchanged since Throughout its history, the price to pay is to use cars that continue to be reasonably safe. And I think Formula Regional offers a good balance in terms of speed.”
In a rare interview with the specialized magazine INSIDE, the former coordinator of the Grand Prix, José Manuel Costa Antunes, warned against letting the level of the race drop. "Today, with the transition to Formula Regional and Formula 4, which is not a problem, they are just different cars, we see more inexperienced drivers", said the man who was at the helm of the event for the longest time, touching on a sensitive topic: "Some people can simply buy a seat. That is worrying. As fans, we want real races, not red flags. We owe it to the history of the Grand Prix to recover that selection process, to ensure that only the best compete here."
Numbers support the decision
Looking at the time sheets, it can be concluded that the records for the main FR race were around 2m16s, around ten seconds slower than the times recorded in the last year of the FIA F3 single-seaters, in 2023. In historical terms, these times place the FR cars on a level similar to that of the Formula 3 cars of the late 1990s. However, from a safety point of view, the speeds reached in the “Sprint” for Curva Lisboa continues to be the main concern since Sophia Flörsch’s accident in 2018. With the suction cone, speeds above 290 km/h were common in 2023 with the Dallara F3, but the change to FR cars reduced these values to around 260 km/h.
In 2026, the new Formula Regional car, the Tatuus T-326, is expected to arrive in Macau, which is equipped with a three-cylinder, 1.6-liter Toyota ATM163T engine, prepared by Autotecnica Motori, which is more powerful and efficient. The chassis was designed according to the latest FIA specifications, in order to provide improvements in terms of performance, safety and aerodynamics, facilitating overtaking and promoting more lively racing. However, although lap times are expected to drop again, top speeds will probably not be dramatically higher.
It should be noted that the change to FR was not motivated solely by security concerns. When the FIA ​​granted Formula One Management (FOM) the commercial and promotional rights for Formula 3, the territory's race became a non-championship race of an international competition, limited to the participation of the same teams that competed in the championship. This change was received unfavorably by the promoter himself, as he never played a truly intervening role within the Grand Prix. Furthermore, holding the race in Macau, in November, involved particularly demanding logistics, with a negative impact on the planning and execution of pre-season tests.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 05:37:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorsport | GP will continue on the TCR World Tour in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/19/automobilismo-gp-continuara-no-tcr-world-tour-em-2026/</link><description>The Macau Grand Prix will once again form part of the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour calendar next season and, once again, as the season-ending event of a competition that will increase its presence in Asia in 2026
Marcelo Lotti, president of the WSC Group, confirmed to the press, during the weekend of the 72nd Macau Grand Prix, that next year's calendar should include a race in South Korea – home country of the tire brand and championship sponsor, Kumho, as well as Hyundai, the brand with the most cars on the starting grids of the world competition -, a second race in the People's Republic of China and the traditional end-of-season round at the Guia Circuit.
To increase the presence on the Asian continent, without affecting the teams' budgets, Australia will be left out of the calendar. The championship promoter will also not move forward with the possibility of organizing a second race on the American continent, with a visit to Mexico being a certainty. Already on the “old continent”, the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour will maintain its three events, with the Portuguese city circuit of Vila Real hosting one of these events in July.
For Marcello Lotti, “the Macau Grand Prix is ​​our equivalent to Monaco”, and for the Italian businessman, “all championships need an event like this”. Despite the smaller number of entrants that this year's event gathered in the territory, “leaving Macau is obviously out of the question”.
The 2026 Kumho FIA TCR World Tour season calendar is expected to be revealed to the public on December 13, when the FIA ​​World Council meets in Tashkent, Republic of Uzbekistan, at the same time as the FIA's annual awards ceremony.
Number questions
The list of participants for the Guia Race Macau – Kumho FIA TCR World Tour Event of Macau had only seventeen of the twenty-four cars initially registered. This would have been one of the smallest starting grids ever for the highly popular Guia Race, whose first edition took place in 1972. In part, this number below expectations was due to the absence, for unknown reasons, of teams and drivers from TCR China, one of the strongest national tourism championships in the world.
Meanwhile, Marcello Lotti said during the Grand Prix weekend that TCR is preparing to welcome a new brand to the championship. However, this announcement, scheduled for next Friday, is not expected to have an impact on the starting grids of the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour, as it will be a car group that already has a presence in the championship and will replace one of its brands with another. The Italian businessman also said he was in negotiations with a second brand.
Asia's influence on today's biggest Touring Car championship is not just limited to the Koreans from Kumho and Hyundai, as the competition also features the Chinese brand Link &amp; Co, at an official level, and the Japanese counterpart Honda. At a time when electric cars, SUVs and city cars are the focus of big brands, Asian manufacturers are still among the few that invest in cars, with fuel engines, with dimensions suitable for Touring events.</description><pubDate>2025-11-19 01:34:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Taça GT Macau | Fuoco avenges the 2024 disaster and wins without a problem</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/17/taca-gt-macau-fuoco-vinga-desastre-de-2024-e-vence-sem-espinhas/</link><description>The Italian driver finally managed to take the Ferrari to the highest place on the podium, and overtook Raffaele Marciello, the driver he collided with last year at Curva do Lisboa, when he was leading, and which earned him a retirement.
Antonio Fuoco (Ferrari 296 GT3) was the winner of the Macau GT Cup, a race that he dominated from the beginning to the end. The Italian thus avenged last year's retirement, after being forced to retire, when he was leading, after a contact with Raffaele Marciello (BMW M4 GT3), at Curva do Lisboa.
"I think it's very special to win in Macau, especially after what happened last year. But this is part of racing, and the main thing was to come back this year, and manage to do everything well", said Fuoco. "The team did everything for us to come back and win (…) I tried to make a strong start, and push hard in the last corner to open up an advantage over the rest. I pushed a lot and at a certain point I was losing control of the car in the Mandarin Curve, but everything went well", he said.
Fuoco also praised the new qualifying format, with a second session only for the best qualified: “it was a lot of fun, I think it was a good change”, he considered.
In second place was Raffaele Marciello, who had won last year, but who in this edition never showed the pace to threaten Ferrari's dominance. However, the Swiss was once again involved in collisions, this time with Alessio Picariello (Porsche 911 GT3 R), who ended up in the barriers.
“I tried to recover at the beginning and I almost managed (…) but the Ferraris had a good start and it was a difficult race”, said the driver. “The car was very difficult to drive, so at a certain point I had to realize that the important thing was to reach the end”, he added.
Porsche with different fortunes
Porsche also secured a presence on the podium, through German Laurin Heinrich (Porsche 911 GT3 R). “I knew that starting from eighth place on the grid it would be very difficult to recover, but I think I benefited when I lost a position in the qualifying race, because that way I was on the most favorable side of the starting grid”, he reported.
Heinrich also acknowledged that he did not have the pace to achieve more than the lowest place on the podium. "I tried to put pressure on Raffaele Marciello, but I felt there was no progress for him, so I knew I could only do better if he made a big mistake, which he didn't. The race went like this also to make sure there was no pressure from behind", he pointed out.
Heinrich also regretted the touch on teammate Ayhancan Guven, which caused the Turk to be left out of the race: "On the one hand I'm happy with the podium, but I'm also sad about what happened. I think my colleague had a good pace and deserved more", he lamented.

Ye Yifei popularity phenomenon
Ye Yifei (Ferrari 296 GT3) returned to Macau, in the year in which he became the first Chinese driver to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the greatest achievement so far in motorsport in the Middle Kingdom. Despite racing in Macau with an Italian license, the Chinese driver was welcomed as a national hero and was one of the most sought after drivers in the paddock to take photographs and sign autographs. The driver even dreamed of victory, after starting from second place on the starting grid, but a less successful start meant he did not go beyond fifth place in the end. Nothing that would affect his popularity, given that after the race he continued to be the most sought after among fans.</description><pubDate>2025-11-17 04:54:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorcycles | Todd crowned King of Guia after driving recital</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/17/motas-todd-coroado-o-rei-da-guia-depois-de-recital-de-conducao/</link><description>After a year in which he was declared the winner without a race, Davey Todd showed that he is currently the fastest driver on the Guia Circuit, dominating throughout the weekend. In the end, he regretted not having set a new circuit record
Davey Todd (BMW M1000RR) was the winner of the 57th edition of the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix, on a weekend in which he did not give his competition any chance. After being declared the winner of last year's edition, without there being a race due to rain, the Englishman returned and removed all doubts about the fact that he is currently the fastest driver in the category.
“It was a fantastic result,” said Todd, moments after the victory. "I knew I had a good pace, that I was strong, but that Peter was also going to be fast in the race. Fortunately, I managed to push from the start, gain a significant advantage in the first few laps, and in the end I just had to manage", he explained.
As happened last year, rain once again interfered with the organization's plans and qualifying, which was originally scheduled for Friday morning, was moved to Saturday, right before the main race.
Todd secured pole position and during the race he never let go of that place again, building a considerable advantage lap by lap, enough to cross the finish line in a wheelie.
However, the winner regretted not having taken advantage of Saturday's high pace to set a new circuit record. "I think I'm disappointed with the fact that I was close to breaking the circuit record, but, during the race, I didn't know what times I was running. I was very close, so I could have beaten that record", he lamented. “But we are here to win the race, it is not to break records, so the most important thing has been achieved”, he stressed.
In recovery
In second place was four-time Macau winner Peter Hickman (BMW M1000RR), who had to deal with gear problems on the first lap. Recovering from a major accident, the Englishman started from third and took advantage of Erno Kostamo's (BMW M1000RR) mistake, who went ahead at Curva do Lisboa, taking the middle spot on the podium.
In the end, Hickman acknowledged that he had a good pace, but was far from ideal shape: "I need to work more on my body, to gain endurance. At this point, I have the necessary strength, but I get tired quickly. I'll have to work in the winter", acknowledged Hickman.
The driver also admitted that he was scared in the first laps by Erno Kostamo's driving. “To be honest I was a little scared with the way Erno was running, because he started with a really strong pace, but he was also making big mistakes,” revealed Hickman. "Luckily he didn't fall, because if he fell I would have fallen with him. This also allowed him to gain some advantage at the beginning", he acknowledged. “Then, when he went ahead at Curva do Lisboa, I managed to have a free track, and I managed to do my race”, he indicated.
Happy running
Mistakes aside, the Finn was one of the great entertainers of the race. He started from second place, lost position at the beginning and until the Hotel Lisboa curve, still on the first lap, he managed to regain it.
Then, due to the error, he dropped to fifth place and in just over a lap he rose to third. Therefore, despite the incidents, Kostamo said he was happy with the result: "In three laps I pushed the pace a lot. It's true that I made a big mistake at Curva do Lisboa, when I missed the braking point, which was crazy", he reported. “But I’m happy with the result and for having set the fastest lap of the race,” he said.
