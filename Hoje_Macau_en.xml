Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun declared, at a press conference, that Beijing “has always developed ties with Berlin from a strategic and long-term perspective”.
Guo stressed that, as “large countries and leading world economies”, China and Germany maintain a “mutually beneficial” cooperative relationship. “Under the current circumstances, both parties must continue to push their ties in the right direction,” he added.
The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed last week the postponement of Johann Wadephul's visit, scheduled for October 28th and 29th, after the Chinese side did not confirm further meetings beyond the meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.
German diplomacy spokeswoman Kathrin Deschauer expressed Berlin's “great concern” about the restrictions imposed by Beijing on the export of certain components used in the production of semiconductors and rare earth materials, measures that raised alarm in the German automotive industry.
Trade tensions between the two countries intensified after the intervention of the Dutch State in the chip manufacturer Nexperia, a subsidiary of the Chinese Wingtech, which led Beijing to restrict exports of crucial components for the sector. The ban is generating concern among the Volkswagen Group, Europe's largest car manufacturer.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 02:07:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Association leader says HK learns from Macau elections</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/dirigente-associativo-diz-que-hk-aprende-com-eleicoes-de-macau/</link><description>Hong Kong is going to elections for the Legislative Council (LegCo), the local parliament, on December 7th and in connection with this event, Lo Man-tuen, president of the association China Peaceful Development General Summit of Hong Kong-Macao-Taiwan Diaspora, stated that the Hong Kong rulers have already gone to Macau to learn from the experiences of the last electoral act, which elected deputies via direct and indirect access to the Legislative Assembly (AL).
This information was expressed in an opinion article published by the newspaper Ming Pao, where the leader highlights the high turnout of Macau voters at the polls, with a participation rate of 53.35 percent. Lo Man-tuen also recalled that the participation rate in the elections by public servants was very high, so the politician understands that learning from Macau's electoral experience serves as an example for mobilization in the Hong Kong elections, using “all efforts”.
"All associations and entities in Hong Kong will organize electoral activities. I believe that there will be a great unprecedented mobilization and that Hong Kong society will show up [to vote]. Of course, the turnout rate will rise and surpass the numbers of previous elections", reads the opinion article.
Concordant positions
This opinion by Lo Man-tuen comes after the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office published an article last week highlighting the importance of holding elections in Hong Kong, warning of anti-China forces that could disturb the territory, interfering or even interrupting the election.
Lo Man-tuen references this article, reporting that recently “several bizarre theories that interrupt the elections” have emerged, such as the “fabricated false allegation that there is ‘interference by the Central Government in the elections”, or when the “bless list [of candidates accepted by the Central Government] was released”. The author of the article also gives the example of speeches that boycott the elections.
It should be remembered that the elections for the VIII LA of Macau ended on September 14th, registering an electoral participation of 11 percent more compared to the previous elections, in 2021, with 175,272 voters voting. This number of voters broke the historical record after 1999, when the administration of the territory passed from Portugal to China.
The spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office spoke the day after the elections, speaking of the successful holding of the elections, something that was a “remarkable achievement in fully implementing the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’ and promoting a high-quality democracy that adapts to the real conditions of Macau”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:35:51</pubDate></item><item><title>PJ | Indicted for kidnapping and rape of lover</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/pj-indiciado-por-sequestro-e-violacao-de-amante/</link><description>The Judiciary Police (PJ) announced the arrest of a 34-year-old man on suspicion of kidnapping, rape and serious harm to the physical integrity of his lover. The case took place in a local hotel, after the two began an extramarital relationship last year.
According to the PJ's version, the man and woman are from the interior, where they met and began a romantic relationship. However, the most recent meeting in Macau ended with the alleged commission of several crimes. After a meeting in a restaurant on Saturday morning, the woman was blackmailed into going to the man's hotel room in Macau. If she refused, the lover threatened to reveal the relationship to her husband and his entire family.
The woman eventually gave in, but when she arrived at the hotel room she was raped and kidnapped for at least an hour. After the first attack, the woman contacted her sister to ask for help and ended up being attacked, with an ashtray on her head, in addition to being strangled with a cell phone charger cable.
Given his injuries, the man allowed the victim to contact his sister, who in turn alerted the police. The suspect ended up being detained by the authorities, and when questioned by the authorities he asserted his right to silence.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:45:44</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC | Hu Jiawen exhibition to see from today</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/frc-exposicao-de-hu-jiawen-para-ver-a-partir-de-hoje/</link><description>A Fundação Rui Cunha (FRC) apresenta hoje uma nova exposição. It is “Radiant Blue”, with works by Hu Jiawen, an artist who explores all her creativity in connection with the universe of Gongbi painting and other traditional Chinese painting techniques. To view until November 8th
The artist Hu Jiawen presents today, at the Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC), several of her painting works, in a new exhibition open until the 8th of November. This is “Radiant Blue”, with its opening scheduled for today, starting at 6:30 pm, where “the spectator is invited to immerse themselves in a world where the traditional and the contemporary coexist, through the dialogue between the calm lines of meticulous brushwork and the intense metallic burns, of blue paint and gold leaf”, highlights the FRC, in a statement.
This exhibition includes 30 works composed of Gongbi painting, traditional Chinese painting, experimental painting, contemporary painting, mixed media with metal foil, and bronze sculpture. Highlight is the “accurate selection” of works by the curator and renowned local artist, Chang Kuok Meng, in an exhibition organized by the FRC, the Macau Youth Art Association and the Macau Fine Arts Artists Association.
According to the organization's manifesto, this solo exhibition is an “exploration of visual art rooted in meticulous traditional figure painting, integrating experimental techniques of Indian ink, blue printing and gold leaf burning”. Here, “the artist reconstructs oriental aesthetics from traditional and contemporary perspectives, creating an environment of painting on silk and rice paper, which embodies both classical meaning and modern consciousness”.
Go beyond the usual
According to Hu Jiawen, “Radiant Blue” reveals the “effort to leave the comfort zone and go beyond the label of ‘Gongbi Figure Painting'”, where the artist “uses different means” to try to “transmit the emotions and status of women in virtual and in-person spaces, hoping that the public will appreciate the beauty that arises from imperfection and transformation”.
There are “female figures in the works that often exist in a space-time intertwined with reality and illusion”, showing “the delicate representation of meticulous brushwork”, or even “the transformative quality of experimental paint and the deep layers of blue printing”.
These “are further highlighted by the intervention of burnt gold leaf, in the sense that its cracks and imperfections do not mean damage, but rather give the figures character and a sense of temporal texture”. Then there is “the light and hue created by the burnt gold leaf that suggest the fusion of emotions and the impression of memories”.
Hu Jiawen has a bachelor's degree in Visual Arts Education from Macau Polytechnic University and a master's degree in Education from the University of Macau. Currently residing in the territory, she dedicates herself to artistic education and is employed by the Canton International Art Fair, in addition to performing other functions in various artistic organizations. His works have been exhibited in places such as Beijing, Guangzhou and Macau, receiving awards and being included in several collections. He is proficient in different genres, with a special talent for traditional Chinese painting, sketching, oil painting, engraving, ceramics, and fine brushstroke Gongbi figure painting.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:49:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Light Rail | Only two in every 100 young people use transport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/metro-ligeiro-apenas-dois-em-cada-100-jovens-utilizam-transporte/</link><description>Poor network coverage and the distance to residential areas mean that young people rarely use the metro. Among users, the main reason is the desire to have a different experience
Only 1.5 percent of young people in Macau say they use the Light Rail as their main means of transport, that is, less than two out of every 100 young people. The conclusion is part of the study prepared by the New Chinese Youth Association of Macau, the results of which were presented yesterday.
Based on a survey in which 647 young residents were questioned, aged between 18 and 44, the association concluded that the Light Rail is the least used means of transport of all those available in the territory.
When asked to answer about the main means of transport in Macau, around 36.6 percent of respondents admitted that they mainly use buses. Private vehicles, such as cars or motorcycles, were indicated as the main means of travel for 31.9 percent of young people, while 26.3 percent responded that they traveled mainly on foot. Only 1.5 percent of those questioned indicated the metro as their main means of transport.
Despite not being the main means of transport, 58.7 percent said they had used the metro at least once in the last year. However, almost seven in ten (68.4 percent) of these respondents were infrequent users, using every three months or less regularly.
The Light Rail is still considered by users as “an experience” more than a form of transport that responds to everyday needs. Regarding the reason that led young people to choose the metro, 33.9 percent said that using it was justified “just by the experience”, while 22.1 percent said they would go to a border, and 21.3 percent said they would go to large hotels.
Does not heat up or cool down
Regarding the quality of the service, the largest group of young users are indifferent, with 39.3 percent responding that it is “neither good nor bad”. Conversely, 39.1 percent stated that satisfaction is “good or very good”. The results presented by the association do not allow us to know the total degree of dissatisfaction, however, there were also 14.2 percent of respondents who indicated that the experience on the metro was “not satisfactory” or “not very satisfying”
Among young people who do not use the metro, 46.1 percent cited the fact that the “stations are too far from their homes” as the main reason, while 35.6 percent justified their non-use due to limited network coverage and 33.3 percent indicated that the metro does not provide direct access to the places they frequent most.
One of the factors that also contributes to keeping young people away is the fact that payments made through applications that use QR technology are not accepted. Around 61.7 percent stated that due to this reason they feel less desire to use this transport.
Currently, the Light Metro can be used by purchasing a ticket at ticket machines, which do not accept QR Code technology, but also at physical ticket offices. Those interested can also use the Macau Pass, passing directly through the access turnstiles.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:43:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Courts | Departure of Portuguese judge confirmed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/tribunais-saida-de-juiz-portugues-confirmada/</link><description>Judge Rui Ribeiro will leave the Macao SAR courts starting next month. The information had been made public by Lusa, which cited the judge himself as a source, and was confirmed yesterday through an order, published in the Official Bulletin.
“Judge Rui Carlos dos Santos Pereira Ribeiro is dismissed, at his request, from the position of judge of the Court of Second Instance of the Special Administrative Region of Macau […] from November 1, 2025”, the document reads.
According to the news agency, Rui Ribeiro asked to return to Portugal, due to uncertainty about authorization from the Portuguese Superior Council of Judiciary (CSM) to continue in the Macao SAR. The judge has been in Macau since September 1, 2008, and in Portugal he is part of the Civil Section of the Court of Appeal of Guimarães.
Last week, the president of the CSM, João Cura Mariano, showed his willingness to send more judges to Macau, despite admitting that there is also a lack of human resources in Portugal
With Rui Ribeiro's departure, there is only one Portuguese judge left in Macau, Jerónimo Alberto Gonçalves Santos, who serves as president of a collective court at the Base Judicial Court (TJB). Jerónimo Santos has been in the Macao SAR courts since September 1, 2005, being part of the Intellectual Property, Competition, Regulation and Supervision section of the Lisbon Court of Appeal in Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:40:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Great Bay | Projected salary increases of 3% in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/grande-baia-projeccao-de-aumentos-salariais-de-3-em-macau/</link><description>In the most recent Greater Bay Area Remuneration and Benefits Survey Report 2025, 15.4 percent of 39 companies in Macau point to a salary increase of around 3 percent for 2026. The technology area is the one that pays the most to a recent graduate, with a salary of 19 thousand patacas
Some data on the salary panorama and benefits granted to workers in the context of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area 2025 are now known, thanks to a new survey released on Friday.
According to an official statement, Macau is represented by 39 companies surveyed, of which 15.4 percent expect a salary increase of three percent for next year. Meanwhile, there are “33 organizations that have not yet decided on expected salary increases”, and “no organization has indicated a salary freeze”.
Forecasts for 2026 point to a salary adjustment of 3.1 percent in management or senior positions, supervisory positions or general staff, while employees in operational or customer service roles may receive increases of 3 percent. These are nicer numbers compared to this year, whose increase percentages are around 1.3 percent and 2.9 percent depending on the different professional positions. In 2022, the year of the pandemic, salary adjustments did not exceed 1 percent, and in senior or management personnel positions there was even a drop of 0.1 percent.
Between the months of July 2024 and June 2025, there was an average salary increase of 1.6 percent in the 39 companies surveyed in Macau, while 24 reported a salary freeze. Excluding these companies that did not increase values, “the real average salary increase was, in general terms, in the remaining organizations, 3.4 percent”.
These data refer to the 2025 Greater Bay Area Remuneration and Benefits Survey Report, which in the case of Macau includes companies linked to six sectors of activity, namely hotels and restaurants, banking, insurance, finance, culture and entertainment, or even commerce and engineering. The survey covered a total of 54,195 employees in Macau.
Who pays more?
The presentation of the Survey took place last Friday at the Faculty of Business Administration of the University of Macau (UM), and was carried out by this university, the Human Resources Association of the Greater Bay Area of ​​Macau and several higher education institutions in the Greater Bay Area, including the Human Resources Strategy and Development Center of the Faculty of Administration of the Hong Kong Baptist University, among others.
Still in the case of Macau, it is highlighted that graduates in the area of ​​information technology are those with the highest salary at the beginning of their careers, in the order of 19 thousand patacas, while in Guangdong province, for the same type of work, a recent graduate earns around 6 thousand renminbis. If you have more advanced studies, such as a postgraduate degree or master's degree, the salary increases to 8,500 renminbis. In Guangdong province, the highest salaries for a recent graduate are in the area of ​​“R&amp;D”, research and development of new products, with 6,500 renminbi. Those with more advanced studies than a bachelor's degree can reach a salary of 9,500 renimbis.
In the case of Hong Kong, salaries for those just leaving university are higher in the engineering field, paying an average of 21,500 Hong Kong dollars currently.
The survey was carried out in June this year among more than three thousand companies in the Greater Bay Area, and between the months of July and September 258 valid questionnaires were received: 39 from Macao SAR, 141 from Guangdong province and 78 from Hong Kong. In total, they cover 244 thousand employees who participated through an individualized panel system using artificial intelligence, entitled “My AI Salary Consultant”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:39:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Kiang Wu | Association received 234.14 million patacas</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/kiang-wu-associacao-recebeu-23414-milhoes-de-patacas/</link><description>The Kiang Wu Hospital Charitable Association received almost 9 out of every 10 patacas distributed in support by the Health Services in the third quarter.

The Kiang Wu Hospital Charity Association received 234.14 million patacas in subsidies paid by the Health Services, which in the third quarter of this year totaled 270.35 million patacas. The data was revealed last week, and means that for every 10 patacas distributed by the SS in support, practically nine end up deposited in the private hospital's accounts.

In March, the amount was 41.74 million patacas, in July it dropped to 41.36 million patacas and in April it was 40.21 million patacas.
These transfers represented 166.35 million patacas of the total 234.14 million received by the institution.
The second largest type of support granted by the Health Services to Kiang Wu was due to the “protocol subsidy to finance the medical expenses of cardiac patients”. As part of this support, four monetary tranches were paid, corresponding to four months.
In March, financing of medical expenses for cardiac patients reached the highest value, with a total of 12.70 million patacas. In May, the value was 9.87 million patacas, while in April it was 7.68 million patacas and in June 7.48 million patacas.

In the list, it is possible to find other associations such as Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Macau, which received around 103 thousand patacas, and Cáritas de Macau, to which 315 thousand patacas were distributed. In the case of these two institutions, the support was due to the provision of medical care in local nursing homes.
The names of the supported institutions also include the New Chinese Youth Association of Macau, which received 5.17 million patacas, to support the recovery center in providing external consultations or cancer screening.

These “are further highlighted by the intervention of burnt gold leaf, in the sense that its cracks and imperfections do not mean damage, but rather give the figures character and a sense of temporal texture”. Then there is “the light and hue created by the burnt gold leaf that suggest the fusion of emotions and the impression of memories”.
Hu Jiawen has a bachelor's degree in Visual Arts Education from Macau Polytechnic University and a master's degree in Education from the University of Macau. Currently residing in the territory, she dedicates herself to artistic education and is employed by the Canton International Art Fair, in addition to performing other functions in various artistic organizations. His works have been exhibited in places such as Beijing, Guangzhou and Macau, receiving awards and being included in several collections. He is proficient in different genres, with a special talent for traditional Chinese painting, sketching, oil painting, engraving, ceramics, and fine brushstroke Gongbi figure painting.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:49:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Exhibition on intangible cultural heritage at the Macau Museum</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/mostra-sobre-patrimonio-cultural-intangivel-no-museu-de-macau/</link><description>A new exhibition on the intangible cultural heritage of the Greater Bay Area opens to the public this Saturday, entitled “A New Impulse – Cultivated Greater Bay Area, A Brilliant Intangible Cultural Heritage: Exhibition of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area”. The initiative can be seen at the Macau Museum until March 15th next year.
Organized with several museum entities in the province of Guangdong and Hong Kong, the exhibition “will encompass a thematic exhibition, interactive demonstrations of artisanal techniques, workshops and the sale of cultural and creative products related to intangible cultural heritage”.
The exhibition presents “more than 50 manifestations representative of the intangible cultural heritage of the Greater Bay Area, including Cantonese embroidery, colored paper crafts, wood carvings and Cantonese porcelain”.
The aim is, in this way, “to make the public aware of the artisanal techniques of the intangible cultural heritage in the traditional cultural context of Lingnan, as well as the oriental aesthetics formed through the fusion of Chinese and Western cultures, as evidenced in the intangible cultural heritage of the Greater Bay Area”.
The great interaction
In connection with the opening of this exhibition, there will be “interactive demonstrations of artisanal techniques” on the weekend, Saturday and Sunday, in places such as the Fortaleza do Monte garden and the Macau Museum. These demonstrations cover various arts, including Foshan Chinese New Year woodblock painting, Hakka qilin dancing from Hang Hau in Sai Kung, Portuguese tile making and painting, Portuguese folk dance and lion dance.
Also included are demonstrations of Wing Chun martial arts, Choi Lei Fat martial arts, Naamyam Narrative Songs, Taoist ritual music and Baatyam percussion. The entire program can be seen on the Macau Museum portal.
The workshops will also take place on the 1st and 2nd of November, at the Macau Museum, Casa do Mandarin and Zheng Guanying Memorial Museum, focusing on puppet theater for the whole family, creating bookmarks made with gold thread embroidery or even creating Cantonese opera accessories.
A highlight is the holding, this Saturday, of two guided tour sessions at the exhibition. The deadline for registering for some activities is Wednesday, which can be done on the Macau Single Account platform.
In addition to all the activities mentioned above, between Saturday and Monday, the sale of cultural and creative products related to intangible cultural heritage will take place in the garden of Fortaleza do Monte.
This exhibition is “the first large-scale traveling exhibition dedicated to the intangible cultural heritage of the Greater Bay Area”, and the first edition, entitled “Celebrating National Day - Auspicious Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area”, was held in Hong Kong in October last year. Earlier this year the same exhibition was held in Shenzhen, called “New Year in Shenzhen: Grand Gathering in the Greater Bay Area”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:47:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Trump wants to make a good deal with China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/diplomacia-trump-quer-realizar-um-bom-acordo-com-a-china/</link><description>The President of the United States, Donald Trump, stated yesterday that he hopes to “reach a good agreement” during the next meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, including a pact related to the TikTok platform, according to the international press.
Trump declared, aboard Air Force One, that TikTok will be one of the topics he will discuss with Xi during the meeting, scheduled for this Thursday, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which will take place in the South Korean city of Gyeongju, according to the EFE news agency. According to the US President, the agreement, signed between Washington and the parent company of the popular video platform, the Chinese ByteDance, already has Xi's “provisional approval”.
In September, the United States reached an agreement with Beijing-backed ByteDance to allow TikTok to continue operating on North American soil, after the US Congress established in 2024 that the application should be deactivated due to the risk it posed to the country's national security.
The pact establishes the creation of a mostly North American joint venture, with an operation sufficiently separate from its Chinese parent company — which will maintain a 20 percent stake —, especially with regard to the Chinese Government's access to servers that store user data.
The face-to-face meeting between the two leaders will provide an opportunity for both powers to ease tensions following Beijing's announcement of restrictions on the sale of its rare earths and to discuss a possible comprehensive trade agreement after months of tariff tensions.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 02:06:20</pubDate></item><item><title>HK | Smuggling case worth 200 million dollars discovered</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/contrabando-sete-casos-na-semana-passada/</link><description>Shark fins, cigars, cell phones, pharmaceutical products and even donkey skin. These are the products discovered in two more smuggling cases discovered by the Hong Kong Customs Service (SA) on the 3rd and 7th of this month.
According to a statement from this organization, the value of the goods is around 200 million US dollars, with two ships involved, one of them destined for river trade. This ship was destined for Macau and was caught by the authorities on October 3rd. Five containers destined for Taiwan were also inspected and were declared to be transporting frozen food. On October 7, the SA in Hong Kong realized that 150 tons of donkey skin were circulating here and not the declared food.
The same statement indicates that the investigation continues and that “the possibility of arrests is not excluded”. Under Hong Kong's Import and Export Law, anyone found guilty of importing or exporting undeclared cargo is subject to a maximum fine of US$2 million and a seven-year prison sentence upon conviction.
Seven cases last week
Taking into account the holding of the National Games starting next month, the Customs Service (SA) wants to show service and admitted to having reinforced inspection efforts at the Portas do Cerco Border Post. As a result of these efforts, seven cases of smuggling were recorded between 21 and 25 October.
According to a statement from the SA of Macau, within the scope of the seven cases, customs agents found a total of 120 old cell phones, often used to circumvent internet access limitations, 85 pieces of electronic products and 1344 grams of cigar.
The smugglers involved residents of Macau and the Interior, aged between 38 and 64. Those involved were fined, the SA announced, under the provisions of the foreign trade law.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Paulo Maia and Carmo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Yelu Abaoji (872-926), the head of the nomadic Khitan people, a word translated as Qidan, contrary to tradition, decided to establish in his vast territory in 916 a dynasty in the style of the disintegrated Tang dynasty (618-907) and all the others that preceded it, with the succession of the maximum leader becoming hereditary and not a choice by a council tribal.
He even went so far as, once again going against nomadic tradition, to build a «Supreme capital», Shangjing, Linhuangfu, designed in a grid pattern with streets aligned in the style of Chang’an, the capital of the Tang. And although it was the tribal military who made the decisions, Han civilians were chosen for state administration. He called this State Da Qidan and was posthumously given the title of Taizu Tian Huangdi, “Heavenly Emperor Taizu”. His successor would change the name of the dynasty to Liao and despite subsequent setbacks, this would be the name that would prevail.
Abaoji had a son, Yelu Bei (899-937), whom he named Crown Prince and gave the title Renhuang Wang, «Imperial King of Men», handing him over the governance of the kingdom of Dongdan. And when the time for succession arrived, Yelu Bei naturally expected to inherit his father's title, but his mother, the ruthless Empress Dowager Shulu Ping (879-953), had other plans and with cold blood and cunning made the succession fall to another of her sons.
What was improbable followed in Yelu Bei's life would be remembered years later by the poet, calligrapher and painter of the Yuan dynasty, Zhu Derun (1294-1365). Next to the figure of a horseman on a swift ride in the Deer Hunt on a horizontal scroll that was attributed to Yelu Bei (ink and color on paper, 24.6 x 79.9 cm, in the Metmuseum) he wrote: «To escape the persecution of Yelu Deguang (r. as Liao Taizong, 927-947) he crossed the sea and arrived at Dengzhou (in Shandong) and there he paid allegiance to Emperor Mingzong (r.925-933) of the Late Tang (923-936) and in return was granted the name Li and the commandership of Huaihai.”
Li Zanhua would therefore be the name that Yelu Bei would use from then on. A name – Li – of enormous prestige because this was the name of the ruling family during the Tang dynasty, offered by Emperor Xianzong (r.805-820) to the founders of that second of the Five Dynasties period as a reward for their loyalty and which they carried, like the name Tang, with pride. Li Zanhua, wrote Zhu Derun, “used to take paintings and books with him when he traveled. He liked to paint knights with bows, on hunts or excursions. His clothes and accessories followed the rustic conventions of the barbarians because that was what he was used to and felt comfortable with. The way he used the brush was soft and fine while the dynamism of the men and horses corresponds to the spirit of the 8th century Tang. A painting that deserves to be appreciated.”</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>The Chinese Government defended yesterday that China and Germany must maintain relations based on “mutual respect, equal treatment and mutually beneficial cooperation”, after the postponement of a visit by the German Foreign Minister.

The decision was taken after a meeting with his government colleague in charge of Culture, Rachida Dati, said the same ministerial source, cited by the French news agency AFP.
The institution, in the center of the French capital, remained closed yesterday, one day after a group, still at large, managed to steal multiple works of jewelry art. "The Louvre Museum will remain closed today (yesterday) for exceptional reasons. We apologize for the inconvenience", read a message published on the museum's official website.
A group of four men stole jewelry on Sunday morning, in just a few minutes and when the museum was already open and with visitors inside, using a forklift machine, parked on the respective bank of the River Seine, and raising it to the height of a window on the first floor of the building.
The group took eight pieces “of inestimable heritage value”, including the tiara of Empress Eugenie (wife of Napoleon III, emperor from 1852 to 1870) and two necklaces, the French Ministry of Culture reported on Sunday. That jewel alone has 212 pearls and 1,998 diamonds, according to the Louvre's description, while the pieces belonging to Queen Maria Amélia have multiple sapphires and hundreds of diamonds.
This Parisian museum is the largest and most visited in the world, with nine million people enjoying part of the 35,000 works that the institution houses, in its 73 thousand square meters of space.</description><pubDate>2025-10-21 01:53:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Cuts leave 13.7 million people at risk of extreme hunger</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/16/cortes-levam-137-milhoes-de-pessoas-a-correr-risco-de-fome-extrema/</link><description>Cuts in humanitarian aid funding could expose up to 13.7 million people to extreme hunger around the world, the World Food Program (WFP) warned yesterday. “The humanitarian aid system is under severe pressure as partners withdraw from frontline areas, creating a void,” the Rome-based agency said in a new report titled “A lifebuoy in danger.”
The UN agency said that six of its operations – in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan – are “facing major disruptions, which will only worsen”. WFP warned that its financing “has never been so challenging”, anticipating “a 40 percent drop” in 2025, “which will translate into a projected budget of US$6.4 billion, compared to US$10 billion in 2024”.
The report does not name any countries, but points to a study published in the medical journal The Lancet, which found that 14 million additional deaths worldwide from disease, nutritional deficiencies and maternal and perinatal conditions could occur by 2030 as a result of cuts in US humanitarian aid alone.
Returns and records
Since US President Donald Trump's return to the White House, Washington has announced massive cuts in its foreign aid, dealing a huge blow to humanitarian operations around the world. "Program coverage has been significantly reduced and rations cut. Vital assistance to families in food disaster situations [Phase 5 of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification/IPC] is threatened, while preparedness for future impacts has significantly decreased," warns WFP.
Globally, “WFP estimates that its funding gaps could push 10.5 to 13.7 million people currently in acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) into a humanitarian emergency (IPC Phase 4),” the organization added. The UN agency said global hunger has now reached record levels, with 319 million people facing acute food insecurity — including 44 million at emergency levels.</description><pubDate>2025-10-16 02:52:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Death | António Coelho dies aged 77, but leaves a legacy in Portuguese gastronomy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/14/obito-antonio-coelho-morre-com-77-anos-mas-deixa-legado-na-gastronomia-portuguesa/</link><description>The founder of Restaurante António died on Sunday in Macau, due to heart problems. Behind him, he leaves a mark and an innovative concept for promoting Portuguese food in Asia
A father, a friend and one of the great ambassadors of Portuguese gastronomy in Asia. Chef António Coelho died on Sunday, aged 77, due to heart problems, but leaves behind a professional career spanning almost 40 years and an influence that can be felt in several restaurants and Portuguese food chefs in Macau.
Born in Portugal in 1948, António Coelho's first contact with Macau took place in 1970, when he had to complete his four-year mandatory military service. After two years, the land remained in his memory, but the future chef chose to return to Europe.
In Portugal, he started working at Social Security, later moving to a clinical analysis laboratory. It was in this area that he developed his taste for gastronomy, not through work, but through various lunches and dinners in different restaurants. Increasingly interested in cooking, António decided to take a job, in 1984, in a restaurant, where he admitted to having learned to cook, according to an interview with the South China Morning Post newspaper, in 2018.
The first years of António Coelho's new career were spent in Portugal, where he performed different roles as manager-administrator of the Botequim do Rei restaurant or director of the catering department at the Grande Hotel da Curia. In 1996, he had his first international experience, as director of the restaurant department at the Hotel Trópico, in Cape Verde. The experience lasts one year.
Creating a legacy
Returning to Macau in 1997, António worked for 10 years in different spaces, such as the restaurants Frol de la Mar, Lusitano, Lisbon, and also had a brief stay in Hong Kong, in 2002, at Restaurante Inn. However, the decisive step towards his affirmation as one of the most influential chefs of Portuguese gastronomy in Asia came in 2007, with the opening of Restaurante António.
And the success that followed was not the result of chance, as said by Edgar Rodrigues, a chef who came to Macau to work on the launch of the project: “The success was based on the recipes, the quality of the food, but also the very professionalism”, says Edgar Rodrigues, to HM. "He was very attentive to his customers. If there was an order for clams à bolhão pato, he would have different recipes adapted to the nationality. For example, Koreans don't like coriander, the recipe for them didn't have coriander. Chinese customers like little salt, they were served with little salt, and locals like the more traditional recipe. In a single dish there were several ways of cooking, just to satisfy different customers", he recalls.
Cristiano Tavares, currently chef at the Macalhau restaurant, also came to Macau to work at the António Restaurant. He believes that the chef found a position for Portuguese food that still influences other restaurants today. “I think his success was due to his way of being, he was a politically correct person, he had a way of working that pleased both Chinese, Korean and Japanese tourists”, explained Cristiano Tavares, to HM. "We were a street restaurant with four or five cooks. He managed to do what many large restaurants still cannot do today. Nowadays there are many restaurants with Portuguese food that open in Macau, but follow the example of what he did", he considered.
Quality and spectacle
In addition to the food, Restaurante António customers were seduced by the “show”. This is the vision of Marcelino Marques, António's friend and musician who for several years livened up the space's nights, with traditional Portuguese music.
"The quality of the food made the space popular. He took great care in choosing the food and drinks served. He went to Portugal to choose wines from various regions, such as Douro or Alentejo, all of high quality, which were bottled under the António brand. People knew they weren't going to pay little, not that it was a space with luxury prices, it wasn't, but the quantity served wasn't small", recalled Marcelino Marques.
However, the musician believes that the success was also due to a concept in which the meal was also a spectacle: "People liked listening to Portuguese music, but also being with António. He was an affable, big person and appeared in that white jacket with the flags of Portugal, China and Macau and people liked his presence and asked him to take photographs", he says. "He also opened a bottle of champagne with a sword. He did a whole ceremony and people really liked it. It was a spectacle and a party to see the cork flying out of the bottle. It worked well", he recalled.
Marcelino Marques recalls that the food and the show made the restaurant very famous, especially among Japanese, Korean and Hong Kong tourists. The musician reveals that Japanese tourists booked days in advance. And this factor also contributed to the fact that António offered a glass of port wine at the end of the meal, which also led to the recognition of the Port Wine Confraternity.
The success of Restaurante António led the chef to sell the space to an investment fund, becoming an ambassador for the space. The break with the fund happened in 2020, when he was fired without just cause. The case ended up in court, with António winning the case. In recent years, António took on the position of executive chef at Angela’s Café and Lounge, at the Hotel Lisboeta.
A father, a friend
Due to his work in Macau, António was distinguished, in 2013, by the Macao SAR Government with the MSAR Tourist Merit Medal. Also in 2015, he received the merit medal for Portuguese communities from the Portuguese Government. However, for those who worked with him, the most important thing was the relationship that went beyond the strictly professional field.
"He had a big impact on Macau and for me he was like a second father. When I came to Macau I didn't have an easy life and he always held my hand", confessed Rodrigues. "He was always a person who was there for me. And I always saw him as a man of iron. In everything he did, there was a great will", he pointed out.
This is a feeling shared by Cristiano Tavares. "António is my father in Macau. He worked until the last day, always with seriousness, honesty and integrity. He is an example for all the chefs in this area", he said.
For Marcelino Marques, António's death is the loss of a friend. "António was the person who welcomed me to Macau and was capable of doing the same to everyone. He was strict and demanding, but he was an excellent person", he described. "Everyone knew him. He was an affable person and received people like no one else", he added.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Pop Mart, maker of Labubu, falls 10.8% in Hong Kong amid doubts about growth</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/24/pop-mart-fabricante-de-labubu-cai-108-em-hong-kong-entre-duvidas-sobre-crescimento/</link><description>Shares in Pop Mart, the Chinese company responsible for the global phenomenon of Labubu figures, sank 10.8% this Thursday, the biggest drop since April, in a new episode of volatility that contrasts with the good sales results released the day before.
The devaluation reflects investors' growing caution regarding the possibility of a slowdown in the company's growth, after several quarters driven by the popularity of its collectible products.
On Wednesday, Pop Mart shares rose 4.23% on the Hong Kong stock exchange, despite the negative tone of the market, following the announcement that revenue in the third quarter increased between 245% and 250%, driven by Labubu's virality on social media and the company's international expansion.
According to data provided by the company, domestic sales grew 190%, while international sales soared 370%, highlighted by increases of 175% in the Asia-Pacific region, more than 740% in Europe and almost 1,270% in the United States. The strong drop recorded today is largely attributed to profit taking, after appreciation of more than 186% since the beginning of the year, and uncertainty about the sustainability of the current growth rate.
The stock fell 8.1% on Tuesday, its worst performance since April, weighed down by fears of a slowdown in sales after months of euphoria. The preliminary release of results helped to temporarily dispel these concerns, but the absence of an official date for the presentation of the accounts maintains uncertainty regarding the company's future evolution. Executive chairman and founder Wang Ning expressed confidence in the long-term resilience of the Labubu character, arguing that cultural icons continue to generate revenue even after peak popularity.
According to the Bloomberg agency, the explosion in demand forced the company itself to revise its internal goals upwards. If at the beginning of 2024 Pop Mart predicted a turnover of 2,800 million dollars (around 2,400 million euros), in August Wang raised this target to 4,200 million dollars (3,600 million euros), pointing to the brand's global momentum as a key factor.
Founded in Beijing in 2010, Pop Mart has established itself as one of the main Asian references in the toy and collectible figures sector, combining exclusive design, limited editions and collaborations with international brands, artists and franchises.
Its business model is based on so-called “surprise boxes”, which encourage repeat purchases and have created a community of fans willing to pay high premiums for rare pieces. Among its main lines is Labubu, a monster with pointy ears and a mischievous smile inspired by Norse mythology, created by Hong Kong artist Lung Ka-sing in 2015 and integrated into the company's portfolio in 2019.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Chemistry | Nobel Prize for the development of metal-organic structures</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/09/quimica-nobel-para-o-desenvolvimento-de-estruturas-metalorganicas/</link><description>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Susumu Kitagawa, from Kyoto University, Richard Robson, from the University of Melbourne, and Omar M. Yaghi, from the University of California, “for the development of metal-organic structures”, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced yesterday.
Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar Yaghi have developed a new form of molecular architecture – metal-organic frameworks – that can be used to collect water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide, store toxic gases or catalyze chemical reactions.
The three laureates created molecular constructs with large spaces through which gases and other chemicals could flow. The president of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, Heiner Linque, highlighted precisely the fact that these “metal-organic structures have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for personalized materials with new functions”.
The research that led to the discovery of this new form of molecular architecture began nearly four decades ago, in 1989, when Richard Robson tested the use of the inherent properties of atoms by combining positively charged copper ions with a four-armed molecule.
When combined, they bonded "to form a spacious, well-ordered crystal. It was like a diamond filled with countless cavities," the academy explains. Robson immediately realized the potential of his molecular construction, but it was still unstable and crumbled easily. It was chemists Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi who managed to provide a solid foundation for this construction method.
Notable applications
Following the discoveries of the three laureates, chemists built tens of thousands of different MOFs. Some of them could contribute to solving some of humanity's biggest challenges, with applications including breaking down traces of pharmaceuticals in the environment, capturing carbon dioxide or collecting water from desert air.
The discovery also allows the separation of perfluoroalkylated and polyfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) from water. PFAS are a group of synthetic chemical compounds known as “forever chemicals” due to their extreme persistence in the environment and in the human body.
PFAS are used in a wide range of industrial and household products, such as stain- and water-resistant textiles, food packaging, non-stick cookware and firefighting foams. Its accumulation in the environment and potential health risks, including liver damage and other problems, have led to concerns and a search for safer alternatives.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:41:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Study | Trump was the main disseminator of disinformation in the USA in 2024</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/09/estudo-trump-foi-principal-disseminador-de-desinformacao-nos-eua-em-2024/</link><description>North American President Donald Trump was the main disseminator of disinformation in the United States of America (USA) in 2024, concluded a study by the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ). “US President Donald Trump was the dominant source and distributor of disinformation” in 2024, say the authors of the study “Disarming Disinformation: United States”.
The study highlights that Trump has drawn on the functions of domestic political forces, rather than foreign state actors, as the main source of disinformation narratives in US political discourse. Furthermore, the existence of WhatsApp groups and other closed digital spaces often act as “information cocoons” that encourage rumors and other forms of misinformation.
In this way, "the viral spread of misinformation and the strategic attack on journalists have emerged as interconnected threats to democracy. In an era of increasing authoritarianism and democratic backsliding, falsehoods are often used as a weapon by state actors to influence public opinion, undermine journalism and intimidate journalists."
The study authors state that these factors are increasingly the North American reality, with Donald Trump “promulgating manifestly false narratives” in recent years.
“The American media faces a profound information crisis, at a time of repression of freedom of expression”, the study reads. In this sense, trust in the mainstream press continues to decline in a climate of increasing attacks on the media by the Trump Government.
The study published by the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) was based on the analysis of 10,000 news and media publications during 2024, as well as a survey of 1,020 Americans.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:38:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Scientists 'reduce' the age of the Egyptian temple of Karnak, in Egypt</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/08/cientistas-reduzem-idade-do-templo-egipcio-de-karnak-no-egipto/</link><description>Researchers have carried out the most comprehensive geoarchaeological study of the Karnak temple, near Luxor, and revealed suggestive links to ancient Egyptian mythology and new data about the interaction between the complex's riverine landscape and the people who occupied the site during its almost 3,000 years of use.
The results of the investigation were published on Monday in Antiquity magazine, reported the Efe news agency. Researchers from the University of Southampton, in the United Kingdom, and Uppsala University, in Sweden, participated in the study. Up to 61 sediment samples from the interior and surroundings of the temple and thousands of ceramic fragments found in the Karnak complex, located 500 meters east of the current Nile River, near Luxor, in the ancient Egyptian religious capital of Thebes, were analyzed.
The researchers mapped how the landscape around the site changed throughout its history and found that, before 2520 BC, the site could not have been suitable for permanent occupation due to periodic flooding caused by the Nile's strong currents. Therefore, they placed the earliest occupation at Karnak during the Old Kingdom (between 2591 and 2152 BC).
Pottery fragments found at the site corroborate this discovery, with the oldest dating between 2305 and 1980 BC. Therefore, the conclusions of this international team of researchers provide new evidence about the age of Karnak, which has been hotly debated in archaeological circles for decades.
The origin of everything
The ground on which the temple was founded was formed when river channels advanced west and east, creating an island of high ground in what is now the east-southeast region of the site. This emerging island laid the foundation for the occupation and initial construction of Karnak.
Over the following centuries and millennia, the river channels on both sides of the site diverged further, creating more space for the development of the temple complex, as researchers have now confirmed. This new understanding of the temple's landscape bears striking similarities to an ancient Egyptian creation myth, leading the team to believe that the decision to locate the temple there may have been related to the religious views of its inhabitants.
Ancient Egyptian texts from the Old Kingdom indicate that the 'Creator God' manifested himself as high ground emerging from the lake, and researchers have found that the island where Karnak was founded is the only known area of ​​high ground surrounded by water in the region.
Thus, archaeologists have suggested that the Theban elites chose the location of Karnak to be the abode of a new form of 'Creator God', alluding to Amun-Ra, the supreme god of ancient Egypt, since the location fit perfectly into the mythological setting of the highlands that emerged from the surrounding waters as the origin of the formation of the Universe.</description><pubDate>2025-10-08 17:22:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Kiang Wu | Association received 234.14 million patacas</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/kiang-wu-associacao-recebeu-23414-milhoes-de-patacas/</link><description>The Kiang Wu Hospital Charitable Association received almost 9 out of every 10 patacas distributed in support by the Health Services in the third quarter. In total, 270.35 million patacas were allocated in subsidies
The Kiang Wu Hospital Charity Association received 234.14 million patacas in subsidies paid by the Health Services, which in the third quarter of this year totaled 270.35 million patacas. The data was revealed last week, and means that for every 10 patacas distributed by the SS in support, practically nine end up deposited in the private hospital's accounts.
The main supports were declared as “subsidy for the inpatient service”, referring to different months of the year, in a total of four subsidies. All of this support for the inpatient service amounted to more than 40 million patacas, with the highest amount being reached in May, with a tranche of 43.04 million patacas. In March, the amount was 41.74 million patacas, in July it dropped to 41.36 million patacas and in April it was 40.21 million patacas.
These transfers represented 166.35 million patacas of the total 234.14 million received by the institution.
The second largest type of support granted by the Health Services to Kiang Wu was due to the “protocol subsidy to finance the medical expenses of cardiac patients”. As part of this support, four monetary tranches were paid, corresponding to four months.
In March, financing of medical expenses for cardiac patients reached the highest value, with a total of 12.70 million patacas. In May, the value was 9.87 million patacas, while in April it was 7.68 million patacas and in June 7.48 million patacas.
Other smaller supports involved subsidizing the operation of the Hong Ling Center, expenses with examination services for cervical cancer screening, external vaccination consultations and subsidizing audit expenses for the Kiang Wu School of Nursing for the year 2023. 
Regular customers
As for the associations supported by the SS, the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau (FAOM) received 18.37 million patacas, with the majority of the subsidies going to the rehabilitation nursing services of the Recovery Center.
The SS granted the center three tranches of 4.57 million patacas, for the operation of the center in the months of July, August and September. Other support to FAOM aimed at “providing external consultation services”, with monthly support amounting to just over 1 million patacas.
On the podium of the most supported institutions, the Tong Sin Tong Charitable Association also appears, receiving 9.48 million patacas. Among this support, the largest share was justified with the “provision of external consultation and treatment services” in the months of September, August and July. In all periods there was a fixed subsidy of 3.08 million patacas. However, there was also other smaller support, with subsidies of around 50 thousand patacas officially justified with a “fissure sealant program”.
List of institutions
The distribution of the 270.35 million patacas by the SS covered 12 local institutions. In the list, it is possible to find other associations such as Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Macau, which received around 103 thousand patacas, and Cáritas de Macau, to which 315 thousand patacas were distributed. In the case of these two institutions, the support was due to the provision of medical care in local nursing homes.
The names of the supported institutions also include the New Chinese Youth Association of Macau, which received 5.17 million patacas, to support the recovery center in providing external consultations or cancer screening. This association also received a subsidy of 160 patacas, the lowest of those awarded, related to HIV virus screening tests.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:37:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Association leader says HK learns from Macau elections</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/dirigente-associativo-diz-que-hk-aprende-com-eleicoes-de-macau/</link><description>Hong Kong is going to elections for the Legislative Council (LegCo), the local parliament, on December 7th and in connection with this event, Lo Man-tuen, president of the association China Peaceful Development General Summit of Hong Kong-Macao-Taiwan Diaspora, stated that the Hong Kong rulers have already gone to Macau to learn from the experiences of the last electoral act, which elected deputies via direct and indirect access to the Legislative Assembly (AL).
This information was expressed in an opinion article published by the newspaper Ming Pao, where the leader highlights the high turnout of Macau voters at the polls, with a participation rate of 53.35 percent. Lo Man-tuen also recalled that the participation rate in the elections by public servants was very high, so the politician understands that learning from Macau's electoral experience serves as an example for mobilization in the Hong Kong elections, using “all efforts”.
"All associations and entities in Hong Kong will organize electoral activities. I believe that there will be a great unprecedented mobilization and that Hong Kong society will show up [to vote]. Of course, the turnout rate will rise and surpass the numbers of previous elections", reads the opinion article.
Concordant positions
This opinion by Lo Man-tuen comes after the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office published an article last week highlighting the importance of holding elections in Hong Kong, warning of anti-China forces that could disturb the territory, interfering or even interrupting the election.
Lo Man-tuen references this article, reporting that recently “several bizarre theories that interrupt the elections” have emerged, such as the “fabricated false allegation that there is ‘interference by the Central Government in the elections”, or when the “bless list [of candidates accepted by the Central Government] was released”. The author of the article also gives the example of speeches that boycott the elections.
It should be remembered that the elections for the VIII LA of Macau ended on September 14th, registering an electoral participation of 11 percent more compared to the previous elections, in 2021, with 175,272 voters voting. This number of voters broke a historic record after 1999, when the administration of the territory passed from Portugal to China.
The spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office spoke the day after the elections, speaking of the successful holding of the elections, something that was a “remarkable achievement in fully implementing the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’ and promoting a high-quality democracy that adapts to the real conditions of Macau”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:35:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Waldo and Emperor | Government coordinates changes for 182 workers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/waldo-e-emperor-governo-coordena-mudancas-de-182-trabalhadores/</link><description>The satellite casinos Waldo and Emperor Palace, linked to Galaxy and Sociedade de Jogo de Macau, respectively, close this week, which will require changes to the gaming tables and the roles of 182 workers. The Gaming Inspection and Coordination Services Directorate says it is coordinating the situation with operators
The Waldo and Emperor Palace casinos are permanently closing their doors this week. In the case of Waldo, linked to the Galaxy group, the closure is scheduled for Friday, 31st, at 11:59 pm, while the Emperor casino, linked to Sociedade de Jogo de Macau (SJM), will close on Thursday, 30th. The closing of these two gaming spaces occurs in the context of the end of satellite casinos by the end of the year, December 31st.
In a statement, the Directorate of Gaming Inspection and Coordination Services (DICJ) promises to “strictly supervise the closure procedures of the aforementioned casinos, in order to ensure that they proceed in a stable and orderly manner and that all legal procedures are being duly complied with”.
At issue are changes to the gaming tables and the roles of 182 workers, 71 at the Emperor Palace casino and 111 at Waldo. In a statement, Galaxy determined that Waldo's gaming tables “will be relocated to other casinos” under the group's operation, being “committed to safeguarding local employment”.
In concrete terms, “members currently working at Waldo Casino will be transferred to other casinos or non-gaming related roles, based on operational needs, with all contractual terms of employment remaining unchanged”.
Galaxy also promises to provide these workers with “a series of professional training programs to support their transition to new work environments and ensure continued professional stability”.
As far as Emperor Palace is concerned, the same promise of “protecting local employment” also remains. All employees “will remain employed, being transferred to other company casinos to perform gaming-related functions, according to operational needs”, highlights SJM in a note.
In the case of residents who work for Emperor and who are not directly hired by SJM Resorts, “they will be invited to apply for related vacancies within the group, with priority in hiring under equal circumstances, and will receive the necessary support, depending on the actual situation, to facilitate a smooth transition”, it is stated.
The DICJ promises, in conjunction with the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs, “to ensure strict compliance with the commitments assumed by SJM and Galaxy, with regard to the relocation of the same workers, as well as effective guarantees regarding remuneration, benefits and working conditions”.
Money to be traced
Regarding the redemption of game chips, from Saturday, November 1st, “valid chips with the Galaxy Waldo logo can be redeemed at designated counters at Galaxy Macau Casino or StarWorld Casino”.
In the case of the Emperor Palace casino, SJM describes that all gaming machines and tables “will be transferred to other company casinos in order to continue serving our valued customers”, while “customers who have chips, deposits or cash discounts accumulated at the Emperor Palace casino, and which have not been redeemed after its closure, will be able to visit other casinos operated by SJM Resorts from October 31st for follow-up agreements”, it reads.
Regarding this aspect, the DICJ promises to “designate employees to supervise, ‘in loco’, the formal closure process, ensuring compliance with procedures with regard to the appropriate treatment of cash and game chips stored in the treasury”, among other matters.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:34:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Education | Defended creation of learning vouchers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/27/educacao-defendida-criacao-de-vales-de-aprendizagem/</link><description>Chan Lai Kei, a deputy linked to the Fujian community, questioned the Government about the idea of ​​creating learning vouchers, outside the education system, which would be awarded annually to students with economic difficulties, in order to alleviate the burden on families.
According to a written statement, the deputy argued that, currently, the subsidies granted by the Government take place in a school context, but the courses available in schools may not meet the needs of all students. In turn, the Continuous Development and Improvement Programme, aimed at courses outside the school system, is only aimed at residents over 15 years old, meaning that anyone aged between 6 and 14 has to pay for courses outside of school in full, without any support.
According to Chan Lai Kei, the lack of financial support in this area means that there are limitations to the development of students' potential, also making improvements in terms of social diversity and the achievement of greater educational equity in the long term difficult.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 03:59:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Forum | Promoted digital economy in colloquium</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/27/forum-macau-promovida-economia-digital-em-coloquio/</link><description>The “Colloquium on Digital Economy between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries” ended on Friday.

The goal was reiterated yesterday, through a statement from the office of the Secretary for Transport and Public Works.
“The medium-term goal is for recycled water consumption to represent 5 percent of Macau’s total water consumption, with the long-term goal to exceed 10 percent”, it was announced. This is seen as a way to “further save precious water resources, create greater value for its sustainable development and build a Macau city more oriented towards water saving”.
According to the same statement, “Macau faces a significant shortage of fresh water” and 99 percent of the raw water consumed comes from the interior. The same data indicates that since the end of 1999, “the demand for water has registered a sharp increase, the volume of raw water supplied to Macau in 2024 reached around 105 million cubic meters, which represents an increase of more than 83 percent”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 03:54:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Nick Lei asks for new consumption card</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/27/economia-nick-lei-pede-novo-cartao-do-consumo/</link><description>In a written interpellation, deputy Nick Lei asked the Government to study the possibility of granting another round of the consumption card, similar to what happened during the pandemic.
According to the legislator linked to the Fujian community, the elderly and disabled have great difficulties using the current model of encouraging consumption, which adopts a discount policy.
Previously, the card allocated an amount that could be used, regardless of any spending by the elderly. According to the deputy, if the Government is unable to issue a consumer card to all citizens, it should at least support vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, disabled and people with lower incomes. The law also asks the Executive to carry out a study on the effectiveness of the current model.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 03:53:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Normal People</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/pessoas-normais/</link><description>In 2018, a book came out that quickly became a bestseller, Normal People by Sally Rooney. In 2020, a television series inspired by the book came out, which, with the same name, also became a success. It is a story about two young people, an Irish boy and an Irish girl, from their final year of secondary school, in Sligo, in the west of Ireland, until the end of their degree at Trinity College, in Dublin. People who fall in love, who get confused and who have sex – play the game of intimacy as best they can and delve into fractured and painful issues. Rooney shows that true intimacy is not built on desire, but on the ability to manage, or allow, emotional sharing.
The story is a cliché. A girl who is not popular at school, but who comes from a financially advantaged family background, and a boy who is quite popular at school and who comes from a working class background. They become sexually and emotionally involved in an affair that both brings them together and separates them. They enter the same college and continue to go back and forth between an inordinate passion and moments of incomprehension. But that's where the cliché ends, because the way we are transported to the inner worlds of emotional expression is so rich, it removes us from the usual melodrama and transports us to a reality that is better known to us: ours, with its nuances and confusions. The book is called Normal People because what it portrays is real and normal.
In this story, sexual and physical consent is crossed by an emotional layer that makes it complex. Exploring questions about power, class and the erotic, the characters navigate that world, each with their own distinct capacity for emotional and financial fulfillment. Intimacy is a game of power, of who opens or closes doors to harmony. And the places the characters inhabit are close and distant at the same time, as if they were lost in harmony with one another. Marianne, despite her background, comes from a problematic family that taught her that her wishes, or her existence, were not important. And in this empty space, she offers the other space to overcome limits: she does not choose to give in; she just doesn't know how to contain it. Connell, who lives lost, not knowing where he belongs, finds in Marianne a way to integrate into a world different from his own, which challenges and confuses him. The events are recounted in the intimacy of each person's thoughts, and we see how they awaken diametrically opposed perceptions. Reality ceases to exist and perception shapes what we do and feel. And in moments of physical intimacy, the body becomes the only place where the truth manifests itself. Sex is not a climax, but a way of communicating – the only space where they can say what words could not. Eroticism, according to the author, is pure vulnerability.
In this story there are no villains, no heroes, just people – some say it portrays the lives of millennials in particular, in the confusion of being with others in the current context of labor and even geopolitical instability. Sex “isn't like that with other people”, as they confess to each other, and the romance and eroticism of the story lives in these explicit moments, others silent ones. With a fragmented timeline, we follow the two characters in significant stretches over five years. The rhythm presented to us reveals another mundane fact; they are growing. The relationship between Marianne and Connell is symptomatic of the growing pains that accompany them in discovering who they are – just normal people.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 02:03:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Musk's billion-dollar plan (2)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/o-plano-bilionario-de-musk-2/</link><description>Last week, we talked about Tesla's proposal to award its Executive Director, Elon Musk, 1 billion dollars in shares as a performance bonus, on condition that he achieves a series of objectives. These objectives would be: First, reverse the recent decline in car sales. Second, develop the business of selling autonomous cars, etc. After all targets are met, not only would Tesla's value and profits increase significantly, but Musk would receive huge financial compensation, thus benefiting both parties.
However, as autonomous driving technology is not yet fully developed, and countries around the world will review road legislation in light of this innovation, third-party insurance coverage will also undergo changes. These factors create uncertainty and could affect Tesla. Today, we will continue to analyze the impact that the 1 billion share compensation plan will have on Tesla, Musk and shareholders.
Third, Tesla's plan to manufacture 5,000 to 10,000 Optimus humanoid robots by 2025. The aim is to create robots that can replace manual workers, such as porters, domestic workers, etc. However, Optimus' technology is not yet perfected. Many AI companies are working hard to achieve this same purpose. It remains to be seen whether Tesla will be successful in its research and whether it will become the first company to dominate the robotics market.
Fourth, Tesla's Shanghai Energy Storage Giga factory began production last February. The company intends to work with a single energy solutions operator that provides energy generation, storage and management services to complement the automotive, robotics, supercomputer and energy businesses. This objective requires extremely high standards for both software and hardware. Tensions between China and the United States could have consequences for the import and export of products, a factor that is beyond Tesla's control.
Fifth, the fact that Musk runs several AI companies makes his attention dispersed, and some of his public statements have had an impact on Tesla's image. The performance bonus he should have received for his work in 2018 is currently under appeal and it is not yet known whether the 2025 bonus will be approved by shareholders and the courts. These are all issues that Musk must consider.
In the $1 billion performance bonus plan, Musk embodies three essential qualities in a successful business tycoon. Firstly, his management of several companies demonstrates his dedication to his work and reveals effort and passion. Second, once you reach your goals, your Tesla shares will increase from 13 percent to 25 percent. By strengthening his control over the company, Musk can continue to develop the business and lead it into the next decade of prosperity, proving his commitment to future growth. Third, Musk has a deep sense of adventure and, by taking risks, creates great benefits for the company and for himself. Only by transforming Tesla into an unprecedented technological company will Musk be able to reap substantial rewards, linking his personal assets to the company's value in the long term.
Tesla's board of directors hopes that this plan will ensure Musk's focus on his project over the next decade, leading the company towards business transformation and profit growth. If the investigation is successful, Tesla could generate substantial profits.  Failure can nullify all investments and result in losses. Risk is the essence of business. Profits and losses are precisely the consequence of taking risks. Compared to the 8.5 billion that the company is worth and its 400 billion in profit, the 1 billion prize is just a drop in the ocean. It is not a significant amount for Tesla, but it unites the interests of the company, its shareholders and Musk, cementing a common destiny.
The success of Tesla's business means increased shareholder dividends, a rise in share value and a satisfied set of shareholders. However, some of them may be afraid that Musk will not meet all the objectives proposed by the company, and that as he has more shares, the participation in the capital of these shareholders will be diluted. This plan will make it more difficult for them to pass resolutions that secure their interests in the future. In this scenario, Tesla may become unable to do without Musk, some shareholders may feel he is indispensable, but Musk may leave when his goals are achieved.
We have to wait for the result of the Tesla shareholder meeting that will take place in November and see if Musk can create another legend in the business world.

We have become accustomed to reading sad news about children who steal their mother's jewelry for certain vices or who beat their mother or father because they don't give them money to buy drugs. Now the red line has been crossed. A minor says that “my mother bothered me a lot”, takes his father's gun and kills his mother without appeal or aggravation. What this has come to.
The mother, Susana Gravato, 49 years old, was a PSD councilor at the Vagos City Council. The court has already decided to commit the minor to a closed regime and he may then remain in the same situation for another three years. The minor committed the crime in such a conscious way that, after the act, he even simulated a robbery scenario at home. When we spoke to a psychologist, she told us that the change in children's education these days is terrifying. That social networks are one of the reasons why violence is becoming commonplace and that legislation needs to change a lot with regard to access to digital.
Miguel Sousa Tavares defended the gradual ban on social networks, stressing that “They are ruining our way of life”. We live in a time of education through conditioned reflex, added the psychologist, to continue highlighting "that perhaps because we are being overtaken by dogs. We live in a time where everything is the consequence of a pseudo-trauma that ignorance can easily treat and that does nothing but prolong and worsen the disease."
We read Freud very early on, and we soon realized that, in Freud, almost everything revolved around frustration and repressed sex. Then, as was fashionable, we read Piaget thinking it would help us educate our children. We were wrong. Piaget educated, but he taught us. We discovered that educating children is not limited to theories, religions or fashions. Raising children, first and foremost, must be an act of love, otherwise the reverse side of the coin could be fatal.
In fact, the country, once considered peaceful, was shocked to learn that a daughter tried to stab her father to death and gouge out his eyes to simply keep a house, and the next day, a 14-year-old son killed his mother with his father's hidden pistol because “his mother was boring with her schoolwork”. Right, that is to say that he immediately “killed” his father and killed himself too. Madness contaminates and so does evil. They are identical twins. The Portuguese did not want to believe that the red line had been crossed and that now children were killing their parents.
A few years ago, we met José Manuel Anes, who was president of the Criminal Security and Terrorism Observatory. A man experienced in all aspects of life, security, crime and espionage. We cannot understand what education Anes gave his daughter Ana, so that she tried to stab him to death and had the “courage” to go on social media to say that she tried to kill her father because he had collaborated with the Mossad.
It's incomprehensible from a daughter. José Manuel Anes had told us that the position he held was a risky one, that he was aware that one day he could be killed, but he certainly never imagined that this could happen at the hands of his own daughter Ana, who is already in prison and who confessed to the crime. Indeed, the world has changed, and for the worse in terms of the attitudes of the new generations. Parents' fault? Perhaps. However, it is still repugnant that a 53-year-old daughter takes a knife and tries to kill her father who gave her everything including an allowance until the day he was seriously attacked. What this has come to.
José Manuel Anes was attacked inside his own house. Five years ago, Anes was persecuted by his daughter, with death threats on social media. The daughter intended for her father to put ownership of a house in Costa de Caparica in her name. Daughter Ana Anes' theory was that she would be able to sell the house and raise the money, since she would be unemployed.
This is the motive behind the crime determined by the Judiciary Police investigation. Furthermore, it was because he feared that his daughter would carry out the threats that José Manuel Anes, aged 81, began living with his current wife in the house of one of her friends, in Lisbon. Anes had received a threatening message from his daughter before the day of the crime and the very next day she rang the door of the house where she was living and Anes opened it, thinking it was the delivery of a package. He was immediately thrown to the ground by his daughter, who then attacked him with several punches all over his body. Then, with a sharp object, he hit him on the head, legs, hands and abdomen, until, finally, he pressed both of his eyes with his fingers, leaving him unable to see. What a macabre scene: a daughter who tries to kill an 81-year-old father, just for the sake of money. On any given day, every month we have a father killed by a son. What this has come to…

Exaggerating the Russian threat serves both industry and domestic politics. At the lower end of the scale, Palestinians continue to be targets of extermination and displacement by Jerusalem, in a persistent search for living space. They are forgotten victims, especially by those who call themselves their friends. The crisis of social cohesion in the triangle of regional powers is evident. In Israel, internal fragmentation is dramatic. External wars function as an escape valve to avoid internal collapse between centrifugal tribes, where the retreat of ultra-Orthodox Jews to fight for the Zionists is more than alarming. In Iran, tension is latent, the result of the progressive secularization of society and the regime, which the West continues to attribute to the ayatollahs as a caricature that is not amusing, and the collapse of the birth rate.
In Türkiye, the situation is manageable, despite the growing gap between the regime's pragmatic Islamism and the secular, almost atheist, widespread among young people. The fertility rate fell from 2.38 children per woman in 2001 to 1.48 in 2024, a sign of a profound demographic transition. As for the triangle of great powers, the United States maintains interest only to avoid Israel's self-destruction, caused by unwinnable wars. But the commitment is decreasing. Trump does not trust Netanyahu, who tries to instrumentalize him, but depends on him for weapons. Israeli extravagances are tolerated, as the American interest lies in supervising the balance between the three protagonists, the United States, Russia and China in addition to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, converted to the open field game, with China and even Iran.
The red line of the Persian bomb, with Saudi and Turkish consequences, remains a point of tension. With no other perspective than to push everyone further. Russia has recently rediscovered its Soviet-era Middle Eastern partners, starting with Syria, trying to open a southwestern breach in the American device west of the vertical Murmansk-Cairo eastern border of the American sphere of influence in the post-global era. The fall of al-Assad dealt a severe blow to Russian influence in the region. Moscow is trying to defend access to its only naval base in the Mediterranean, reduced but not compromised. Putin strengthens military and energy ties with Iran, as the Ukrainians well know, the target of swarms of Persian drones, while negotiating with Saudi Arabia, together with the Americans, the price of oil. Erdogan extends his provinces to almost all of Libya, while offering ambiguous support in the Black Sea and in secret negotiations over Ukraine.
But the rivalry between the Second and Third Rome is destined to last until the last days. Finally, the strategic triangle between Israel, Turkey and Iran in the Middle East, between Suez, Bab al-Mandab and Hormuz, adds a layer of complexity to the global panorama. They are islands of strong identity in a sea of ​​para-States and fragmented communities, where stability is always relative. The war in Ukraine, far from being an isolated episode, is a mirror of a world in transition. A world where the balance between powers, the redefinition of alliances and the management of regional conflicts will determine the course of history. And where peace, more than an ideal, will be the result of patient and multilateral diplomatic engineering.</description><pubDate>2025-10-23 23:54:02</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC | Hu Jiawen exhibition to see from today</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/frc-exposicao-de-hu-jiawen-para-ver-a-partir-de-hoje/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) presents a new exhibition today. It is “Radiant Blue”, with works by Hu Jiawen, an artist who explores all her creativity in connection with the universe of Gongbi painting and other traditional Chinese painting techniques. To view until November 8th
The artist Hu Jiawen presents today, at the Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC), several of her painting works, in a new exhibition open until the 8th of November. This is “Radiant Blue”, with its opening scheduled for today, starting at 6:30 pm, where “the spectator is invited to immerse themselves in a world where the traditional and the contemporary coexist, through the dialogue between the calm lines of meticulous brushwork and the intense metallic burns, of blue paint and gold leaf”, highlights the FRC, in a statement.
This exhibition includes 30 works composed of Gongbi painting, traditional Chinese painting, experimental painting, contemporary painting, mixed media with metal foil, and bronze sculpture. Highlight is the “accurate selection” of works by the curator and renowned local artist, Chang Kuok Meng, in an exhibition organized by the FRC, the Macau Youth Art Association and the Macau Fine Arts Artists Association.
According to the organization's manifesto, this solo exhibition is an “exploration of visual art rooted in meticulous traditional figure painting, integrating experimental techniques of Indian ink, blue printing and gold leaf burning”. Here, “the artist reconstructs oriental aesthetics from traditional and contemporary perspectives, creating an environment of painting on silk and rice paper, which embodies both classical meaning and modern consciousness”.
Go beyond the usual
According to Hu Jiawen, “Radiant Blue” reveals the “effort to leave the comfort zone and go beyond the label of ‘Gongbi Figure Painting'”, where the artist “uses different means” to try to “transmit the emotions and status of women in virtual and in-person spaces, hoping that the public will appreciate the beauty that arises from imperfection and transformation”.
There are “female figures in the works that often exist in a space-time intertwined with reality and illusion”, showing “the delicate representation of meticulous brushwork”, or even “the transformative quality of experimental paint and the deep layers of blue printing”.
These “are further highlighted by the intervention of burnt gold leaf, in the sense that its cracks and imperfections do not mean damage, but rather give the figures character and a sense of temporal texture”. Then there is “the light and hue created by the burnt gold leaf that suggest the fusion of emotions and the impression of memories”.
Hu Jiawen has a bachelor's degree in Visual Arts Education from Macau Polytechnic University and a master's degree in Education from the University of Macau. Currently residing in the territory, she dedicates herself to artistic education and is employed by the Canton International Art Fair, in addition to performing other functions in various artistic organizations. His works have been exhibited in places such as Beijing, Guangzhou and Macau, receiving awards and being included in several collections. He is proficient in different genres, with a special talent for traditional Chinese painting, sketching, oil painting, engraving, ceramics, and fine brushstroke Gongbi figure painting.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:49:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Exhibition on intangible cultural heritage at the Macau Museum</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/mostra-sobre-patrimonio-cultural-intangivel-no-museu-de-macau/</link><description>A new exhibition on the intangible cultural heritage of the Greater Bay Area opens to the public this Saturday, entitled “A New Impulse – Cultivated Greater Bay Area, A Brilliant Intangible Cultural Heritage: Exhibition of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area”. The initiative can be seen at the Macau Museum until March 15th next year.
Organized with several museum entities in the province of Guangdong and Hong Kong, the exhibition “will encompass a thematic exhibition, interactive demonstrations of artisanal techniques, workshops and the sale of cultural and creative products related to intangible cultural heritage”.
The exhibition presents “more than 50 manifestations representative of the intangible cultural heritage of the Greater Bay Area, including Cantonese embroidery, colored paper crafts, wood carvings and Cantonese porcelain”.
The aim is, in this way, “to make the public aware of the artisanal techniques of the intangible cultural heritage in the traditional cultural context of Lingnan, as well as the oriental aesthetics formed through the fusion of Chinese and Western cultures, as evidenced in the intangible cultural heritage of the Greater Bay Area”.
The great interaction
In connection with the opening of this exhibition, there will be “interactive demonstrations of artisanal techniques” on the weekend, Saturday and Sunday, in places such as the Fortaleza do Monte garden and the Macau Museum. These demonstrations cover various arts, including Foshan Chinese New Year woodblock painting, Hakka qilin dancing from Hang Hau in Sai Kung, Portuguese tile making and painting, Portuguese folk dance and lion dance.
Also included are demonstrations of Wing Chun martial arts, Choi Lei Fat martial arts, Naamyam Narrative Songs, Taoist ritual music and Baatyam percussion. The entire program can be seen on the Macau Museum portal.
The workshops will also take place on the 1st and 2nd of November, at the Macau Museum, Casa do Mandarin and Zheng Guanying Memorial Museum, focusing on puppet theater for the whole family, creating bookmarks made with gold thread embroidery or even creating Cantonese opera accessories.
A highlight is the holding, this Saturday, of two guided tour sessions at the exhibition. The deadline for registering for some activities is Wednesday, which can be done on the Macau Single Account platform.
In addition to all the activities mentioned above, between Saturday and Monday, the sale of cultural and creative products related to intangible cultural heritage will take place in the garden of Fortaleza do Monte.

This is an event promoted by the Tourism Services Directorate (DST) that includes the “CreatorWeek Conference”, which takes place today at the Grand Lisboa Palace. Tomorrow, the “CreatorWeek Academy” takes place, in the same tourist resort.
According to a note from DST, these two events “aim to create a platform for content creators, companies and local groups producing new media and social media leaders”, with the hope that this platform “will provide commercial value”.
It is hoped that an event entirely dedicated to “influencer” activity can look at the “uniqueness” of Macau and “contribute to promoting the development, abroad, of creators from the interior of China”, in addition to also helping “international creators to enter China to get to know Chinese culture”. MGTO also hopes that this week will “elevate the image of Macau as an ‘internet-famous’ tourist city, promoting the development of the content creator economy”.
The “CreatorWeek Conference” takes place between 10 am and 6 pm and aims to debate “the cultural integration of Chinese and Western social networks and platform trends”, without forgetting “the current situation and the future of the creator economy”. The event features dozens of speakers, including, for example, Ben Wong, director of marketing operations at Google in China.
In turn, the “CreatorWeek Academy” takes place between 2pm and 5pm and “has the participation of talents from the sector and leaders from the main platforms”, discussing topics such as “From Local Voice to Global Influence”, “Agents, MCNs and Creators: Building Sustainable Careers” or “Creating a Community with Snapchat”, among many others.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 04:12:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Edition celebrating 15 years of Oktoberfest Macau has already started</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/27/edicao-que-celebra-os-15-anos-do-oktoberfest-macau-ja-arrancou/</link><description>Another edition of Oktoberfest Macau began on Friday, which until November 2nd takes place at MGM Cotai. According to a statement from the gaming operator, this is an edition that makes “a toast to 15 years” of the event that has brought to the territory “the authentic flavor and spirit of the iconic German beer festival”. Oktoberfest Macau has received, over 15 years, more than 190 thousand participants.
On Friday, at the opening ceremony, Kenneth Feng, president and CEO of MGM China, said that this party is “not only a celebration, but also a connection”.
"It is this feeling of togetherness that has sustained the spirit of the festival for the past fifteen years, making it an eagerly-awaited annual celebration, filled with laughter and memories. This year, the festival will welcome its 200,000th guest, a true milestone that reflects MGM's long-standing commitment to developing cultural and tourism products for Macau," he added.
Music and sausages
Anyone who goes to Oktoberfest can be sure that they will find the typical German beer and sausages that are the delights of the party, and this year the Högl Fun Band returns, directly from Munich. This group promises to “take the stage with lively Bavarian melodies, leading the audience in chorus with the song that is the original theme of the festival”, the song “Nei Hou, Macau!”.
In order to celebrate 15 years of existence, MGM created a “special photo booth” for this edition, so that participants can take themed photographs about Oktoberfest, in addition to the “Best Costume Award” debuting. Here, the public is invited “to dress up in themed costumes and fully embrace the spirit of Oktoberfest”. The space also offers activities designed for children.
The party takes place until November 2nd, from 6pm to midnight, on the first terrace of MGM Cotai, and tickets for the event must be purchased.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 04:10:34</pubDate></item><item><title>PJ | Indicted for kidnapping and rape of lover</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/pj-indiciado-por-sequestro-e-violacao-de-amante/</link><description>The Judiciary Police (PJ) announced the arrest of a 34-year-old man on suspicion of kidnapping, rape and serious harm to the physical integrity of his lover. The case took place in a local hotel, after the two began an extramarital relationship last year.
According to the PJ's version, the man and woman are from the interior, where they met and began a romantic relationship. However, the most recent meeting in Macau ended with the alleged commission of several crimes. After a meeting in a restaurant on Saturday morning, the woman was blackmailed into going to the man's hotel room in Macau. If she refused, the lover threatened to reveal the relationship to her husband and his entire family.
The woman eventually gave in, but when she arrived at the hotel room she was raped and kidnapped for at least an hour. After the first attack, the woman contacted her sister to ask for help and ended up being attacked, with an ashtray on her head, in addition to being strangled with a cell phone charger cable.
Given his injuries, the man allowed the victim to contact his sister, who in turn alerted the police. The suspect ended up being detained by the authorities, and when questioned by the authorities he asserted his right to silence.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:45:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Light Rail | Only two in every 100 young people use transport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/metro-ligeiro-apenas-dois-em-cada-100-jovens-utilizam-transporte/</link><description>Poor network coverage and the distance to residential areas mean that young people rarely use the metro. Among users, the main reason is the desire to have a different experience
Only 1.5 percent of young people in Macau say they use the Light Rail as their main means of transport, that is, less than two out of every 100 young people. The conclusion is part of the study prepared by the New Chinese Youth Association of Macau, the results of which were presented yesterday.
Based on a survey in which 647 young residents were questioned, aged between 18 and 44, the association concluded that the Light Rail is the least used means of transport of all those available in the territory.
When asked to answer about the main means of transport in Macau, around 36.6 percent of respondents admitted that they mainly use buses. Private vehicles, such as cars or motorcycles, were indicated as the main means of travel for 31.9 percent of young people, while 26.3 percent responded that they traveled mainly on foot. Only 1.5 percent of those questioned indicated the metro as their main means of transport.
Despite not being the main means of transport, 58.7 percent said they had used the metro at least once in the last year. However, almost seven in ten (68.4 percent) of these respondents were infrequent users, using every three months or less regularly.
The Light Rail is still considered by users as “an experience” more than a form of transport that responds to everyday needs. Regarding the reason that led young people to choose the metro, 33.9 percent said that using it was justified “just by the experience”, while 22.1 percent said they would go to a border, and 21.3 percent said they would go to large hotels.
Does not heat up or cool down
Regarding the quality of the service, the largest group of young users are indifferent, with 39.3 percent responding that it is “neither good nor bad”. Conversely, 39.1 percent stated that satisfaction is “good or very good”. The results presented by the association do not allow us to know the total degree of dissatisfaction, however, there were also 14.2 percent of respondents who indicated that the experience on the metro was “not satisfactory” or “not very satisfying”
Among young people who do not use the metro, 46.1 percent cited the fact that the “stations are too far from their homes” as the main reason, while 35.6 percent justified their non-use due to limited network coverage and 33.3 percent indicated that the metro does not provide direct access to the places they frequent most.
One of the factors that also contributes to keeping young people away is the fact that payments made through applications that use QR technology are not accepted. Around 61.7 percent stated that due to this reason they feel less desire to use this transport.
Currently, the Light Metro can be used by purchasing a ticket at ticket machines, which do not accept QR Code technology, but also at physical ticket offices. Os interessados podem também utilizar o Macau Pass, passando directamente nos torniquetes de acesso.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:43:30</pubDate></item><item><title>HK | Smuggling case worth 200 million dollars discovered</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/contrabando-sete-casos-na-semana-passada/</link><description>Shark fins, cigars, cell phones, pharmaceutical products and even donkey skin. These are the products discovered in two more smuggling cases discovered by the Hong Kong Customs Service (SA) on the 3rd and 7th of this month.
According to a statement from this organization, the value of the goods is around 200 million US dollars, with two ships involved, one of them destined for river trade. This ship was destined for Macau and was caught by the authorities on October 3rd. Five containers destined for Taiwan were also inspected and were declared to be transporting frozen food. On October 7, the SA in Hong Kong realized that 150 tons of donkey skin were circulating here and not the declared food.
The same statement indicates that the investigation continues and that “the possibility of arrests is not excluded”. Under Hong Kong's Import and Export Law, anyone found guilty of importing or exporting undeclared cargo is subject to a maximum fine of US$2 million and a seven-year prison sentence upon conviction.
Seven cases last week
Taking into account the holding of the National Games starting next month, the Customs Service (SA) wants to show service and admitted to having reinforced inspection efforts at the Portas do Cerco Border Post. As a result of these efforts, seven cases of smuggling were recorded between 21 and 25 October.
According to a statement from the SA of Macau, within the scope of the seven cases, customs agents found a total of 120 old cell phones, often used to circumvent internet access limitations, 85 pieces of electronic products and 1344 grams of cigar.
The smugglers involved residents of Macau and the Interior, aged between 38 and 64. Those involved were fined, the SA announced, under the provisions of the foreign trade law.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Courts | Departure of Portuguese judge confirmed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/tribunais-saida-de-juiz-portugues-confirmada/</link><description>Judge Rui Ribeiro will leave the Macao SAR courts starting next month. The information had been made public by Lusa, which cited the judge himself as a source, and was confirmed yesterday through an order, published in the Official Bulletin.
“Judge Rui Carlos dos Santos Pereira Ribeiro is dismissed, at his request, from the position of judge of the Court of Second Instance of the Special Administrative Region of Macau […] from November 1, 2025”, the document reads.
According to the news agency, Rui Ribeiro asked to return to Portugal, due to uncertainty about authorization from the Portuguese Superior Council of Judiciary (CSM) to continue in the Macao SAR. The judge has been in Macau since September 1, 2008, and in Portugal he is part of the Civil Section of the Court of Appeal of Guimarães.
Last week, the president of the CSM, João Cura Mariano, showed his willingness to send more judges to Macau, despite admitting that there is also a lack of human resources in Portugal
With Rui Ribeiro's departure, there is only one Portuguese judge left in Macau, Jerónimo Alberto Gonçalves Santos, who serves as president of a collective court at the Base Judicial Court (TJB). Jerónimo Santos has been in the Macao SAR courts since September 1, 2005, being part of the Intellectual Property, Competition, Regulation and Supervision section of the Lisbon Court of Appeal in Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:40:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Great Bay | Projected salary increases of 3% in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/grande-baia-projeccao-de-aumentos-salariais-de-3-em-macau/</link><description>In the most recent Greater Bay Area Remuneration and Benefits Survey Report 2025, 15.4 percent of 39 companies in Macau point to a salary increase of around 3 percent for 2026. The technology area is the one that pays the most to a recent graduate, with a salary of 19 thousand patacas
Some data on the salary panorama and benefits granted to workers in the context of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area 2025 are now known, thanks to a new survey released on Friday.
According to an official statement, Macau is represented by 39 companies surveyed, of which 15.4 percent expect a salary increase of three percent for next year. Meanwhile, there are “33 organizations that have not yet decided on expected salary increases”, and “no organization has indicated a salary freeze”.
Forecasts for 2026 point to a salary adjustment of 3.1 percent in management or senior positions, supervisory positions or general staff, while employees in operational or customer service roles may receive increases of 3 percent. These are nicer numbers compared to this year, whose increase percentages are around 1.3 percent and 2.9 percent depending on the different professional positions. In 2022, the year of the pandemic, salary adjustments did not exceed 1 percent, and in senior or management personnel positions there was even a drop of 0.1 percent.
Between the months of July 2024 and June 2025, there was an average salary increase of 1.6 percent in the 39 companies surveyed in Macau, while 24 reported a salary freeze. Excluding these companies that did not increase values, “the real average salary increase was, in general terms, in the remaining organizations, 3.4 percent”.
These data refer to the 2025 Greater Bay Area Remuneration and Benefits Survey Report, which in the case of Macau includes companies linked to six sectors of activity, namely hotels and restaurants, banking, insurance, finance, culture and entertainment, or even commerce and engineering. The survey covered a total of 54,195 employees in Macau.
Who pays more?
The presentation of the Survey took place last Friday at the Faculty of Business Administration of the University of Macau (UM), and was carried out by this university, the Human Resources Association of the Greater Bay Area of ​​Macau and several higher education institutions in the Greater Bay Area, including the Human Resources Strategy and Development Center of the Faculty of Administration of the Hong Kong Baptist University, among others.
Still in the case of Macau, it is highlighted that graduates in the area of ​​information technology are those with the highest salary at the beginning of their careers, in the order of 19 thousand patacas, while in Guangdong province, for the same type of work, a recent graduate earns around 6 thousand renminbis. If you have more advanced studies, such as a postgraduate degree or master's degree, the salary increases to 8,500 renminbis. In Guangdong province, the highest salaries for a recent graduate are in the area of ​​“R&amp;D”, research and development of new products, with 6,500 renminbi. Those with more advanced studies than a bachelor's degree can reach a salary of 9,500 renimbis.
In the case of Hong Kong, salaries for those just leaving university are higher in the engineering field, paying an average of 21,500 Hong Kong dollars currently.
The survey was carried out in June this year among more than three thousand companies in the Greater Bay Area, and between the months of July and September 258 valid questionnaires were received: 39 from Macao SAR, 141 from Guangdong province and 78 from Hong Kong. In total, they cover 244 thousand employees who participated through an individualized panel system using artificial intelligence, entitled “My AI Salary Consultant”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:39:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Black Sand | Car enters restaurant and leaves six injured</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/27/areia-preta-carro-entra-dentro-de-restaurante-e-faz-seis-feridos/</link><description>An out-of-control Lamborghini entered the window of a restaurant in Areia Preta, leaving six people injured. The case happened on Saturday afternoon, and the injured, including the driver, customers and restaurant workers, were considered by authorities to be in a “stable” situation.
According to the report in the newspaper Ou Mun, the 60-year-old driver claimed to have made a mistake by pressing the accelerator pedal instead of the brake, which led to him losing control of the vehicle. The balloon test indicated that the driver had not consumed alcohol. In turn, the restaurant owner complained about the damage caused and also about the impossibility of continuing to operate the business in the near future, due to the need for major works. Authorities indicted the driver for causing physical harm through negligence, punishable by up to two years in prison.
Alcohol | Driver detained for causing accident
A 50-year-old man was arrested after causing an accident while driving drunk, with a level of 1.71 grams of alcohol per liter of blood. The case was revealed on Saturday, although the accident had happened on Wednesday morning.
The accident was declared when authorities were called to Avenida Doutor Henry Fok, due to a rear-end collision between a light vehicle and another. However, at the scene, authorities suspected that one of the drivers had consumed alcoholic beverages, so they carried out a balloon test, which showed a result of 1.71 grams of alcohol per liter of blood.
The man confessed to drinking alcohol, reporting that he had been drinking at work that morning. At the same time, he explained that he had been responsible for the accident, for not having maintained an appropriate safe distance.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 04:06:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism | Best September ever since there are records</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/27/turismo-melhor-setembro-de-sempre-desde-que-ha-registos/</link><description>Despite last month's record, when the nine months of the year are considered, the number of visitors is still below what happened between January and September 2019, before the pandemic.
Macau received almost 2.8 million visitors in September, 9.8 percent more than in the same period in 2024 and the highest figure ever for this month, it was announced Friday. The number of tourists passing through the territory was the highest for any month of September since the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) began compiling monthly data, in 1998, still during the Portuguese administration.
However, more than 56 percent of visitors (1.56 million) arrived on organized tours and spent less than a day in the Macao SAR. In 2024, the Central Government announced a series of measures to support Macau, such as increasing the tax exemption limit for goods for personal use purchased by visitors from China.
At the same time, the Chinese authorities expanded the list of places with “individual visas” to visit Hong Kong and Macau to 10 more cities in China. Furthermore, since January 1st, residents of the neighboring city of Zhuhai can visit Macau once a week and stay for up to seven days.
As a result, the overwhelming majority (90.6 percent) of tourists arriving in Macau in September came from mainland China or Hong Kong, while fewer than 260,400 were international visitors. The city received a total of almost 29.7 million visitors in the first ten months, 14.5 percent more than in the same period in 2024 and the second highest figure ever for the start of a year.
Exceptional numbers
According to official data, the number of tourists passing through Macau was only surpassed between January and September 2019 – before the Covid-19 pandemic -, a period in which it registered more than 30.2 million visitors. On January 17, the director of Macau Tourism Services said she expected between 38 and 39 million visitors this year. In August, Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes set a goal of more than three million international visitors by 2025.
In the first nine months of the year, Macau received almost 1.9 million tourists from abroad, 12.4 percent more than in the same period in 2024. Citizens of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman began to be exempt from visas to enter the city from July 16th.
Despite the increase in the number of tourists, the average consumption of each visitor in Macau, excluding casinos, fell 12.3 percent in the second quarter of the year, compared to the same period in 2024. In early May, DSEC pointed to the “change in the consumption pattern of visitors” as one of the main reasons for the 1.3 percent drop in Macau's economy between January and March.
It was the first time that the territory's Gross Domestic Product shrank, in year-on-year terms, since the end of 2022, when the region began to lift restrictions due to the covid-19 pandemic. Macau received 34.9 million visitors last year, 23.8 percent more than the previous year, but still far from the record, 39.4 million, set in 2019, before the pandemic.</description><pubDate>2025-10-27 04:05:19</pubDate></item><item><title>ZELENSKY VS ZELENSKY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.
 
10/28/22
At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke at length and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. It says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no such thing as chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is usually used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in others. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this error. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who didn't love anyone./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria stayed with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely outside our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J. Pinto Fernandes emerges at the exact moment when we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but this only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows everyone else and the joy of recognizing that the yardstick of the world is not measured with my short measure and that, on the contrary, it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican for writers from the north, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thought about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché “all different, all equal”, a return to “diplomacy”, given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that “we are unified because we share the same nature” but simply highlights that we “still do not share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that quenches your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and impressive, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unresponsive to reins and containment.
Men should refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish because of it, tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the land will be destroyed. pride of countries.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert”.
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that muzzle, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relationships were limited, or if it simply lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, declared in the presumption of each one. to be, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Obviously, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as a hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the position of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, deferred, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE

Helahoho! helahoho!
The poor widow's sewing machine who was bayoneted...
She sewed indefinitely in the afternoon…

And that poor instrument of peace stuck a spear in my heart.
Yes, I was the one to blame for everything, I was the soldier for them all
Who killed, raped, burned and broke,

And a physical fear of being accountable to God makes me close my eyes.

I let the daughters of all fathers tied to trees be raped,

What is clear today, at this disastrous moment in which Cristiano &amp; Companhia failed in their mission in Braga, and in which the self-sabotage of Russia's gas pipelines reminds us that Putin will indeed be willing to do anything to maintain dominance over the areas endorsed,

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun declared, at a press conference, that Beijing “has always developed ties with Berlin from a strategic and long-term perspective”.
Guo stressed that, as “large countries and leading world economies”, China and Germany maintain a “mutually beneficial” cooperative relationship. “Under the current circumstances, both parties must continue to push their ties in the right direction,” he added.
The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed last week the postponement of Johann Wadephul's visit, scheduled for October 28th and 29th, after the Chinese side did not confirm further meetings beyond the meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.
German diplomacy spokeswoman Kathrin Deschauer expressed Berlin's “great concern” about the restrictions imposed by Beijing on the export of certain components used in the production of semiconductors and rare earth materials, measures that raised alarm in the German automotive industry.
Trade tensions between the two countries intensified after the intervention of the Dutch State in the chip manufacturer Nexperia, a subsidiary of the Chinese Wingtech, which led Beijing to restrict exports of crucial components for the sector. The ban is generating concern among the Volkswagen Group, Europe's largest car manufacturer.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 02:07:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Trump wants to make a good deal with China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/diplomacia-trump-quer-realizar-um-bom-acordo-com-a-china/</link><description>The President of the United States, Donald Trump, stated yesterday that he hopes to “reach a good agreement” during the next meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, including a pact related to the TikTok platform, according to the international press.
Trump declared, aboard Air Force One, that TikTok will be one of the topics he will discuss with Xi during the meeting, scheduled for this Thursday, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which will take place in the South Korean city of Gyeongju, according to the EFE news agency. According to the US President, the agreement, signed between Washington and the parent company of the popular video platform, the Chinese ByteDance, already has Xi's “provisional approval”.
In September, the United States reached an agreement with Beijing-backed ByteDance to allow TikTok to continue operating on North American soil, after the US Congress established in 2024 that the application should be deactivated due to the risk it posed to the country's national security.
The pact establishes the creation of a mostly North American joint venture, with an operation sufficiently separate from its Chinese parent company — which will maintain a 20 percent stake —, especially with regard to the Chinese Government's access to servers that store user data.
The face-to-face meeting between the two leaders will provide an opportunity for both powers to ease tensions following Beijing's announcement of restrictions on the sale of its rare earths and to discuss a possible comprehensive trade agreement after months of tariff tensions.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 02:06:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Myanmar | Guterres wants “an end to impunity” for the military government</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/myanmar-guterres-quer-fim-da-impunidade-do-governo-militar/</link><description>UN Secretary-General António Guterres argued yesterday that “the cycle of impunity” in Myanmar must end, speaking in Kuala Lumpur, where he is participating in the summit of leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and allied countries.
"I am appalled by the deplorable situation in Burma [former name of Myanmar]. The 2021 military coup piled calamity upon calamity. Villages bombed or burned. Thousands dead. Millions displaced. Regional stability is at risk," warned Guterres, adding that "atrocities and the cycle of impunity must end."
Calling for an immediate end to the violence, the UN leader stated that there must be “a genuine commitment to inclusive dialogue” and a return to civilian government, “starting with the rapid release of all those who have been arbitrarily detained”.
The military junta that has held power in Myanmar since the February 2021 coup announced last July that it would hold elections in December, but the lack of real opposition, with many pro-democracy politicians in exile or in prison, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, means that a large part of the international community considers that the vote will be a sham.
Since the military coup against the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar has been immersed in turmoil, with an armed rebellion taking control of large areas of the territory. “The path forward must lead to the restoration of democratic institutions anchored in the rule of law and human rights”, considered Guterres, admitting that he believes that “no one thinks that these elections will be free and fair”.
Peace and ASEAN
The United Nations secretary-general supported a peace plan drawn up in 2021 by ASEAN to end hostilities and begin dialogue, which the military government has ignored. “It is time to open humanitarian channels, end the violence and facilitate a comprehensive political solution,” he said.
“The people of Myanmar count on our collective support,” he added. The UN Secretary General's statements were made during a press conference in the capital of Malaysia, where the summit of leaders of ASEAN and allied countries began on Sunday. The summit will last until Tuesday and will be attended, in addition to the leaders of countries in the region, by the President of the USA, Donald Trump, the Brazilian Prime Minister, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and the Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, among others.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 02:05:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Pyongyang | Trump would love to meet Kim Jong-un</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/pyongyang-trump-adoraria-encontrar-se-com-kim-jong-un/</link><description>North American President Donald Trump reiterated yesterday that he would love to meet the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, during his trip to the Asian continent this week.

Several of Timor-Leste's partners highlighted the country's “great achievement” with its accession, on Sunday, to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which will allow it to strengthen its regional integration. “Yesterday’s announcement [Sunday] in Malaysia is a monumental achievement and the result of many years of hard work on the part of the Government of Timor-Leste, ASEAN countries and their partners”, said the Australian embassy yesterday, in a post on social media.
Timor-Leste completed its accession to ASEAN on Sunday with the signing ceremony of the declaration of admission by the Timorese Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmão. The document was then delivered to the organization's secretary general, Kao Kim Hourn, by the head of the Government of Timor-Leste, accompanied by President José Ramos-Horta.
On Sunday, in a speech given at the ASEAN heads of state and government summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the president of the European Council, António Costa, congratulated Timor-Leste on its accession, considering it an “important milestone to promote the country's economic and political interdependence” and to “strengthen regional integration”.
Full group
The European Union's representation at ASEAN also highlighted, on social media, the support given by the European organization to Timor-Leste through capacity building, trade support, institutional strengthening, among others. “Today, ASEAN is complete, geographically and politically, and Timor-Leste gains new opportunities for regional inclusion and deeper economic integration”, reads a post on social media.
The United States, through Secretary of State Mark Rubio, also congratulated Timor-Leste on its “historic” membership as the 11th member of ASEAN, highlighting that “it represents an important step in the ongoing search for regional integration and cooperation”. “The United States maintains its commitment to the centrality of ASEAN and supports Timor-Leste’s efforts in the integration process,” he added.
The UN also congratulated Timor-Leste on the “historic moment”, as well as the resident mission of the Asian Development Bank, which highlighted that membership “opens new horizons of growth, unity and progress in Southeast Asia”. ASEAN was created in 1967 by Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, and was later joined by Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and since Sunday by Timor-Leste.

According to data released by the National Statistics Office (GNE), the indicator registered a growth of 21.6 percent in September alone, compared to the same period of the previous year.
If the trend continues, Chinese industrial companies could finally reverse the negative cycle of the last three years, in which profits fell by 2 percent in 2022, 2.3 percent in 2023 and 3.3 percent in 2024. Between January and September, the profits of the analyzed companies totaled 5.37 billion yuan, according to the GNE.

According to the local press, Lukas Ho Cheuk-wai, 41, considered the mastermind of the attacks, having made the site available and purchased the materials needed to manufacture explosives, was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The same court of first instance sentenced Lee Ka-pan, 31, and Cheung Ka-chun, 35, to 16 years and eight months in prison.
In handing down the sentence, Judge Johnny Chan Jong-herng recalled that the trio had successfully carried out two initial attacks without causing any casualties, and said that the accused had shown little remorse during the trial. The judge described the defendants' acts as a declaration of war against society and said that the sentence must be heavy enough to deter further similar acts.
In early September, a jury, made up of seven women and two men, found the defendants guilty of “conspiracy to cause an explosion of a nature likely to endanger life or cause serious damage to property”. The three defendants could have been sentenced to a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, according to a law approved in colonial times.
Planned explosions
At the end of the trial, which lasted almost half a year, all seven defendants had been acquitted of involvement in terrorist activities, a charge that could carry a sentence of life in prison. According to the indictment, the group attempted to manufacture explosives to plant bombs, between November 2019 and March 2020, in several locations in the city, including a medical center and a metro station.
In July 2021, police said the defendants planned to use the material to bomb courts, tunnels, railways and blow up rubbish bins in the street, “to maximize the damage caused to society”.

A high-level Chinese delegation will be in Brussels this week to talk to the European Union (EU) after tightening controls on rare earth exports from China, Brussels announced yesterday, calling on Beijing to be “a responsible partner”.
"Regarding the engagement that will take place this week between the EU and China, what [European Trade Commissioner Maros] Sefcovic confirmed last week was that [China's Trade] Minister Wang [Wentao] agreed to hold a high-level dialogue at technical level this week. I can confirm that this is happening," said European Commission spokesperson for the trust, Olof Gill.
Speaking at the institution's daily press conference in Brussels, the Commerce spokesperson explained that “the first meetings are already taking place today (yesterday), via videoconference, to prepare the ground” and “the high-level Chinese technical delegation will arrive in Brussels on Thursday to address these issues in a substantial way”.
"I think it's worth remembering why we are taking these measures. We are acting because we believe that China should behave as a responsible partner", said Olof Gill. The official admitted that “this problem is not new”, with the EU “trying to face the global problem that China has caused with its export restrictions and other worrying measures”.
On the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Malaysia, the president of the European Council, António Costa, met with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang, calling for “constructive and stable relations” between the EU and China and “concrete progress” to rebalance trade and economic relations.
"I shared my strong concern about the expansion of controls on the export of critical raw materials and related goods and technologies by China. I urged it to re-establish, as quickly as possible, fluid, reliable and predictable supply chains", said António Costa, in a statement released to the press in Brussels.
The European Commission has been reporting concerns from the EU industry, particularly automotive, due to the tightening of controls on exports of rare earths by China, which could affect supply chains, and is in contact with the Chinese authorities.
Security concerned
China announced new restrictions on the export of rare earths, expanding control to five more elements – holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium -, bringing the number of metals under supervision to 12. The measures impose mandatory licenses not only for the export of materials, but also for associated technologies and services, such as casting, recycling and manufacturing of magnetic magnets.
The Chinese Government justifies these actions on national security grounds, claiming that rare earths have civil and military uses, and prohibits exports destined for sensitive sectors or entities under sanctions. Part of the rules have already come into force and the rest will be applied from December 1, 2025, including controls on foreign products containing rare earths of Chinese origin.
These measures reinforce China's role as a dominant power in the global market for critical materials, raising concerns about international dependence and potential geopolitical repercussions. The European Commission is responsible for EU trade policy. Last week, the president of the community executive, Ursula von der Leyen, asked the EU to avoid “new and dangerous dependencies” on China’s rare earths, which could become “instruments of pressure”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:50:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Cuca Roseta, fado singer: “Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/cuca-roseta-fadista-o-fado-e-um-samba-poesia-cantado-vindo-do-coracao/</link><description>During the pandemic, she sang for the Macau public through a video concert, but now, the fado singer gives her heart and soul to a concert with the Macau Chinese Orchestra, part of the lineup for the Macau International Music Festival, next Saturday, 11th. In an interview with HM, Cuca Roseta talks about the show's lineup, her 15-year career and the truth found in her compositions.
Performs in Macau on October 11th with the Macau Chinese Orchestra (OCM). Tell me a little about what we can expect from this show.
Yes, we are finally going to Macau. It will be the first time because we previously did a video concert for Macau during the pandemic, and we were unable to be there physically. We now work with OCM, which is very good, and I am happy with this partnership, for being able to unite, in some way, two cultures. We are a little anxious about that fact.
The concert will have songs such as “Meu”, “Preto e Branco”, “Canção do Mar”, “Não Sei de Onde” and “Finalmente”. What does this alignment bring us?
We already had arrangements made for orchestra by Marinho de Freitas, which are extraordinary arrangements, and which will be adapted to the traditional OCM instruments. These songs are practically all written by me, lyrics and music, and tell different stories, some that I have lived myself or stories that, in some way, I have experienced someone living very closely. They are original fados. “Canção do Mar” is very old and became known in the voices of Dulce Pontes and Amália Rodrigues, and has a new arrangement. We thought it would look beautiful with OCM. Of course, there are songs that we always sing and that never leave the repertoire, linked to traditional phases of my career. There are some songs that people like and request, but we bring a completely different repertoire to what we presented at the time [in Macau, with the video concert], which was very well received. It was a concert that went very well, even though it was via video, and we received wonderful messages.
This year he released the album “Até a Fé Se Esqueceu”, which has an exclusively Brazilian repertoire, with several names in Brazilian music, such as Seu Jorge or Zeca Pagodinho. Why explore this universe, mixing it with the language of Fado?
Yes, but this year I will also release a French album with Amália Rodrigues' agent, who invited me. But “Até a Fé Se Esqueceu” came from an invitation from a great Brazilian producer to record old sambas, which have a lot to do with Fado. Even though it's a Brazilian album, all sambas, it's my saddest album of all, the most melancholic. That's why we went looking for this root of samba to find great poets and great composers that Brazil has, and who have this weight that Fado also has.
As?
Fado has a lot to do with words and composition, in fact, Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart, because there has to be this truth in the interpretation, the idea of ​​truth coming from life's experiences, in transforming the story it tells. This melancholy is in the veins of Portuguese blood and is mixed with art and music. This invitation wanted to put a fado singer to sing seriously and with the weight that Fado brings, and be able to interpret the great poets and sambas. The album [Até a Fé Se Esqueceu] has very old sambas, one of them from 1937. It is, therefore, a very strong and even very beautiful album, with great poems and composers, such as Tom Jobim, Vinicius de Morais, and wonderful partnerships with Seu Jorge and Zeca Pagodinho, who came to Fado. It's an album that made me really proud.

Therefore, it is possible to marry Fado with the joy of samba, which also has a melancholic side, right? Like the melancholy of our Fado.
In fact, when we hear the word samba we think of joy, but in fact the basis of samba is not joy. There is that phrase by Vinicius de Morais, “To make a samba beautifully you need a bit of sadness, otherwise you won’t make a samba”. So that's where the beauty of this work lies, which goes to the roots of samba and shows that there aren't that many differences between the melancholy at the root of samba and the melancholy of Fado. It's a nostalgic and melancholic album, it doesn't bring that joy. It can bring hope, and we can say that some themes bring with them this hope, which we find in Brazilian culture and drums. Because they literally put their sadness on the skirt wheel and on the drums, right? They transform sadness into dance and music, but in this work we don't see that type of samba.
Cuca also has a previous album, “Cabo Verde Nha Cretcheu”, so it can be said that she has explored, in her career, the different Portuguese-speaking sounds, going beyond Fado, mixing sounds?
This album didn't come from my will, and I think [it's a sign] that life takes me, deep down. This album was born from a tour I took across the nine islands of Cape Verde with a live recording of the mornas I sang on each island, as I sang the traditional mornas of each island. Between one island and another there are very different moraines. What I did was, after my Fado concerts, I sang two mornas and then we compiled all the songs in Creole in celebration of the fact that I was the first international artist to do the nine islands in a row. But I was also in Goa and did my concert in Concanim. I find it easy and enjoy learning the traditional songs of the countries where I am going to sing. I already sang in Moscow and learned a Russian song; I learned the songs of Goa, and in Georgia, in Tblisi, I also learned a song. It's a treat I make when I travel around the world taking Fado. But morna is wonderful and there really are similarities between this musical genre, and I wanted to bring this encounter between Fado and morna to Cape Verdeans, and this album came about, which is beautiful.
Once it goes to Macau, can we expect a song in Cantonese, or Mandarin?
Yes. By chance, I had already spoken to my manager to contact someone in this regard, so that we could discover a traditional song that I could learn.
Last year, he celebrated 15 years of career. How do you review your career, which began with the albums “Cuca Roseta” and “Raiz”?
In fact, it was great to celebrate 15 years at MEO Arena [the concert hall in Lisbon], and be able to revisit all the albums since the first. “Raiz” opened something that is rarer, which is the fado singer composing and writing her lyrics. This was a record that went wonderfully well and, from then on, it was good, because in this search for the truth that Fado has, being able to compose and write your own lyrics always means giving a little more of yourself. Each person composes and writes in their own way, and when they can do it, it is always a bit like the lines on the palm of their hand, that is, it is something unique. In this search that people make to follow standards to achieve success, I believe that success exists when we are not afraid to follow our voice and our instinct, what comes from our heart, tell our stories and sing our melodies without fear. In this way we end up becoming unique. Although it is not usual in Fado for a fado singer to compose and write, it was nice to see that my songs became important to many fans. Sometimes I have great composers and poets [to collaborate with me], but I think [writing and composing] brings out this side of the person being more truthful. My poems can never be compared to those of the great poets I have sung, but I think people feel that I am more in my own skin. In a way, this touches and moves them. Celebrating 15 years of career was the closing of a cycle and the beginning of another, and it was great to return to the “roots”, and realize that that was where the “gunpowder” lay, in the sense of not being afraid of ourselves.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:24:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Hui So-ying, protagonist of the film “Ah Ying”: “Representing is being human”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/30/hui-so-ying-protagonista-do-filme-ah-ying-representar-e-ser-se-humano/</link><description>In 1983, Hong Kong cinema, through the lens of Allen Fong, revealed “Ah Ying”, a film that portrays the hard life of a girl who sells fish in the market and dreams of becoming an actress. That girl was Hui So-ying and “Ah Ying” was inspired by her life. HM spoke to the actress on the sidelines of “Making Waves – 2nd Hong Kong Cinema Exhibition”, which took place this weekend in Lisbon
 
How did you get involved in this film project?
The main reason I got involved in this film was because my theater teacher passed away. So I felt like I needed to do something to honor him, because he was the one who taught me how to act. So I tried to be an actress. Later, when [director] Allen Fong met me, he found my life story interesting, and he also ended up meeting some of my family members. Then he asked if they were also interested in participating in the film, which led to many of them also ending up joining the project. The film also shows the environment in which my teacher lived, it is a portrait of experiences and stories lived by me and my teacher.
The film portrays life in Hong Kong in those times. How did you prepare for the character?
The beauty of this film is closely related to the collaborations that were made, particularly in photography and costumes. It took many collaborations to create the beauty that exists in the film. It was hard work taking on the character [of Ah Ying], because the story was designed to describe some of my past experiences, and that's what the director wanted to do. But that was difficult for me, because there were some things I didn't want to face, but I had to. Of course, I later realized that, deep down, it was nothing, and I even felt relieved after finishing filming. Thinking about whether the story was a form of art or reality, when I was performing, I had to enter the situation of the moment because, in fact, the [real] episode had already passed, but I had to have certain feelings again during the performance. As an actress, it was a big test.
“Ah Ying” is considered one of the great films of the so-called “New Wave” of Hong Kong cinema. During the screening, did you expect the film to be successful?
I didn't think about it, but throughout the project I thought that Allen Fong was a very daring director, because a film of this kind had never been made in the entire history of Hong Kong cinema. It's a kind of “docudrama”, and he had the strength and courage to innovate the way he filmed it, which, at the time, was unprecedented.
What was the biggest challenge you faced in this film?
It was having to return to my old self. There were things I didn't want to face and I had to face them again, with the same feeling I had at that time.
Many years have passed between 1983 and the present. Looking back, what meaning did this film have for you, as a person and actress?
In fact, after seeing the film, I saw it as just a story. For me, acting is being human, every day is a performance.
The film portrays life in Hong Kong in the 1980s and has received a restored version. What do you think this project can bring to a younger audience watching the film today?
This year the film was shown several times, and I always ask the same question, whether people don't understand the film or whether they think it can't be immersive enough. In fact, given my experience, most younger viewers responded that this is not the case, that the film is quite real. I don't think this film is outdated or out of fashion just because times have progressed or society has changed. I don't think so.
“Ah Ying” closed, in Lisbon, the second edition of “Making Waves – Hong Kong Film Festival”. How do you feel about seeing this film shown in Portugal?
I found it interesting. I never thought that the film could be shown at this exhibition, I don't know if it was because there was a restored copy. Before this new version it was more difficult to display it. The public can see a film that shows family relationships experienced in the 80s, and I think that the film can be immersive [in the theme], when it addresses family conflicts, because everyone has a family. Watching the film, you may wonder what your relationship with your family is like. Of course, I also hope you learned more about Hong Kong. But, despite this film taking place in the 80s, it focuses a lot on family and interpersonal relationships.
Is there an episode from filming that left an impression on you?
There were several moments throughout the film, but the one that left the biggest impression on me was the last scene, in the interview, in which I was talking to a chair, but it was as if I were talking to my teacher. When I see this scene again I am always moved, because my teacher has already passed away, but all of this still makes a huge impression on me.</description><pubDate>2025-09-30 00:42:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Jorge Figueira, architect and academic at the University of Coimbra: “The heroic relationships” of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/jorge-figueira-arquitecto-e-academico-da-universidade-de-coimbra-as-relacoes-heroicas-de-macau/</link><description>He has been writing and thinking about architecture for a long time, and Jorge Figueira, architect and academic at the University of Coimbra, has been doing so in Macau since then. After a session this week in which he highlighted the former Fai Chi Kei public housing complex, by Manuel Vicente, Jorge Figueira addresses the legacy of Nuno Portas today at the Rui Cunha Foundation
 
Participate today in the conference “Nuno Portas: from Architecture to Urbanism, from Man to City”. What legacy did this Portuguese architect leave?
Nuno Portas is someone who, at the end of the 50s, had a critical activity that was completely innovative and pioneering in the Portuguese context. Then, in the 60s, he had a more international activity, having been the first to publicize the work of Siza Vieira. It was there that he had his first contacts with Spanish and Italian architects, mainly. During those years he also wrote two books that were also unusual, such as “Architecture for Today”, in 1964, and “City as Architecture”, in 1969. They were also an extraordinary way of trying to understand what was happening in terms of international currents in architecture. But later he also had an [important] activity as an architect alongside Nuno Teotónio Pereira, namely in the work on the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Lisbon, and in a house in Vila Viçosa. Then, on April 25, 1974, he was appointed Secretary of State for Housing and Urbanism and launched SAAL – Outpatient Services for Local Support, a completely revolutionary social housing program, in keeping with the spirit of the time. Afterwards, Nuno Portas dedicated himself more to urban planning issues and not so much to architecture. He was linked to the beginning of Expo 98. He ended up being someone who, in the last 20 years of his work, began to have more scientific and sociological concerns, and less artistic ones. It's something he had from the beginning, but later it became the center of his activity.
Did Nuno Portas have any relationship with Macau?
I think that the relationships would not be as intense compared to other architects and contexts, but we know that Nuno Portas was in Macau at the invitation of the Government for a conference, between 2001 and 2002. It is interesting because from this passage we have echoes of what happened, such as his surprise when discovering Manuel Vicente's Ellen Liang orphanage, which he did not know about. It was Manuel Vicente's first work in Macau, in the 60s, and we know that Nuno Portas was moved when visiting this work, especially the small chapel that exists in the orphanage. It's interesting because there was no direct relationship between Manuel Vicente and Nuno Portas, they are figures at very different poles, and even opposites. There is also an interesting and positive reference to the Siza plan [Vieira, Plano de Expansão da Cidade de Macau (Areia Preta e Porto Exterior, 1982), which is being built when Nuno Portas visits Macau. It is interesting that he commented on this plan because in the 60s and 70s the relationship between Nuno Portas and Siza Vieira was no longer the same, and the fact that he made complimentary references to Siza is very interesting.
He was a student of Nuno Portas. What other aspects of your career or personality can you highlight?
I also worked with him. He was a cultured man, very intelligent and with an overwhelming memory. He was someone who liked to provoke, but in a good way, to argue, to contradict. I was lucky enough to maintain a decades-long dialogue with him, and it is this personal knowledge that I will pass on. I also notice that he was a man very close to the power in Lisbon, to the parties, but always very independent. He was a personal friend of Jorge Sampaio, he was Secretary of State, but he never had a major political role. On the one hand, this is due to his independence, but on the other he was such a controversial and intelligently restless figure, that I think power was also scared of him.
This week he also spoke at the conference “Lisbon, Porto, Macau, Maputo: Heroic Collective Housing from the 60s &amp; 70s”. How do you describe Macau’s public housing projects in those years?
There are many architects I could talk about, but I focused on the work of Manuel Vicente in Macau, namely the public housing complex in Fai Chi Kei, which was demolished and later gave rise to the project by Rui Leão and Carlota Bruni. I didn't specifically talk about Portuguese or Macanese architects, we also have names like, for example, José Maneiras. Especially because Portuguese architects have always been few in Portugal, and from the 1950s there were around 150, later increasing greatly in number. But I paid [at the conference] a tribute to the Portuguese architects who built during that period, because in a complex territory and with its vicissitudes, different from those that existed in Portugal, they knew how to carry out extraordinary architectural experiments in the field of public housing. I tried to demonstrate what was happening in Lisbon, Porto, Macau and Lourenço Marques, now Maputo, in different ways. In Macau, relationships were established, which I call heroic, in the sense that they were relationships of experimental architecture, in which people had to adapt, have their own spirit. These are architectures that already have a bit of history, as 50 or 60 years have passed, but the examples we find in these cities continue to be remarkable.
What projects do you highlight from these years?
I spoke about the “Pantera Cor-de-Rosa” housing development, by Gonçalo Byrne, in Chelas, Lisbon. I showed “Cinco Fingers”, by Vítor Figueiredo, also from Lisbon, and “Bairro da Bouça”, by Siza Vieira, in Porto. I showed the Fai Chi Kei complex, by Manuel Vicente, and a project by Pancho Guedes in Mozambique. Despite being distant in time, these are architectures that remain fundamental references from a cultural and architectural point of view. There is a kind of narrative luck in being able to talk about such different places, and with such different architects, and show how they had this heroic, experimental, moving, even radical side that the architecture of that period in particular had.
Has Macau had a positive evolution with regard to the supply of public housing?
I arrived in August and have been visiting the territory in recent years, so I have been following this process a little. Macau is, obviously, an extraordinary territory and due to the coexistence of very different cultures when it comes to housing, which here has a scale and expression completely different from that of Portugal. In Portugal there is an aversion to public housing towers, it has always been something unusual and the results that are known have not been successful for various reasons. But in Macau this is exactly what we see, public housing in towers and with a very strong expression. This has to do with the characteristics of the territory and also with a certain culture in China and Hong Kong. This does not mean that everything being built in Macau is good, there are towers and buildings with less interesting solutions or that result from a certain repetition. But there is no city that only has good architecture or good public housing. The challenge is to solve the housing problem on a large scale, something that must be studied and thought about. It is beautiful and overwhelming to see that Macau is a territory that grows day after day and it is exciting to observe this from an architectural point of view as well. That's what I'm doing, working on future projects.
Analysis projects, or academic ones?
Yes, I'm a professor and researcher at the University of Coimbra and a columnist for the Público newspaper, so my job is to analyze and investigate. I've already published a lot about Macau and I want to go back to some points that I left unresolved, so to speak. I am very encouraged by everything I have seen and the people I have spoken to, and perhaps I will increase my work on the territory from an academic and research point of view.
At a time when Portugal has a chronic housing problem, with a lack of public housing, could Macau be an example?
Not directly, because of the typological issue of the housing tower. It might not be a welcome model in the Portuguese context. But without a doubt, Portugal needs to learn from other experiences and other territories and needs to find solutions. Certainly, what is happening in Hong Kong and Macau are experiences that are very interesting to know, not to replicate, but to understand that this is a global problem [the lack of housing].
Remember Nuno Portas
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) will host today, starting at 6:30 pm, the conference “Nuno Portas: from architecture to urbanism, from man to city”, with Jorge Figueira. It will be time to talk about a journey that the recently deceased architect began in 1959, with a text about the new generation of the Modern Movement in Portugal. Texts followed in the 60s and 70s with “scientific approaches”, with Nuno Portas wandering between architecture and urbanism, always in a reflective way. Nuno Portas was a “multifaceted figure, best known for launching the SAAL social housing program, which is still the subject of research and an example today”, describes Jorge Figueira in a note. The speaker is linked to the Center for Social Studies and the Department of Architecture of the University of Coimbra.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:33:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, academic: “China is reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended her doctoral thesis at the University of Aveiro that analyzes how China has positioned itself, in recent decades, as an important actor in “Global Health Governance”. Today, Beijing is looking for “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “Global South” and is trying to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let’s start with the concept of global health governance (GGS). Is it a more contemporary concept or one related to the post-World War II period and the founding of the World Health Organization (WHO)? Who have been the main actors in this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance has grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and global interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, requiring multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, it has only been since the 1990s that greater awareness has been made of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by Western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors in this governance, until the rise of China, were historically marked by interventions from entities such as the WHO and non-governmental organizations, predominantly North American and European.
One of the conclusions of his doctoral thesis is that China has gradually positioned itself in this leadership. When and why did this positioning begin?
Yes, China has progressively positioned itself as a key player in the evolution of the GGS system. Although it is not possible to pinpoint an exact start date, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a major player in the global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in the historical dynamics of the GGS, as in the 1960s China tried to play a role in humanitarian health assistance in neighboring countries and in Africa. The thesis highlights that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a State chooses its own path instead of a pre-established model, aligning with the prediction of the 21st century as the “Asian Century”.
Did the years of the pandemic influence this position? In what way?
The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of failing to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Road before and after the pandemic, indicating that the years of the pandemic allowed for greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Road as platforms for more effective cooperation between Nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic has intensified China's role in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health sector, which ones do you highlight as the most important?
In the thesis, I address the reforms of China's healthcare system and highlight that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of market-oriented economic reforms and state-led development, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism in political issues in general, with the healthcare sector being no different from the rest. One of China's contributions mentioned, recognized by the WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors”. Furthermore, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which include primary healthcare reforms, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious benchmark for China's domestic health reforms, also covering social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to the WHO, or simply to create an alternative movement that can coexist with the WHO, in the context of its relationship with the Global South? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a “dual approach”: while integrating into existing global structures, it simultaneously forges alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as the BRICS and partnerships with the Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist with and complement the role of the WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to aligning the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, showing its willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the cooperation mechanisms already existing in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's vision of a “Community of Shared Future for Humanity”, which includes the notion of “Global Health Community for All”, also points to a new perspective in the scope of international cooperation.
Masks, vaccines and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM): what products or instruments are used by China to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis highlights that China is an indispensable provider of global public health goods, essential for the supply chain of products, such as masks and vaccines. TCM is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its treatments derived from Chinese herbs, some of which were already recognized by the WHO in 2017. Furthermore, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to the WHO, could China be taking advantage of the lack of full representation in that same WHO, or gaps in its functioning?
The thesis does not directly address whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representation in the WHO or gaps in its functioning. However, she emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge regarding the health governance paradigm from a non-Western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor in the Global South. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized solutions to health challenges, different from those advocated by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union's (EU) foreign policy towards China affected or influenced the country's position in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled “Challenges on the European Union-China cooperation in higher education from ‘people-to-people dialogue’ perspective: The case of health-related joint projects”, explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that which includes projects related to health. It appears, therefore, that, despite strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of EU-China bilateral relations has intensified, with the Commission assuming a decline in enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU sanctions on human rights, economic coercion and trade measures against the single market, and China's position in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader framework of building a strategic partnership between the EU and China. However, it is clear that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between the EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general picture. It is suggested that both the EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without a pandemic, what could China's role be in global health governance?
Although the thesis will be published this year, it focuses on the period leading up to and including the pandemic, where I do not directly speculate on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without a pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant but a moderate reformist force in shaping global health norms. Regardless of future political scenarios, its growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, domestic reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Road will continue to shape its role in global health governance. The vision of a “Global Health Community for All” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in the GGS occur more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance is manifested through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with an increasing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen its role in the Global South and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Road indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist activist, 34 years old, physical engineer, Romani national. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied the right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on staying, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
The gentlemen we are talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP Macau | Entry lists presented did not disappoint</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/16/gp-macau-listas-de-inscritos-apresentadas-nao-desapontaram/</link><description>Last Monday, the Organizing Committee of the Macau Grand Prix presented the 72nd edition of the biggest sporting event in the territory. In total, there will be seven grids of GT, touring cars, single-seaters and motorcycles that will provide, between qualifying races and races, a total of eleven unpredictable battles for victory in the always charismatic and world-respected Guia Circuit
The Macao SAR will have 19 riders in total, spread across four races in the program, as it will not have riders in either the GT race, the Motorcycle Grand Prix or the Guia Race. The territory will be represented by Charles Leong Hon Chio at the Macau Grand Prix – FIA FR World Cup. The champion of this season's PRO class of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia moves on to Formula Regional, a category that has not been raced since 2020, when it was still called F3 (!) in Asia.
Tiago Rodrigues, in his third participation in the event, and Marcus Cheong, in his second, will defend the colors of the Macao SAR in the first edition of the F4 World Cup, a race that will feature seven former F4 champions or equivalent. The rest of the territory's delegation will compete in the GT Cup – Great Bay Race, with seven drivers, and in the Macau Roadsport Challenge, with nine.
We have to go back to the beginning of the 1970s to find such a low presence of Portuguese drivers in a Grand Prix. In addition to young Tiago Rodrigues, veterans of the territory Rui Valente and Jerónimo Badaraco will be present, both in the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. The universe of Lusophony is completed with the Brazilian Ethan Nobels, who will make his debut at the Guia Circuit in the F4 race.
Portugal's last representation in the race dates back to the 2022 Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix, when André Pires and Sheridan Morais overcame mandatory confinement, with Morais achieving a podium, a unique feat for Portuguese motorcycling. In cars, the last participation was in 2019, when Tiago Monteiro drove a Honda Civic Type-R TCR in the Guia Race.
Interestingly, at a time when there is an increase in female participation in motorsport events worldwide, there is not a single lady among the more than one hundred and sixty drivers registered in the Grand Prix.
Mercedes smudges the paint
After two years with pelotons with two dozen GT3 cars, the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup is once again below that benchmark number. Fortunately, the sixteen cars from six different manufacturers, including the returning McLaren, will be driven by drivers with world-class credentials. Well-known names from Macau, such as Edoardo Mortara or Raffaele Marciello, joined by the new hero of Chinese motorsport, the winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Ye Yifei, alleviate any disappointments. If Audi Sport Asia, at a time when the Ingolstadt brand is disinvesting in GT races, had backed down, we would have fewer cars than in the 2018 edition, where only fifteen machines lined up.
The introduction of torque sensors in this year's race – a costly decision made entirely by the FIA ​​– was at the heart of Mercedes-AMG's decision not to participate in the event. The German brand's business model involves registering cars in partnership with teams from the region at the event. In Southeast Asia, cars are constantly on the move via containerized transport, leaving little opportunity for conversion work and sensor testing, which is imperative for Mercedes-AMG. Everyone is certain that the Stuttgart brand will return to the Guia Circuit in the near future, but this year Maro Engel will not be able to defend the crown won last year.
Classics maintain their aura
With Michael Rutter's absence confirmed, there was a lot of apprehension about the entry list for the Motorcycle Grand Prix, but the presence of Davey Todd, last year's winner, and Peter Hickman will keep the race on the international radar. Twelve countries, all European, will be represented on a grid that this year will feature four newcomers, while of the four brands present, BMW and Honda make up more than 70% of the twenty entries.
Notably, no rider competes on a Kawasaki, marking the first time this decade that the company, which next year celebrates 130 years since its founding, has not had a presence in Asia's premier motorcycle road race.
At a time when Tourist racing is experiencing a less vigorous moment worldwide, the Guia Race already has twenty-four cars registered, three of which will still have to be filled by drivers to be nominated. The presence of the stars of the FIA ​​TCR World Tour, which is once again decided on the local circuit, is always synonymous with a good show on the track.</description><pubDate>2025-10-16 02:48:16</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau: First names and first questions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/10/gp-macau-primeiros-nomes-e-primeiras-duvidas/</link><description>October is usually the month of preparations for the Macau Grand Prix. With the championships coming to an end all over the world, attention turns to the Macao SAR's big event, which this year will take place from the 13th to the 16th of November
 
After Marcos Cheong and Vernice Lau raced in the Chinese Formula 4 Championship race, this weekend it is Tiago Rodrigues' turn to pick up the helmet again to compete in the closing race of the Chinese competition season, on the circuit in the neighboring city of Zhuhai. The former Chinese champion of the discipline has been away from single-seater racing since participating in the Middle East Formula 4 Championship at the beginning of the year, but his experience could prove to be an asset in defending the territory's colors at the Guia Circuit.
Twenty of the Mygale M21-F4 single-seaters from the Chinese championship will be overhauled after this race at the Zhuhai International Circuit and handed over to technicians appointed by the French Motor Sport Federation (FFSA), who will put them on the track in the first edition of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup, in Macau. This is the same model used in the French Formula 4 Championship.
Some names of the bikes
Michael Rutter's absence from the entry list for this year's Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix is ​​now a certainty. However, through the specialized press, the first names that will shape the only road race on the Asian continent are beginning to become known.
Practically confirmed are the presence of Davey Todd, winner of last year's edition, and Peter Hickman, the motorcyclist who chases Rutter's record of victories and who should be practically recovered from the injuries suffered in the accident on the Isle of Man. Both will drive the official competitive BMW M1000RR from 8TEN Racing. Rob Hodson, SMT Racing driver, has also guaranteed his presence in the Macao SAR, usually being one of the strong candidates for the Top 5 in the race.
But not only renowned names are tested. Among the debutants already confirmed is ramp driver Maurizio Bottalico. The San Marino driver, who reached the podium at the Manx Grand Prix, follows in the footsteps of other great Italian names in 21st century road racing — such as Stefano Bonetti, Luca Gottardi or Alex Polita — by taking on the most famous and feared race in the East.
According to the Road Racing News portal, there will be more newcomers to the Guia Circuit this year, such as Mitch Rees, a driver with several titles in New Zealand, Ryan Whitehall, a driver from the Isle of Wight, and the new holder of the Frohburger Dreieck lap record in the Supersport category, Paul Jordan.
Questions in the GT
Stéphane Ratel, founder and CEO of SRO Motorsports Group — the company that co-organizes the FIA ​​GT World Cup Macau Grand Prix — has been one of the most critical voices regarding the introduction of torque sensors in GT3 racing. However, the FIA ​​decided in favor of its use in the Guia Circuit World Cup, and the French businessman spoke about the matter for the first time.
"The teams competing in Macau are mostly from Asia, where torque sensors have never been used. The lack of experience could affect the sporting balance, and that's why I opposed their use", said Stéphane Ratel to the German magazine Motorsport Aktuell, adding that he does not believe this is the way forward.
Although the SRO Motorsports Group is co-organizer of the event and has a Balance of Performance (BoP) recognized worldwide, in the last two years the Macau BoP has been determined by the FIA ​​itself. Last year, the FIA's BoP was subject to a series of criticisms, with teams and drivers – particularly from Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, the main losers – publicly expressing their displeasure at the differences in pace. For this reason, the FIA ​​decided to introduce these expensive sensors, installed on the cars' transmission shafts, which represent the most accurate tool for measuring the power transmitted to the wheels.
“Some manufacturers supported the idea, but others, like Mercedes, were against it,” said Stéphane Ratel. "As a result, we lost some cars from the entry list. To be clear: I look at this issue pragmatically, not dogmatically. Last year in Macau, three or four manufacturers could have won without these torque sensors. In 2025 we will see if this technology is really useful", he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-10-10 00:11:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing | Diogo Craveiro with bronze at the figure skating world championships</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/24/pequim-diogo-craveiro-com-bronze-nos-mundiais-de-patinagem-artistica/</link><description>Portuguese skater Diogo Craveiro won this Thursday the bronze medal in the free variant of the World Figure Skating Championship, taking place in Beijing.

The German manufacturer, who won for the first time in Macau in 1956, cited the new torque sensors as the reason for his absence, but there is evidence that other factors also played a part in the decision.
For the first time since the creation of the FIA ​​GT World Cup in 2015, Mercedes-AMG will not be represented in the race. The reason, officially, is the change in the technical regulations, with the imposition of torque sensors, a requirement that Mercedes-AMG and its customer teams claim they have not been able to prepare adequately to compete competitively. At least, the Hong Kong teams, GruppeM Racing and Craft-Bamboo Racing, had intentions of returning to the Macao SAR race this year.
“This decision was taken together with our teams”, explained Stefan Wendl, responsible for Mercedes-AMG Customer Racing, in a statement shared with the press. "The additional technical and budgetary costs associated with the recently introduced torque sensors are, unfortunately, unaffordable for us. Together with the teams that normally compete in Macau, we carefully evaluated all available options. In the end, we came to the conclusion that, given the current conditions, it would not be possible to guarantee a sufficient level of preparation to ensure a competitive overall package."
Neither of the two Hong Kong-based teams has any experience with torque sensors, Mercedes-AMG knew since March that it would have to solve this problem if it wanted to return to the Guia Circuit. However, he did nothing in this regard. On the other hand, the Mercedes-AMG team competing in the FIA ​​World Endurance Championship (WEC) this year, Iron Lynx, faced difficulties when the MagCanica sensors did not integrate correctly with Magneti Marelli's ECU software. But this is not the whole story,
Other “obstacles”
Mercedes-AMG is in a transition phase, moving away from its former long-time partner, HWA, to establish its own internal competition division, called Affalterbach Racing GmbH. However, in this transition phase, the brand continues to use HWA engineers, despite many of this company's staff having already passed to the brand's new official structure, and to support the sale of material to its customers, which is seen by many as a situation uncomfortable.
On the other hand, the Mercedes-AMG GT3 is reaching the end of its life, with the Stuttgart brand developing another car for the category, the details of which remain secret, based on the Concept AMG GT Track Sport, and whose arrival on the market is scheduled for 2027. Although Mercedes-AMG continues to invest energy, money and resources in its projects in the GT3 category in this transition phase, the reality is that the brand's bet It is in the future and not in the present. The high cost of introducing these torque sensors, without guarantees of reliability, would have forced Mercedes-AMG Customer Racing to make major commitments at a time when it has internal obstacles to overcome.
Guaranteed return
This absence of the German brand marks the end of a series of victories for the Mercedes-AMG GT3. On the streets of Macau, the car, which is now in its second evolution, after its launch in 2015, achieved five World Cup victories, out of a possible seven, the most recent being in 2024 with the German Maro Engel. In the pandemic years, from 2020 to 2022, in which the FIA ​​did not hold the World Cup, the three-pointed star brand won all three editions of the Macau GT Cup.
Therefore, it is no surprise that “the FIA ​​GT World Cup continues to be an attractive event for Mercedes-AMG, both from a sporting and strategic point of view, and we look back and see a long and successful history in Macau”, explained Stefan Wendl, taking the opportunity to wish “all participants in Macau an exciting and successful racing weekend”.
Despite the absence of Mercedes-AMG, the entry list for the FIA ​​GT World Cup, which will take place from 13 to 16 November, will feature sixteen cars from six giants of the automotive industry: Audi, BMW, Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren and Porsche.</description><pubDate>2025-10-23 23:51:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorsport | MSAR comics with special debut in Japan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/26/automobilismo-banda-desenhada-da-raem-com-estreia-especial-no-japao/</link><description>The Macau comic strip, “Heróis do Circuito” (街道), had its first international appearance in a very special way two weeks ago, at the 1000 km of Suzuka, in Japan
The classic endurance race had not been contested since 2019, and, to mark the return of this iconic race in the Land of the Rising Sun, Porsche Motorsport Asia Pacific decided to decorate the three cars it supported with the Stuttgart brand's historic colors. Among them, one of Absolute Racing's Porsche 911 GT3 R was painted yellow and black, in honor of Joest Racing's victory in the 1985 24 Hours of Le Mans, when Portuguese Domingos Piedade was Sporting Director of the German team. With the current sponsors, and not with the French clothing brand NewMan, responsible for the decoration 40 years ago, the inscription in Portuguese stood out on the rear wing of the Porsche 911 GT3 R nº 7: “Heróis do Circuito”.
For those who follow local motor sport closely, the comic strip “Heróis do Circuito” is already part of the territory’s motoring culture. Passionate about the ninth art and a self-confessed devotee of motor sports, MP Man is the “Jean Graton of Macau”. His title, often seen on cars at local Grand Prix races, has this time reached an international stage.
Regarding participation in the most prestigious endurance race for GT3 cars on the Asian continent, MP Man told HM: "Upon receiving this exciting news, I felt surprise and admiration. This recognition not only values ​​the effort and dedication of years, but also opens a door for the presence of an original Macau brand on the international motorsport stages, allowing us to show the world the unique cultural character and creativity of Macau, an honor that fills me with pride and enthusiasm.”
The international debut could not have gone better in sporting terms, as Absolute Racing's #7 Porsche 911 GT3 R, driven by Kévin Estre, Laurens Vanthoor and Patrick Pilet, crossed the line in second place overall, in a race that also scored points for the Intercontinental GT Challenge.
Bring together synergies
Interestingly, the springboard for placing the MSAR cartoon on a top car from Absolute Racing, an Asian team supported by Porsche Motorsport Asia Pacific and with several triumphs in the Macau GT Cup, was a common sponsor: a model car brand from southern China.
"We maintain a close and friendly relationship with the renowned national collector model brand Almost Real. The founder, Liu Xueshen, Mr. Sum, has always enthusiastically supported my comic book, and has now become one of the main sponsors.
With an ambitious vision, they intend to take the work across borders, exploring new horizons", explained the author, responsible for some of the illustrations on display at the Macau Grand Prix Museum. "By becoming sponsors of Absolute Racing, they integrated elements of the Heróis do Circuito brand into the racing car's paintwork, allowing the vehicle, when running on the track, to announce to the world the unique charm of the comic strip.”
For MP Man, who launched the first issue of “Heróis do Circuito” in 2018, the objective is clear: “For racing and comic book fans to pay more attention to the original creation made in Macau and recognize the effort dedicated to this project.”
Looking to the future
Presence at the Suzuka event, which brought together more than 65 thousand spectators, constituted a decisive step in the brand's internationalization.
"Now, “Heroes of the Circuit” has reached a moment of great significance. Like an eagle taking flight, he has successfully joined a team supported by Porsche, participating in an endurance race that brings together the best teams and drivers from all over Asia", says MP Man, who does not hide his ambition to go further. "If one day my brand manages to reach races like Le Mans, or even a Formula 1 Grand Prix, it will be a dream come true! (laughs) This is, without a doubt, my deepest desire. But I also know that dreams do not come true immediately; my work still has a lot to evolve and perfect. I will continue to create with humility, persevering in improving the work, seeking to offer readers ever more experiences exciting.”
Meanwhile, the fourth volume of the “Circuit Heroes” series is about to be published, opening a new chapter, always with its unique charm and captivating narratives that have won the attention and affection of the local public, increasingly establishing itself in the global universe of comics and among motor sports fans.</description><pubDate>2025-09-26 07:21:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Vernice Lao, just 15 years old, made her F4 debut in Chengdu</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/19/vernice-lao-de-apenas-15-anos-estreou-se-na-f4-em-chengdu/</link><description>In an initiative supported by the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), Marcus Cheong and Vernice Lao participated in the Chengdu race of the Chinese Formula 4 Championship. The two drivers from local karting competed against some of the best single-seater drivers in the region, and for young Vernice Lao, this was an absolute debut in motorsport.
At the newly built Tianfu Chengdu International Circuit, Marcus Cheong returned to the Formula 4 discipline, having already had several forays into the category, having even finished in 12th place in the 2023 Macau Grand Prix Formula 4 Race.
On this return, the Macau driver drove one of the Mygale chassis, the same as those that will be used in the FIA ​​World Cup at the Guia Circuit, at the end of the year, by the Apollo RFN Racing by Blackjack team. In the sister team Asia Racing Team, founded in Macau in 2003, and also supported by AAMC, 15-year-old Vernice Lao took her first steps in motor racing, after two days of testing in Zhuhai with the single-seater built in France.
Rodolfo Ávila, Team Manager of the team of the two drivers from the territory, highlighted "how fantastic it is to see two drivers supported by the AAMC, something that has a special meaning for me, as I also took my first steps in the single-seater competition with the support of the AAMC. Seeing these young talents from Macau following a similar path is extremely gratifying, and their participation has a very special importance for both me and the team."
Consistent results
After Friday's qualifying sessions, in Saturday's first race Marcus Cheong reached sixth place in the CFGP class and finished 12th overall. Vernice Lao ranked 6th in the Formula 4 class for young drivers, occupying 18th position overall. In the second race of the same day, Marcus Cheong repeated the result, again taking 6th place in the CFGP class and 12th place overall. Vernice Lao finished in 23rd place, also securing 6th position in the Formula 4 class.
In the first race on Sunday, Marcus Cheong improved his performance, reaching 5th place in the CFGP class and 10th place overall. In turn, Vernice Lao finished 7th in Formula 4, corresponding to 19th overall. In the final clash of the weekend, Marcus Cheong shone by taking 2nd place in the CFGP class, also obtaining an honorable 6th place in the general classification. As for Vernice Lao, she finished 13th overall, securing a consistent 6th position in the Formula 4 class.
Very positive balance
On a particularly demanding weekend, with variable track conditions, Portuguese Rodolfo Ávila highlighted the performance of the Macau drivers supported by AAMC, Marcus Cheong and Vernice Lao. "Both showed clear progress throughout the weekend and Vernice, in particular, impressed everyone with a clean and confident debut in single-seaters. Competing against such an experienced field, with so little experience in a Formula 4 car, and delivering the performance she achieved was a pleasant surprise", said the 2003 Asian Formula Renault champion.
On social media, Vernice Lao reported that this was “an incredible experience”, adding that “over the weekend we lost a lot, but we ended up achieving a satisfactory result”. The Macao SAR driver acknowledged that “there is still a long way to go” and took the opportunity to thank “the support and encouragement” from the team, the Team Manager and her teammate, in what she classified as “an unforgettable weekend with the Asia Racing Team”.
The next step for the two drivers from the territory is not yet known, but the Chinese Formula 4 Championship ends in the neighboring city of Zhuhai on the weekend of October 11th and 12th. Afterwards, these same cars from the Chinese competition will be reviewed before traveling to Macau, where they will be used in the FIA ​​World Cup.</description><pubDate>2025-09-19 00:42:07</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
