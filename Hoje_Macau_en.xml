The Lusitano Club of Hong Kong, with about 400 members, has been available Portuguese courses for about five years, but the initiative “is not official”, the president said to Lusa, the institution, Patrick Rozario, who now wants to bring more quality to the institution's offer.
In this sense, Club Lusitano and Ipor signed, on Thursday, in Macao, an agreement that, among other purposes, wants to reinforce collaboration in teaching and learning Portuguese. “In the future, the Portuguese classes we offer in the Club will be under the guidance and approval of IPOR. We will continue to do what we have done, but IPOR will help us with the material and program,” said the president of the largest institution in the Hong Kong Lusodescendant community, founded in 1866.
Rozario also expects in the future to make the courses available for non-member. For now, specifies, “members and friends” - including 'Visas Gold' - have resorted to the linguistic program. "It seems that we have more and more people interested in attending Portuguese classes," said the Lusodescendent, noting that, in the last "four, five years", they passed there between 30 and 40 students.

About this partnership will work, the director of IPOR explained to Lusa that the courses will be organized by IPOR - including teaching programs and methodology - and trainers guided by the institution. "When issuing a certificate of the learning of these courses, which are made at Club Lusitano, the seal of IPOR has been departed, and the seal of IPOR offers the quality," he said.
Still with regard to the protocol signed on Thursday, Patrícia Ribeiro spoke of the intention of “strengthening collaboration in the cultural area and holding events” in Hong Kong. "We are invited to participate in fairs or festivals (…) like the consulate [of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong] does not have a office [in Hong Kong], but only one person -and it is not every day -the Lusitano club will be a support to develop these activities and promote Portuguese language and culture," he noticed.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 02:21:49</pubDate></item><item><title>DSAMA | GUARANTEED QUALITY OF WATER SUPPLY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/dsama-garantida-qualidade-do-fornecimento-de-agua/</link><description>The Directorate of Maritime and Water Affairs Services (DSAMA) ensures that "the quality of water provided in Macao fulfills the standards." The position was taken in response to the Macau Daily Times newspaper, as a result of doubts about the water quality of the Jiangmen public network.
In recent days there have been several complaints inside due to the fact that the water of the tap supplied in Jiangmen comes with a yellow or brownish color. The issue was explained by local authorities with the adoption of new procedures in water disinfection and treatment. The explanations did not prevent several images from circulating online and in the official media.
In Macao, indicates the Macau Daily Times, 90 percent of water comes from the Xijiang Modaomen waterway, located in Zhuhai. However, strange waterway extends to a section of Rio Ri, which passes through Jiangmen.
Regarding these aspects, DSAMA has ensured that together with the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) controls the quality of the supplied water and that there is a joint safety mechanism with the interior, for emergency cases on water quality. This warning mechanism, the authorities explained, works by classification of emergencies to varying degrees, which require different answers.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:49:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Wechat | Burlão misses woman in a group of parents</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/wechat-burlao-desfalca-mulher-em-grupo-de-pais/</link><description>Last Thursday, the Judiciary Police received a report of burla in a Wechat group that a Macao school created to maintain parents and guardians in contact with the teachers.

Following this case, the Macao Education Association asked people to generate the conversation groups between parents and teachers to report abnormal situations to maintain order and protect the rights of parents and students.
The Association's vice president, Vong Kuoc Ieng, pointed out to the newspaper or Mun that wechat groups between schools and parents are increasingly common, especially to make important notifications of class activity.

On the first day, the main exhibition of the Biennial will be inaugurated at the Macau Museum of Art (MAM), and includes works by 46 artists from 13 countries and regions, presenting to the public about 80 works or sets.
In this show, which is evident until October 19 this year, the public is "invited to reflect on the history and" local "memory of Macau", as well as the "complexities of the global situation and to explore the nature of life in depth." Artists such as Xu Bing, Bart Hess, Zhang Peili, Chan Hung-Lu and Kimsooja participate.
Also on Saturday, at 3 pm, a moderate lecture by the Biennial curator Feng Boyi, who will be dialoguing with co-stupid Liu Gang and Wu Wei, along with artists Song Dong and Xue Feng. According to a note from the Cultural Institute (IC), these personalities will take advantage of the Macau Biennial as a “study case”, analyzing in the session “The themes of exposure, concepts, the details of implementation, the resulting discrepancies and the results, exploring the current state, the questions and dilemmas that curatorship currently faces, as well as thought, strategies and solutions involved”. Highlight for the fact that this lecture will take place in Mandarin and have only English translation.
Alien
Still on Saturday, two sessions of a workshop starred by artist Chan Hung-Lu. This event has as its theme “exploration of inner aliens”, using the exposed works and guidance of participants so that they can “mentally visualize other aliens through the mobile phone and reflect on origins and differences through meditation practices and image generation technology by artificial intelligence”. This workshop will be taught in Mandarin.
The Macau Biennial is divided into six sections, namely the main exhibition, the public art exhibition, the city's pavilion, the special exhibition, the local curatorship project and the collateral exhibition, with about 30 exhibitions held between July and October this year.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 02:14:10</pubDate></item><item><title>UNESCO | Government guarantees that it will respond to concerns</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/unesco-governo-garante-que-vai-responder-a-preocupacoes/</link><description>Macao will “follow up to the relevant resolutions” of UNESCO. In question is the requirement for environmental impact assessment for the construction of the viaduct between zones A and B of new landfills and information on the eastern east line. Experts point out that UNESCO recognition has boosted cultural tourism in the territory
 
Tomorrow, the 20th anniversary of the Entry of the Historic Center of Macau is celebrated on the World Heritage List of the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO). It runs until next Thursday, in Paris, the 47th Convention of the World Heritage Committee, where the mashes is represented by the Cultural Institute.
At the end of last week, during the UNESCO Convention, the Committee issued a monitoring resolution to the State of Macao's Heritage Conservation. In addition to some compliments, the international institution calls for the comprehensive environmental impact assessment regarding the construction of the viaduct that will connect zones A and B of new landfills, especially a part that may violate the height restrictions around the guide headlight.
The issue of buildings for ending the sidewalk of the guide and the construction of the Light Metro Line line were also topics on which the World Heritage Committee requested additional information, pointing out as a delivery time of all documentation on December 1, 2026, the Tribuna de Macao newspaper (JTM) reported.
In a statement issued on Friday night, the Cultural Institute indicates that “it will follow relevant resolutions and submit to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee the documents related to the monitoring of relevant projects for analysis, according to the general communication mechanism in the past”.
Documentation will be delivered through the state administration of China's cultural heritage.
Unnatural
The JTM also indicated that the UNESCO Committee enhances the commitments and efforts made in the Historic Center's safeguard and management plan, with a view to implementing previous requests from the international organization. However, it regrets that it was not heard, as requested, before it came into force in early June last year.
In the statement on Friday, the IC does not mention the repair of the UNESCO Committee, but that it congratulates the MSAR authorities for the formal entry into force and the implementation of the safeguard and management plan and the work of conservation, monitoring, interpretation and exposure of Macao heritage.
History and Game
Experts consider that the classification of the historic center of Macau by UNESCO has boosted cultural tourism in the territory, supporting the diversification of an economy traditionally dependent on casinos, but warns of challenges in promoting heritage.
Na Tcha's temple and the ruins of Sao Paulo are side by side in the historic center of Macau. Early in the morning, families pose to the chamber at the bottom of the iconic stone staircase of the ruins.
“I like the sidewalk [Portuguese], it's special,” says Lusa Alina Wang, a Shanghai tourist. The eight -year -old son York Xiong adds: "The buildings are beautiful." Not everyone in the family, however, knows the story behind Macao's "former libris", reduced to the facade after fires. The patriarch, I read Zijian, was going to swear that it had been destroyed during World War II. Beside, another family, this from Xi'an, associates the image of the ruins with a Japanese bombardment in the Great War.
20 years ago, on July 15, 2005, the Historic Center of Macau, a set of 22 monuments that combines Portuguese and Chinese architecture, joined the UNESCO World Heritage list.
This milestone for the city's heritage, Lusa tells the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD), brought more tourists to Macau, changing the profile of the visitor, who stopped crossing the border just to play.
"This changed the image of Macao from a" city of the game "to a cultural destination, differentiating it in the Asia-Pacific region," said the STD.
A study to STD visitors this year reveals that 53.3 percent of tourists arrive in the territory to visit the heritage, surpassing those who want to shop (33.7 percent) and those most interested in gastronomy (18.5 percent).
For IP FEI Law, historian and former member of the Macao Cultural Heritage Council, the UNESCO Statute raised Macao's global profile. "The game has boosted the economy in the short term, culture should boost long -term growth," he told Lusa.
Amusement park
But if, on the one hand, the inscription of heritage came to help diversify the tourist's profile, you have to think of those who live in the city daily, noticed Ka Nok Lo, vice president of the Macao Heritage Ambassadors Association.
In an interview with Lusa, the official warned of the need not to turn Macau “into a Disneyland”, defending the balance between tourism and the needs of residents. "Museums should serve the community, as are libraries, bookstores, not just tourists," he said.
Ka stressed, on the other hand, that the visitors still remain the narrative that unites the various places distinguished by UNESCO. "There is no story that turns on these monuments," he said.
The Macao government has as one of the main objectives to seek economic diversification, in order to reduce its dependence on the game industry through the development of new sectors.
But the appeal of the casinos is unavoidable, such as the families of Shanghai and Xi'an have highlighted. The day after the Macao Historic Zone tour, the visit to the region would continue in the modern resorts of the game concentrated in the Cotai, highlighting the double role of Macao as a gaming destination and cultural heritage.

The banker is being investigated for relations with the Windsor Arch real estate project
 
Former President of the Macao Representation of the China Industrial and Commercial Bank (ICBC), Jiang Yisheng, is being investigated by the interior authorities, being in uncertain whereabouts due to facts practiced in Macao and calls with businessman NG Lap Seng. The news was advanced on Friday by the Caixin Global newspaper, a publication of the interior.
Hours after the information, which initially indicated that Jiang was incontabinently and missing, the Central Disciplinary Inspection Commission confirmed that Jiang Yisheng is being investigated for “severe violation of discipline and law,” a term normally used in corruption -related investigations. In addition to the Central Committee on Disciplinary Inspection, the investigation also involves the Zhuhai Municipal Supervision Committee.
According to Global Caixi, the investigation aimed at Jiang Yisheng deals with real estate loans approved by the Macao ICBC, especially the luxury project Windsor Arch, built ahead of the Jockey Club and in which several local entrepreneurs participated.
This was a project developed by NG Lag Seng, then president of the group Sun Kian IP, and was also part of the investigation within the judicial case that resulted in the judgment of former public works directors, Jaime Carion and Li Canfeng. Also Ng Kei Nin, son of NG Lap Seng, one of the company's directors, was implied in the case. Both were convicted in Macao to comply with prison sentences.
Growing
Global caxin indicates that the investigation comes at a time when ICBC Macao has an increase in evil credit, ie the loans that have been approved to debtors who later cannot pay debts.
The Macao ICBC will also have filed shares against the goods of NG Lap Seng and NG Kei Nin due to money borrowed to the not returned business group. Among the assets that are the target of seizure are about 80 parks of parking, 40 offices and bank deposits and actions on the stock exchange evaluated by more than 1.7 million patacas.
Jiang Yisheng, who was president of the Macao ICBC between 2018 and 2023, was also aimed at a bank's internal disciplinary proceedings, which began in early 2024 due to loan approval without the necessary guarantees.
In 2019, during the presidency of Jiang Yisheng the Macau ICBC was distinguished by Fernando Chui Sai On with the medal of industrial and commercial merit. Jiang Yisheng received the distinction of the then chief executive.
Alongside Banco da China, China's construction bank and China's Agricultural Bank, China's Industrial and Commercial Bank is part of the group of four major interior banks, considered as the main ones in the country. In addition, ICBC is a state bank.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:51:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Water | Ordient Tight supervision after recent scandals</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/agua-pedida-supervisao-apertada-apos-escandalos-recentes/</link><description>The four locally bottled touched water episodes that failed quality and security tests led the deputy to ask for greater control of the products in Macau and to ask for new ways to test the waters
 
Deputy Song Pek Kei appeals to the authorities to reinforce the water quality control measures in the territory. This is how the Legislator linked to the Fujian community reacted to recent locally bottled waters who do not comply with quality or safety standards.
At the interpetement, the deputy wrote to expect authorities to contribute to ensure the quality of bottled water in Macao and correct existing inspection failures.
And one of the problems identified by the deputy involves the way water quality control is done: “Although the institute for municipal issues regularly make random inspections, most of these inspections are made through analyzes to water samples, so the safety of the production line and water -recycled carboys is not controlled,” wrote Song.
Since early May, authorities have revealed at least four cases where different brands of bottled and distributed water in Macao did not meet standards and quality. The targeted brands are the Iceblue water, from the Oi Kou Pou Factory, brand Ieong Iat Tat, from the factory of the same name, the water Sun, from Miram Group, and NK water from the NK drinking water factory.
Under these cases, which were detected by AMI, Song Pek Kei acknowledged that measures were taken to deal with the different situations. However, it criticized the lack of a broader quality and safety control mechanism.
Repeated cases
The deputy linked to the Fujian community was concerned about having been identified "so many cases" in a short time, which contributes to a "social concern" in the face of the supplied water.
Song Pek Kei writes that another of the population's concerns aims at the water available in public spaces, in which the carboys often do not identify the water supplier, do not present the results of the latest water quality tests, nor the recommended date of water consumption.
In addition, Song wants the government to make available in public spaces the date of the last cleaning of the machines that provide water from the carboys.
For this reason, the legislator expects the government to ask the water suppliers to fix labels with information in the water carboys. In addition, the deputy asks the machines to be clean and kept regularly, especially in public spaces and services, such as schools, hospitals and homes for the elderly.
One of the waters aimed at quality problems has seen the M-Mark certification, a seal of quality administration, has been suspended. On this aspect, Song Pek Kei considered that this type of certification must always be dependent on quality tests so that products in Macau can develop a stronger reputation.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:45:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Finance | Public accounts with loss before the reinforcement of social support</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/financas-contas-publicas-com-prejuizo-antes-do-reforco-de-apoios-sociais/</link><description>Public accounts presented in June losses of 289.4 million patacas, a record contrary to the trend since the beginning of the year. Between January and June, the MSAR has an surplus of 11.4 billion of patacas
 
Public accounts show a loss of 289.4 million patacas in June, even before a budget revision to reinforce social support. However, when the period between January and July is considered, data from the Directorate of Finance Services (DSF) show a surplus in public accounts of 11.4 billion. This value represents a 2.5 percent drop compared to the end of May, when Macau had a surplus of 11.7 billion patacas.
Still, the surplus of the city between January and June was 40.3 percent higher than in the same period last year and is already higher than the government forecast for the year 2025: 6.83 billion Patacas.
Macao closed 2024 with an surplus of 15.8 billion patacas, more than twice the one recorded the previous year.
Macao's public expense fell 8.2 percent in the first half of the year, compared to the same period of 2024, to 41.4 billion patacas. The only reason for the fall was spending on social support and subsidies, which decreased 17.7 percent to 20.7 billion patacas.
But the Legislative Assembly approved on Wednesday a government proposal to increase by 2.86 billion the expenses provided for in the budget to reinforce social support. The review includes the creation of a subsidy, totaling 54,000 patacas, for children up to 3 years, to raise the lowest birth in the world.
Smaller recipes
Macao current revenue also fell 0.95 percent in the first half of the year to 52.3 billion patacas. The main reason for the decrease was a drop of 62.3 percent to 520 million patacas, in the “property income”, a heading that includes the revenue of land concessions.
On the contrary, the revenues of taxes on the game - which represent 86.4 percent of the total - rose 1 percent to 45.3 billion patacas.
The six city game operators pay a 35 percent direct tax on the game's revenues, 2.4 percent for the Social Security Fund and urban and tourist development, and 1.6 percent delivered to the Macao Foundation for cultural, educational, scientific, academics and philanthropic purposes.
The total revenues of Macao casinos reached 118.8 billion patacas in the first half of the year, 4.4 percent than in the same period of 2024. On April 15, Sam Hou Fai admitted to fear a budget deficit in 2025, due to the slowdown in game revenues.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:42:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Sao Tome and Prince | Relationship with China is discreet, but strategic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/sao-tome-e-principe-relacao-com-china-e-discreta-mas-estrategica/</link><description>On Saturday, 50 years of the independence of Sao Tome and Principe were celebrated. The future advances to the rhythm of diplomatic relations with other Portuguese speaking countries. For academic Cátia Miriam Costa, the African country and China are strategic partners, despite the description of the relationship between both
 
Researcher Cátia Miriam Costa considers that the relationship between Sao Tome and Principe and China remains discreet, despite being almost celebrating a decade, with growing Beijing's strategic interest in the position of the archipelago in the South Atlantic.
"Since neither country nor another talks much about the subject, we end up not realizing the depth of the relationship well. But I believe it is not yet a very deep relationship," the researcher at the Center for International Studies of ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon, noted to the Lusa.
The geostrategic position of the archipelago, located in the Gulf of Guinea,, however, feeds Beijing's interest, namely in the context of the Chinese bet on the expansion of logistics and sea corridors in the South Atlantic.
"Sao Tome, if it is not a very important port in logistical terms, is a relevant port for control, for example, of piracy, threats. Therefore, this position also certainly reflected by Beijing," he explained.
The restoration of formal ties in 2016, after two decades of Taiwan's recognition by Sao Tome, was a “pragmatic” decision of the African country, and a trump card for Beijing Diplomacy, which always maintained “open channels”, even during the period of removal, Cátia Miriam Costa explained.
"The relationship with China is more fruitful because it brings other counterparts," explained the researcher. "It was also for these counterparts that [in 1997] Sao Tome exchanged the Popular Republic of China for Taiwan, because at that time the Popular Republic of China was a developing country. So it didn't have to offer what Taiwan had, which was perfectly integrated into the international market," he said.
A VOLTE-FACE
In December 2016, Sao Tome officially announced the establishment of relations with the Popular Republic of China, ending the recognition of Taiwan.
The decision caused the immediate cancellation of the scholarships offered by Taiwan to St.-Tome students, many of whom were eventually integrated into the other Chinese universities. China has quickly become one of the main cooperation partners in São Tomé, with promises of investment and support in areas such as education, technical training, agriculture and infrastructure.
The researcher recalled that even before formal relations, Beijing never completely broke with Sao Tome, keeping the country involved in the activities of the Macao Forum, albeit only as an observer, a strategy he considers "typical of Chinese diplomacy." "China does not fully close the doors. It can suspend relationships, but if it is something of national interest, it is usually renegotiated again," he said.
“Limited Results”
Nevertheless, Cátia Miriam Costa acknowledged that the concrete results of cooperation are still limited. “There are more projects in the role than properly ongoing works,” he said, attributing part of the responsibility to the weak institutional capacity of São Tomé, which only recently began to create structures to attract and negotiate foreign investment.
Among the sectors with potential for the deepening of cooperation, the researcher highlighted the fishing, marine resources and eventually cocoa. Oil exploration raises “high risks”, both for technical complexity and environmental limitations.
"China is interested in the region, but it is not because Sao Tome is an attractive market -because it is not -, yes, for its location, stability and integration capacity in a broader regional project," he said.
The researcher also stressed Chinese investment in Chinese language teaching in Sao Tome, which also aims to "create a network of people with language dominance, familiar with culture and potentially useful for the future of bilateral relations." "China maintains a strategic interest in the relationship, even if it does not express it with great visibility. And for a country like Sao Tome, any small help can have a significant impact," he concluded.
Reports of four Sao Tomers who followed courses in China
Denise, Lucineidy, Reginaldo, and Aithysa grew up under the sign of an alliance with Taiwan, until life and academic path were redefined by the rupture of diplomatic ties between Sao Tome and Taipei in 2016.
Denise Aragão Fortes still remembers her hand to Tsai Ing-Wen. It was November 2016, the day of Africa in Taiwan was celebrated, and the official was attended at the time.
It is very likely that behind the scenes would already outline the end of diplomacy between Taiwan and Sao Tome and Principe, but for this student of International Relations at the University of Ming Chuan, Taoyuan, North Taiwanese, the news, who arrived a month after these celebrations, on December 21, was a surprise.
“There was no rumors, nothing,” recalls Lusa Denise, now 29, working in marketing and living in Almada, Portugal.
When the secondary finished, also the bonds between the island and the African nation, agreed in 1997, had just reached the age of adult. There was “very closeness” between the parts, with Taiwanese friendships in the family.
Normality shaken this December 2016. Studying with a scholarship granted by Taipé, Denise and other St.-Tome students in Taiwan was given the option of continuing studies without financial assistance, or being transferred to China as scholarships. Being at the end of the academic course, Denise remained in Taoyuan. Most, however, changed geography, university and life.
Country “full of opportunities”
Lucineidy Almeida, now 28, saw the arrival in Tianjin, northern China, as "a new restart" in a "country full of opportunities." Attending the second year of biotechnology in Taichung, this native of Santo António had some difficulty in following the degree in Mandarin. A limitation that would eventually surpass, evaluates today, but in China, had the possibility of studying in English pharmaceutical sciences.
He says he learned of the diplomatic break through social networks and, like all students who spoke to Lusa, left criticism of conducting the process, with “many uncertainties”, information given “on time”, “a feeling of disrespect”, and, in the middle, the suspension of the bags.
Two months after the announcement, he landed in Hong Kong, where he treated his visa, although he still unaware of what his final destination. Only upon arrival in Beijing was he told that he went to Tianjin, recalls Lucineidy, living today in Portugal, in Cacém, and working as an English and Portuguese interpreter in the medical field.
Regarding the diplomatic interruption, it notes that "from what was realized at the time", it was "a monetary question": "in the sense that China offered more [to Sao Tomé] than Taiwan at the time could provide."
The São Tome Prime Minister of the time, Patrice Trovoada, considered the unilateral break of relations as “the right”, taking into account the authorities' view of the country's development. "We decided the principle of joining one China and when adhering implies the cut of relations with Taiwan. The international scenario 20 years ago, not the same as today," he added.
But the new political order did not take students to advance in the academic career. Aithysa Ramos, 32, is still in Beijing, where, after leaving Taiwan, she concluded the master's degree in business management.
If this morning of 2016, the story had not taken this course, would probably have been in Taiwan, where he had lived seven years ago. At the time, it now remembers the English education teacher, was “devastated and angry”: “It was like my second home, I passed [part of] my adolescence, growth phases”.
Reginaldo was in the second year of Business Management at the University of Yuan Ze, Taoyuan, when he stayed to the news. He realized that he “had no power” to change the course of history.
The initial shock, assumes today, was really the cold. Despite admitting "it was" always a process of doubt, "China, where he moved two months after the cutting cut," it was a surprise for the better. " “Because I was still here, not coming back, I can say yes, it was the best thing that happened,” he says.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:35:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Ipor helps Club Lusitano raise quality of teaching Portuguese</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/ipor-ajuda-club-lusitano-a-elevar-qualidade-do-ensino-do-portugues/</link><description>The Portuguese Language Courses offered by the Lusitanian Club of Hong Kong will be guided by the Portuguese Institute of the East (IPOR), thanks to an agreement signed in Macao, both institutions told Lusa.

The Lusitano Club of Hong Kong, with about 400 members, has been available Portuguese courses for about five years, but the initiative “is not official”, the president said to Lusa, the institution, Patrick Rozario, who now wants to bring more quality to the institution's offer.
In this sense, Club Lusitano and Ipor signed, on Thursday, in Macao, an agreement that, among other purposes, wants to reinforce collaboration in teaching and learning Portuguese. “In the future, the Portuguese classes we offer in the Club will be under the guidance and approval of IPOR. We will continue to do what we have done, but IPOR will help us with the material and program,” said the president of the largest institution in the Hong Kong Lusodescendant community, founded in 1866.
Rozario also expects in the future to make the courses available for non-member. For now, specifies, “members and friends” - including 'Visas Gold' - have resorted to the linguistic program. "It seems that we have more and more people interested in attending Portuguese classes," said the Lusodescendent, noting that, in the last "four, five years", they passed there between 30 and 40 students.

About this partnership will work, the director of IPOR explained to Lusa that the courses will be organized by IPOR - including teaching programs and methodology - and trainers guided by the institution. "When issuing a certificate of the learning of these courses, which are made at Club Lusitano, the seal of IPOR has been departed, and the seal of IPOR offers the quality," he said.
Still with regard to the protocol signed on Thursday, Patrícia Ribeiro spoke of the intention of “strengthening collaboration in the cultural area and holding events” in Hong Kong. "We are invited to participate in fairs or festivals (…) like the consulate [of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong] does not have a office [in Hong Kong], but only one person -and it is not every day -the Lusitano club will be a support to develop these activities and promote Portuguese language and culture," he noticed.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Wang Qia, the painter of the Tang Dynasty (618-906), would be remembered as creator of a 'school' of designated painting, 'scattered ink' that valued the spontaneous gesture of brush to make visible something that is naturally invisible. A mode of representation that sought communication between the author's spirit and that of the invited observer to discern the purpose of creation through the exposure of the process.
A demanding discipline, recognized until centuries later by distinguished theoreticals such as Dong Qichang (1555-1635), which put the barrier from which this painting could be exercised very high: no less than in Wang Wei (701-61) mode, the recognized founder of literate painting: 'Only after someone is like Wang Wei can use the Wang Qia Pomo way'.
Examples from the brush of this creator are today hardly observable and the termination of it preserved, there is almost only the seductive echo of a name that refers the listener to the expression of the substance of the Spirit. However, there is another name that in the stories of painting is often associated with him, that of Gu Kuang (727-821), of whom the paintings today are also rare but from whom they have been stored poems that indicate an imponderable presence.
In a palace poem, it is noted the availability to feel the abundant but subtle torrent of beauty captured by the senses, like the one in the wind or in a sound: «In a tower of jade, halfway to the sky, a song blown to the flute begins,/ The wind delivers in the palace the harmonious sound of the Palreo and the laughter of the girls who dwell. Drinking in the clepsidra,/ the waters, redrillants as crystals, would say a curtain unfolded over the Rio do Autumn. » But the poet and painter, disillusioned with the intrigues that embarrassed his duties at the service of the palace, removes the public service and will use the name well daoist buweng, the "old reclusive".
Gu Kuang had obtained the Jinshi degree, which allowed him to be an imperial employee in 757, in the unstable time of Emperor Tang Suzong, whose reign (756-62) would be marked by the concern to calm the revolt of An Lushan who had spread like a forest fire. Revolt that had forced his father to abdicate, Emperor Xuanzong and the consequent condemnation of the death of his favorite concubine, a fact reported in Ba Juyi's plangent poem (722-846), corner of perpetual remorse.
Born in Yunyang (current Danyang, Jiangsu) after a life saddened by the death of a son, he moves with his family in 792 to the mountainous chain of Maoshan, south of Jurong, where he will receive the grace of a new son at the age of seventy. When he goes there, he writes a purpose: «Hidden in Maoshan; To make basic gold metals,/ to make the body light as a pity.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves - Assistant researcher and coordinator of the Educational Service of the Macao Scientific and Culture Center
They have been running ink rivers on the founding of Macao, as well as the foundation of Lisbon. The latter the academics consider it more prudent, after properly analyzed the etymologies, to be due to Phoenicians or Tartassi (Rocha, 2007), but that the legend is poetically reminiscent of Ulysses, from Luís Vaz Camões to Fernando Pessoa.  Thus it reads at the beginning of the eighth corner of Os Lusíadas, which the beginnings of Portugal find their mythical roots in Luso, son and companion of Bacchus, and those of Lisbon in Ulysses (Camões, 1997, VIII.5):
Ulisses is the one who makes the Santa Casa
To the goddess who gives her Facunda language;
That if there in Asia Trojan insigne abrasa,
Here in Europe Lisbon Imparty Funda.
Nothing more about the illustrious Lusitanians descended from gods, as well as their geographical spaces were founded by Greek heroes of unparalleled value such as Ulysses, whose ingenuity warrior and marear art exceeded. Hence, some centuries became Fernando Pessoa, in the second epic poem that the Portuguese value most, the message refer to Ulysses pointing to their mythological dimension and the unavoidable reality that it sustains, since “myth is nothing that is everything” (Pessoa, 1986, 24):
 Thus the legend
To come into reality
And fertilizing it takes place.
Below, life, half
Nothing, dies.
Myths and legends offer reality often the best it has, in its quality of projection reveal ideas and ideals, providing an important source where the unconscious manifests itself, but also the collective conscious of a people. Ulysses Warrior and Navigator is the patriarch found to the measure to found the capital of a country of indomitable warriors who faced powerful empires, such as Muslim, the Roman, and later the Spanish and who had to discover the sea path to India, beyond the Extrema Asia, without ever losing its Cavalheresque facet.
This would be masterfully praised in the corner VI of Os Lusíadas in the episode of the twelve of England, among which figured Magriço. They would know how to defend the honor of their ladies to the sword, revealing a huge bravery, narrated by Veloso (Camões, 1997, VI. 48):
This one, who helps him I didn't want to
 For not causing intestinal discord,
 Tells you: when the law intended
 From the kingdom there from the Iberian lands,
 In Lusitanians I saw so much boldness,
 Both prime and such divine parts,
 That they alone could, if not error,
 Support your part to fire and iron.
This chivalry had to be a constant in the Portuguese imagination, not just with ladies, but with all those who saw each other in trouble. This happened in England, so it would succeed in southern China, when the Portuguese helped the Chinese to clean the pirate seas and in reward were allowed a quiet existence in Macao.
In fact, even if only a myth or a legend, it would only have its reason for being, because it reveals a certain collective image that the Portuguese have of themselves and that greatly contributes, in terms of existential value, to guide the conduct of the population: they are where they are accurate, in helping the most unprotected, in one hand the heart, the heart. This is an image that once mitigated, it may be that "nothing that is everything."
Regarding the founding of Macao, the scholar, faces an interesting mix between myth and reality: first comes reality, then the legend comes, and the latter will have infinitely more weight, but be aware of the following information of unsuspected thinkers and historians.
Luís Gonzaga Gomes, in Macau - A Municipality with History (1997) in the chapter “Divergent Theses on the Origin of Macao”, argues that there are several theses on the foundation of Macao as a Chinese space governed by Portuguese from 1557, and this date does not exclude that the Portuguese had already walked through those stops since 1555, the height of Fernão Mendes Pinto, where the name of the name of the first time appears. Macao related to the Portuguese.
As for theses there are three most credible:
“1) Macao was donated to the Portuguese; 2) This donation was made in rewarding the services provided by Portuguese in the destruction of pirates; and 3) the occurrence took place in 1577” (GOMES, 1997, 26) later, after presenting several points of view, linked to remarkable liters, including Álvaro Semedo, as Chinese, argues that “Macau outside the Portuguese reason Exposed, what is to reward the valuable feat of the destruction of piracy in the seas of southern China ”(GOMES, 1997, 37). In this sense, it is mentioned by several authors, and as a misrepresented as expectable, the name of the fearsome chief of the pirates, which will have valid the famous imperial edict or plate, is called Tchang Si Lao, or Sam Chislao, or Charempum, Litauquiem, or Similao (Gomes, 1997, 37).
This finding does not exclude other more commercial readings from obtaining this platform, which was also commercial in China, and a price for the payment of the ground forum in Da Ming Shi (大明史 History of the Ming Dynasty) quoted by A.J. H. Chargignon, of 20,000 rights in Macau. (GOMES, 1997, 34).
The coexistence of both chronology versions of the history of Macao will be found. XVI-XVII centuries organized by historian Beatriz Basto da Silva (1992), who reassembles an important episode of annihilation of a certain and dangerous pirate Lam Chin at 1547, in a description of Chinese employee Lam Hei-Yuen, who shot the following way “and so the pirates who had acted comfortable for 20 years were won in one day. contrary they protect us against them, they did not do any harm to our people, but they even did the Chinese well ”(Yuen apud Silva, 1992, 33), being presented in the same chronology the year 1554 as the first verbal agreement by Leonel Sousa, which legalizes the situation of payment of commercial rights and“ Portuguese are allowed to be freely trade in the area that would become Macao ”. (SILVA, 1992, 39), dating from 1557 in this chronology the establishment of the first Portuguese in Macao, a date that agrees with the advanced by Luís Gonzaga Gomes, as well as in the suicide of the Chan-Si-Lau pirate and the defeat of the pirates of Rio das Pearls, as well as Leonel Sousa “obtain authorization to establish the previous settlement of the Portuguese in Macau (…) from Macau. ” (SILVA, 1992, 43).
In fact, there is the coexistence of the two most likely origins for the founding of Macau in the chronology of Beatriz Basto da Silva. It was asked: It would have been the verbal agreement and the subsequent settlement, with the payment of the floor of the ground, possible if the effective help of the Portuguese gentlemen and warriors had not been verified to the Chinese authorities, through concrete help to local traders who were constantly pressured by coans who then abounded in the seas of China and southern China?
The cleaning of maritime ground, provided by developed technology, at the best in the world, greatly contributed to helping if it had made it concrete and real, slowly deserving of a western people of the far east of Asia and only because it was really useful in combating pirates could make a legend, since from the beginning either readings was valid but partial. In order to obtain a correct and impartial reading of what has happened, it is believed that it is necessary to combine them, understanding how decisive it was in the good relationship of the two peoples to combat pirates, without them, there would not have been Macao, flushed by foreigners in Chinese territory.

After buying the map, we realize the green spots that this city is filled with gardens. From Tricycle we arrived at a two -star hotel, despite the offering of the four -star accommodation, with discounts, just for some more exchanges allow us to enjoy superior quality of comfort. With the bags already in the room, it is at the reception that we learn about the existence in the city of a brush museum.
Considered the capital of brushes, because according to a saying, the huzhou brushes, the role of Xuan de Xuanzhou rice (Anhui), the paint from China de Huizhou (also in Anhui) and the Duan Stone for the Zhaoqing (Guangdong) paint, are the four treasures of Chinese painting.
Right on the trip to the hotel I could see it is the small town because, from the bus terminal, in ten minutes we are in the center, traveling half the main avenue that longitudinally divides it. Now walking, we will have a channel with terrace on the banks. It looks like a good place to in the shadow, quietly refreshing from the noon. We are in the Hebin Garden. Still sitting and then wave us with a glass and a bottle. After an affirmative gesture, they bring a glass full of green tea leaves and hot water in a thermal container, which on the table is to serve.
Soon appearances appear that for a Reminbi they remove the dust in their shoes, giving them a small polydela. Glasses quickly tormented rest and an EHRU player experiences, with amplifier sounds, captivating us to enjoy a few songs. But his little introduction to the song of “Yue Liang Wo Di Chin” (the moon represents my heart) proves to be more annoying than cultural.
Studying a busy but narrow pedestrian street where, despite the surrounding buildings, they are unmistakable from the environment, a recent dragon door gives access to the part of the city where a long time is perpetuated. Another longmen, this old and made of wood, gives the smoke temple, which will be from the same period and where the floor is arranged. Abroad, a number of antique sellers spread the articles on the floor.
We went through clothing stores and between two of these stores, a cubicle with a counter where some people expect that from the coal grill on the ember to be ready for the skewers of different pieces of meat stuck in a long toothpick. We snack on Carneiro to deceive the stomach because they start to be hours of dinner. We are walking attentive to the restaurants, which in the distance are distinguished, as marked by red round lanterns.
Hotel Avenue
It is on Hongqi Lu Street, where most hotels are found, which due to the appearance we chose the restaurant, after going through many fast food, both Chinese and the two main foreign brands. At the entrance, a part of sales abroad with a lot of demand, we refer to being in a good place. Thoughts disguise the waiting time, when they tell us to be the pre-payment restaurant and there is no list to choose the dishes. Meats already cooked are mostly barbecue and are exposed in the sales sector, behind glass.
Five in the afternoon and already with the passwords bought for the meal, chosen by the dishes of the tables of customers there for dinner. We are served to tofu soaked in soy sauce and a halted hazeln ease with meat stuffing, floating in a soup. Cheap food to serve as dinner after the job.
Smoken in flavor, we are interrupted by a corcovered beggar of a certain age that seems to ask for money. Offering what we are eating, so all the food is emptied for the bowl and not even the sauce. Faced with such hunger, found later when we saw her in the stairs to eat, we still offer you money to another meal.
Mendicity is a recent phenomenon in China, although there have always been two types of people who walk through the streets and seem beggars. Those who vague live their fate, indifferent and whose people offer them food and those who in poorer places migrate to cities. Of course there are already beggars as well.
The sound of music comes out of stores and the foreign fast food restaurant uses a powerful column where a young maid dances to the sound of children for children, waiting for them to accompany her.
We tried to prove the specialties of the land and therefore, at the Huzhou Hotel restaurant, of two stars, tasted referenced dishes as local kitchen. We were served a fish flower, fish dish that, after baking in a bittersweet sauce, is twisted with his skin to serve as a flower-shaped chalice and thus presented. But it is at the four -star Hotel Zhebei that an exquisite kitchen gives us a tofu we miss.
The price is cheaper than the previous one. This restaurant had been recommended by two young women, who were waiting for their friends and whom a maid asks for help communicating with us, when we one day we climbed to the second floor of a cooked food restaurant at the table, the vulgar Hot-Pot. Realizing that they only serve vegetables, meat or seafood, to be cooked in the heated pan over a gas nozzle in the center of the table, we get up and prepare to leave.
Requestly ask us in English the reason we leave. Then comes the two young college students in Hangzhou, who lived at the family home. Explaining this is not the food that feels like us, we took the opportunity to ask for other regional food restaurants. Since apologizing to Huzhou for not having many restaurants, they present the best and cheap price the restaurant of the Zhebei Hotel.
After a harrowing and as it is early, as in China starts dinner at five in the afternoon, we returned to the avenue and then the hotel from where we saw another, also four stars, the International Huzhou. Continuing on the same ride, we found the Tian Yun silk store. Then a brush store, where there is for all sizes and prices, reaching porcelain or bamboo cable brushes, costing thousands of yuans.

Diving into Huzhou's past, entering one of the city's most picturesque streets. A Christian church dominates the street and around, stores occupy the part under the two -story houses. By the solidoes in the heads of some people, we realize that some of the business belong to Muslims. After refusing to be photographed, a tangerine salesman offers us a delicious fruit piece. Continuing, curiosity leads us to meet the stone bridge with three arches built in 1539, with some embedded ornamental stones.
Hence and to southwest, we go to the garden of the painter and calciple Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) Painter Museum. This was native of Wuxing (today Huzhou), named after courtesy and pseudonyms Songxue, Oubo and Shuijinggong Daoren. He was a descendant prince of the Song Dynasty, but he served the Mongols Yuan Dynasty as an official at the Hanlin Academy.
As a painter, he specializes in the representation of horses and used recreating themes and styles of the old masters, with simple colors to make the landscapes. In addition to being a master of Tang Dynasty techniques, he was an excellent Caligraph, considered one of the main four in the history of Chinese calligraphy.
Already in the garden, the serenity with which the green of the vegetation is combined in the lake with the brown of the rest pavilions, or in the woods of the tea houses, makes us there a long time, recreating figures with the reflection in the waters of the ornamental stones. We have to leave the garden to visit the Brushes Museum which, despite being encompassed in the same room, has an autonomous entrance. Huzhou brushes are referenced as the best in the country and so you have to see how they are made.
In chronological terms, the brush was invented in the late 3rd century A.N.E. By Meng Tian, a military commander of the Qin Dynasty. However, it is perceived by the painted vessels of different neolithic cultures, which must have existed for at least five thousand years. Therefore, Meng Tian will be linked, not to the invention, but to the improvement of brushes. Also the city of Huzhou is not the real place of production of the best brushes, but has won this title since in ancient times Shanlian, in the municipality of Wuxing, province of Zhejiang, was over his jurisdiction. The handwriting brushes made had their heyday during the Yuan Dynasty and are still considered among the best in all of China.
Four steps are required to manufacture the HU brush, and the coat of the rabbit, the fingernail and the goat hair is used. After the fat is removed with tire juice, the hair is cut into equal sizes and enter a solution to clean them. They are then united at the base with arabic gum and after drying, united with a tile that unites them to the bamboo.
With the brush made in its structure, the other phase of the process is passed. The hair is bumped to a porridge made of algae to put them together and with the wire wrapped a tip is created, the most important part of the brush. This wire that goes through the hair, on a lap gives the cone shape and also serves to remove the excess of the agglutinator papa.
With extreme patience and skill, the brushes are clean, rounded, creating a tip, with good elasticity. Then the brush, ready, passes to the hands of another employee, where in the bamboo cable are recorded the characters Tian Kuan Trade Mark, which replaced the old “double goat” brand.
The goat hair (HAO) brushes (HAO) are soft and serve to write small characters, rabbit hair are hard and those of the fingernail are between the two, with great elasticity for the handwriting of large characters. Sometimes a mixture of different hair is made, using those of other animals.
There are brushes of all kinds of sizes, serving some to paint and others to call. The best for Chinese handwriting are the rabbit and goat hair mix. HU brushes were widely used in the imperial court.
In the other part of the museum is the painter's room Zhao Mengfu with its utensils and some works, where the recorded stones are not lacking. Although the museum has a sales section, after leaving the museum and already on the street, a set of stores is dedicated to the sale of products for Chinese painting.
Leaving the brushes, we visited the market and crossing a wooden bridge in Zig-Zag, we traveled another old part of the city. Clothing extenders hide salespeople with bags full of tea leaves finished spoon that belong to the first harvest of the year, the best.
Our stay in Huzhou also serves to visit places at an hour of bus, such as Anji, to see the Bamboo Museum and already outside Zhejiang province in Jiangsu, Dingshan, referenced as the place of production of the best tea services. The southern bank of Taihu is the border line between the Huzhou district in Zhejiang province and Jiangsu province, where Lake Tai expands.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Coloane | Government canceled project of the Museum of Paladers 9 years ago</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/coloane-governo-cancelou-projecto-do-museu-das-palafitas-ha-9-anos/</link><description>Long before the authorities were part of the 85 square kilometers of maritime areas, there was the idea of lifting a stilts museum to consecrate this type of existing housing in Coloane. However, years later, the direction of tourism services says that the project will not even move forward, having been suspended in 2016
 
Between 2016 and 2017, the government planned to raise a museum about Coloane's stalps to tell the story of these peculiar houses of Macao. However, after news was published in the press to convey the inauguration of the project in 2017, the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) confirmed to HM that no museum will be born. More: not only will it not be built, but the plan was aborted nine years ago.
“Due to the inclusion of the area where stilts are located in the government's urban planning plan for the coloane riverside, Lai Chi Vun shipyards and Navegantes Street, STD ended the 'Museum of the Museum of the Museum of the House' in 2016, and, subsequently, completed the 'Museum of House Project' procedure. Canceled ”, was referred to in the answer.
The cancellation in 2016 is still surprising, given that on June 14 of the same year the Jornal Tribuna de Macao (JTM) reported that the inauguration of the museum would take place in 2017. In this article, statements were cited by the director of STD, Helena de Senna Fernandes, made to the newspaper or Mun, explaining that the “project was in the [conception] phase of design”. They would have been held, including “several consultations to collect opinions from the residents of that area, expecting to improve the proposal of construction”.
According to JTM, the project should “be completed by the end of the year” in 2016, so that the work will be “started early 2017”, and STD expected “that the construction was completed in the same year”.
After the promise, in 2018 there was still “legal fundamentals” to build the Museum in Coloane, as also reported the JTM. The justification given by the STD was that Macau has not yet had the 85 square kilometers of maritime areas under his jurisdiction, something that has been legislated, precisely, since 2018.
A matter of priorities
HM sought to know the state of the designer of the Museum of Palafites following the recent launch of a book on the collage of Colaane, by Filipe Afonso, coordinator of the degree in Architecture of the University of São José. Now confronted with the official cancellation of the museum project, the official lamented the decision of the authorities.
"The cancellation of the Museum of Slacinas project is not just news about a project that has not advanced, but a starting point to equate Macao's development priorities, the way the heritage is managed and what means for collective memory, in this case of Coloane," he said. In the opinion of the author of “The Colaane Grammar”, “The Plan for the Marginal of Rua dos Navegantes should include proposals for new buildings that use and reinterpret Madeira as the main and essential element of construction”, and the connection of this street with the Lai Chi Vun shipyards, “especially with regard to the sea front, is a unique opportunity to create a coastal corridor that celebrates Colona's seafront history”.
Thus, and “given the richness of context and cancellation of the stilts museum, the focus should be on integrating the memory of these structures into the new plane”, so the existing structures of the shipyards, stilts should be restored, maintaining their original and material characteristics, but adapting them to new uses ”.
Still on the patrimonial value, Filipe Afonso described, in the interview with HM, the proposal to “classify stilts as heritage to give them legal protection”.
"By cataloging existing stilts, the book contributes to preserving the memory of this type of architecture and a broader discussion about its possible protection," he argued, adding that dwellings, many of them left to abandon, "could be reused for experience tourism, or cultural interpretation centers, valuing local history."
They could also “be transformed into creative and artistic spaces or in fact propose new wood buildings along the water line, with various uses and that can generate value to the Coloane community, contributing to Macao's cultural and economic diversification”.
Hopes
Filipe Afonso highlights the process of revitalization and recovery of the Lai Chi Vun shipyard zone as a “initiative with immense historical and cultural value, which refers to the rich tradition of the region's shipbuilding”. In fact, the Lai Chi Vun shipyard zone is one of the “six zones” to recover by the government and operators, which also include places such as the pier in the interior port or Avenida Almeida Ribeiro, among others.
In the area of Lai Chi Vun there is already a leisure zone where cultural initiatives have been carried out, with a museum area that tells the history of the Junos construction industry in the territory.
In this sense, Filipe Afonso asks that “the Macao government does not limit the design of these projects to a restricted range of‘ short-listed companions ””, ie a restricted group of companies.
Also, in his opinion, "Macau has a new generation of talented architects and creative ready to make his contribution." "I believe that through more open ideas contests, these professionals could offer innovative perspectives for the city's urban and cultural challenges. Deleting them from such crucial processes for Macao's urban and cultural development is a waste," he added.
The HM contacted other architects to get reactions to the cancellation of the museum project, but did not get answers.
What the law says
Between the suspension of the project and today a lot has changed. In 2018, Macao arranged from the maritime management bases law, which includes 85 square kilometers of area, and whose principles provides for the environmental preservation of spaces such as those that stilts are inserted.
The legislation introduced concepts such as “functional maritime zoning”, in the sense of delimiting zones “with fundamental and specific maritime functions according to location, natural resources, environmental conditions and exploration and use needs”.
In the list of principles to be complied with, the legislation speaks of something like “protection of the environment of maritime areas”, in order to “protect natural resources and the environment of the sea, realizing the planning of protection and promotion of the marine ecosystem, and the marine protection should be taken into account”.
It should also be “conserving the sustainability of use and development” of these areas, and their use should be done “scientifically”, according to functional maritime zoning ”.
In addition to the concrete legislation that tied the paddle museum in 2016, there was also a direct planning plan to MSAR, something that was implemented in 2022 and also brings new directives for the exploration of maritime zones.
Coloane now has its own UOPG-Operative Planning and Management Unit, where a “rational organization of public infrastructures and collective use equipment” should apply, as well as “appropriate use of soils” in order to create a “coordinated space structure”.
Coloane's UOPG is part of the “ecological conservation zone”, which aims to “protect areas with ecological value” and “contribute to the greater protection of natural resources with ecological value”. Here it will not be allowed “to allocate soils for housing, commercial, industrial, tourist and amusement uses”, reads in the director of the masket.
Coloane's UOPG is also integrated into the “green or open public spaces”, and here should be “maintaining the current use for green spaces and outdoor activities, integrating it [Coloane's UOPG] into the green zone or open public spaces”.
Specifically, Coloane's UOPG should “promote the development of ecotourism and cultural tourism, with the creation of a tours of nature and the 'green and resilient waist', based on the combination of natural resources, namely hills, sea and coastal lines”. It should also “conserve and optimize existing industrial zones, build the 'waist of knowledge - industry - science' and the 'waist of cooperation of a river, two margins' and, simultaneously, rationally plan the housing zones in adequate location, according to the principle of balance between professional and residential functions”, and these points interconnect with the paradise zone, Navigantes Street and Savings Lai chi vun.
The Director Plan also explains that "the predominant use of soils at UOPG Coloane is an ecological conservation zone."</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:11:09</pubDate></item><item><title>AL | New Regiment prohibits deputies from disseminating content of the commissions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/al-novo-regimento-proibe-deputados-de-divulgar-conteudos-das-comissoes/</link><description>With the new Hemiciclo regiment approved yesterday, the deputies are prohibited from publicizing the subjects discussed at the meetings of the permanent committees, except their presidents and secretaries. The subject generated debate yesterday in the Assembly regarding the limits of what may or may not be said. Pereira Coutinho voted against this article
 
The deputies of the Legislative Assembly (AL) are now prohibited from disseminating what is discussed at the Hemiciclo Commission meetings, "anyway," with the exception of its president and secretary. These usually disclose the content of the meetings at a press conference after their holding, and this will keep up.
This new regulation arises after the vote and discussion, generally and specialty, the alteration to the Rules of Al. It was one of the most discussed topics in yesterday's debate, with the deputies arguing on what can or can not be said, having José Pereira Coutinho voted against this concrete article.
The disclosure of information from the meetings, which serves to analyze in the specialty proposals of law and always steering at the closed door, was something that was not yet regulated.
Coutinho began by asking if he could disclose the information "during the plenary meeting", for example, having said that "he never heard of any deputy who had violated that duty." "There have been meetings in the past where the secretaries warned about the information that should not be disclosed and nothing has been said. We are only 33 deputies and we should think of the possibility of revealing what was discussed, because it is difficult to define borders about what can or can not be revealed and this will give rise to many discussions later," he said.
The legislator also pointed out that "it can be difficult to execute this norm" and that "the principle of transparency" should be followed.
Ho Ion Sang, who presided over to the commission that analyzed the new Al Regiment, explained that "the content of the meetings is subject to the duty of confidentiality and this matter was clarified." "The content can be said by the president of the commissions after the meetings, at the press conferences, and journalists can ask questions. In practice remains as always happened and that has given good results," he said.
Meet the meetings
Another point addressed, whether or not the permanent commissions were held at the closed door, and Pereira Coutinho defended the opening to the public like what happens in Hong Kong. The AL regiment does not prohibit open meetings, but this always depends on a prior deliberation.
But iau Teng Pio, deputy, advised against the opening of the meetings. "The purpose of the closed -door meetings is so that members of the government, advisors and deputies can argue at ease even if there is no final decision.
Kou Hoi In, president of AL, recalled that “the spirit of the norm has not been changed” and that everything will stay in it, only the ban on what deputies cannot refer outside the commissions.
"The reserved character of permanent committees is so that everyone can speak freely and if any deputy says this or that can spoil sensations of injustice in society to deputies and this cannot happen. We have to protect deputies and ensure confidentiality."
At yesterday's meeting, there was also the discussion of the duty of the deputy to participate in all permanent committees, even in those to which he does not belong. Several deputies spoke of the need for better coordination of meetings agendas.
"In the future there may be more practical coordination because there are many meetings and proposals of law. We can schedule the meetings so that there are more deputies," he said.
Moreover, the new Al regiment prohibits deputies by "clothing or signs, banners, signs or other objects that have offensive content or political provocation, or undermine the dignity of the AL".</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 23:47:53</pubDate></item><item><title>About 97 percent of Spanish adolescents victim of sexual aggression on the internet</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/cerca-de-97-por-cento-dos-adolescentes-espanhois-vitima-de-agressao-sexual-na-internet/</link><description>About 97 percent of teenagers in Spain is the victim of some kind of sexual violence on the internet, warned yesterday the Save the Children Non-Governmental Organization (NGO).
The NGO released a report yesterday with the title “Networks that hold. Sexual exploitation of childhood and adolescence in digital environments”, which elaborated with the European Association for Digital Transition and which includes official data and an inquiry to over 1,000 young people aged 18 to 21.
According to the study, 97 percent of these young people said they were victims of some kind of sexual violence on the Internet during adolescence, including contacts from adults for sexual purposes, unauthorized diffusion of intimate images or blackmail and threats to send intimate and sexual content.
Another type of violence enhanced in the report is the use of artificial intelligence tools to create sexual content from a real image of adolescents or children (content known as 'Deepfake' or 'Ultra counterfeits').
According to the study, one in five young Spaniards was the victim of the creation and diffusion of these 'Deepfake' during adolescence, namely with sharing by another person, to third parties, and without consent, of their own nudity images, elaborated through artificial intelligence.
"The internet, social networks and technologies not only facilitate capture and exposure to sexual exploitation -related risks, but can be the means by which these violence against boys and girls are committed and allow their perpetuation," said Save the Children, in a statement released from the study published yesterday.
Starter
Social networks are the most frequent way for aggressors to start contacts with the teenage victims, with the study also highlighting online video games in the case of boys. After this first contact, they move to applications and messages of messages such as WhatsApp, Telegram or Discord.
Girls are the ones that most denounce to be pressured to send intimate content (28.5 percent from 18.4 percent of boys), with the study revealing that all victims had shared personal or intimate information on the internet during childhood and adolescence.
According to the study, only 50 percent of young people when they were smaller considered contact with unknown people one of the main risks of the internet and only 32.9 percent mentioned as dangerous the consented send of intimate images to adults.
On the other hand, 70 percent states that it has not seen as a risk, in adolescence, the manipulation of photographs and videos with artificial intelligence. Asked the reasons why they sent intimate or sexual images of themselves, 48 percent says it did not know it was something potentially dangerous, 46 percent weighed that it was normal and 42 percent sought attention, affection or some kind of validation.
Alone at home
In this context, Save the Children warns, in the study, for the lack of follow -up of minors; The scarce digital formation, in cybersecurity, privacy and recognition of danger situations and the intensive use of technologies by children and adolescents.
According to data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Spain, cited in the NGO report, in 2023 there were 4,896 complaints for offenses on the Internet against children and adolescents, 1,068 of which were sexual crimes.
"These numbers represent only the tip of the iceberg, as most cases do not know, in part, for the absence of denunciation and, in part, for the difficulties in detection, which increases when these facts take place in an online environment," said Save the Children Catalina Perazzo, quoted in the NGO statement.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 01:11:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Sao Tome and Prince | Relationship with China is discreet, but strategic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/sao-tome-e-principe-relacao-com-china-e-discreta-mas-estrategica/</link><description>On Saturday, 50 years of the independence of Sao Tome and Principe were celebrated. The future advances to the rhythm of diplomatic relations with other Portuguese speaking countries. For academic Cátia Miriam Costa, the African country and China are strategic partners, despite the description of the relationship between both
 
Researcher Cátia Miriam Costa considers that the relationship between Sao Tome and Principe and China remains discreet, despite being almost celebrating a decade, with growing Beijing's strategic interest in the position of the archipelago in the South Atlantic.
"Since neither country nor another talks much about the subject, we end up not realizing the depth of the relationship well. But I believe it is not yet a very deep relationship," the researcher at the Center for International Studies of ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon, noted to the Lusa.
The geostrategic position of the archipelago, located in the Gulf of Guinea,, however, feeds Beijing's interest, namely in the context of the Chinese bet on the expansion of logistics and sea corridors in the South Atlantic.
"Sao Tome, if it is not a very important port in logistical terms, is a relevant port for control, for example, of piracy, threats. Therefore, this position also certainly reflected by Beijing," he explained.
The restoration of formal ties in 2016, after two decades of Taiwan's recognition by Sao Tome, was a “pragmatic” decision of the African country, and a trump card for Beijing Diplomacy, which always maintained “open channels”, even during the period of removal, Cátia Miriam Costa explained.
"The relationship with China is more fruitful because it brings other counterparts," explained the researcher. "It was also for these counterparts that [in 1997] Sao Tome exchanged the Popular Republic of China for Taiwan, because at that time the Popular Republic of China was a developing country. So it didn't have to offer what Taiwan had, which was perfectly integrated into the international market," he said.
A VOLTE-FACE
In December 2016, Sao Tome officially announced the establishment of relations with the Popular Republic of China, ending the recognition of Taiwan.
The decision caused the immediate cancellation of the scholarships offered by Taiwan to St.-Tome students, many of whom were eventually integrated into the other Chinese universities. China has quickly become one of the main cooperation partners in São Tomé, with promises of investment and support in areas such as education, technical training, agriculture and infrastructure.
The researcher recalled that even before formal relations, Beijing never completely broke with Sao Tome, keeping the country involved in the activities of the Macao Forum, albeit only as an observer, a strategy he considers "typical of Chinese diplomacy." "China does not fully close the doors. It can suspend relationships, but if it is something of national interest, it is usually renegotiated again," he said.
“Limited Results”
Nevertheless, Cátia Miriam Costa acknowledged that the concrete results of cooperation are still limited. “There are more projects in the role than properly ongoing works,” he said, attributing part of the responsibility to the weak institutional capacity of São Tomé, which only recently began to create structures to attract and negotiate foreign investment.
Among the sectors with potential for the deepening of cooperation, the researcher highlighted the fishing, marine resources and eventually cocoa. Oil exploration raises “high risks”, both for technical complexity and environmental limitations.
"China is interested in the region, but it is not because Sao Tome is an attractive market -because it is not -, yes, for its location, stability and integration capacity in a broader regional project," he said.
The researcher also stressed Chinese investment in Chinese language teaching in Sao Tome, which also aims to "create a network of people with language dominance, familiar with culture and potentially useful for the future of bilateral relations." "China maintains a strategic interest in the relationship, even if it does not express it with great visibility. And for a country like Sao Tome, any small help can have a significant impact," he concluded.
Reports of four Sao Tomers who followed courses in China
Denise, Lucineidy, Reginaldo, and Aithysa grew up under the sign of an alliance with Taiwan, until life and academic path were redefined by the rupture of diplomatic ties between Sao Tome and Taipei in 2016.
Denise Aragão Fortes still remembers her hand to Tsai Ing-Wen. It was November 2016, the day of Africa in Taiwan was celebrated, and the official was attended at the time.
It is very likely that behind the scenes would already outline the end of diplomacy between Taiwan and Sao Tome and Principe, but for this student of International Relations at the University of Ming Chuan, Taoyuan, North Taiwanese, the news, who arrived a month after these celebrations, on December 21, was a surprise.
“There was no rumors, nothing,” recalls Lusa Denise, now 29, working in marketing and living in Almada, Portugal.
When the secondary finished, also the bonds between the island and the African nation, agreed in 1997, had just reached the age of adult. There was “very closeness” between the parts, with Taiwanese friendships in the family.
Normality shaken this December 2016. Studying with a scholarship granted by Taipé, Denise and other St.-Tome students in Taiwan was given the option of continuing studies without financial assistance, or being transferred to China as scholarships. Being at the end of the academic course, Denise remained in Taoyuan. Most, however, changed geography, university and life.
Country “full of opportunities”
Lucineidy Almeida, now 28, saw the arrival in Tianjin, northern China, as "a new restart" in a "country full of opportunities." Attending the second year of biotechnology in Taichung, this native of Santo António had some difficulty in following the degree in Mandarin. A limitation that would eventually surpass, evaluates today, but in China, had the possibility of studying in English pharmaceutical sciences.
He says he learned of the diplomatic break through social networks and, like all students who spoke to Lusa, left criticism of conducting the process, with “many uncertainties”, information given “on time”, “a feeling of disrespect”, and, in the middle, the suspension of the bags.
Two months after the announcement, he landed in Hong Kong, where he treated his visa, although he still unaware of what his final destination. Only upon arrival in Beijing was he told that he went to Tianjin, recalls Lucineidy, living today in Portugal, in Cacém, and working as an English and Portuguese interpreter in the medical field.
Regarding the diplomatic interruption, it notes that "from what was realized at the time", it was "a monetary question": "in the sense that China offered more [to Sao Tomé] than Taiwan at the time could provide."
The São Tome Prime Minister of the time, Patrice Trovoada, considered the unilateral break of relations as “the right”, taking into account the authorities' view of the country's development. "We decided the principle of joining one China and when adhering implies the cut of relations with Taiwan. The international scenario 20 years ago, not the same as today," he added.
But the new political order did not take students to advance in the academic career. Aithysa Ramos, 32, is still in Beijing, where, after leaving Taiwan, she concluded the master's degree in business management.
If this morning of 2016, the story had not taken this course, would probably have been in Taiwan, where he had lived seven years ago. At the time, it now remembers the English education teacher, was “devastated and angry”: “It was like my second home, I passed [part of] my adolescence, growth phases”.
Reginaldo was in the second year of Business Management at the University of Yuan Ze, Taoyuan, when he stayed to the news. He realized that he “had no power” to change the course of history.
The initial shock, assumes today, was really the cold. Despite admitting "it was" always a process of doubt, "China, where he moved two months after the cutting cut," it was a surprise for the better. " “Because I was still here, not coming back, I can say yes, it was the best thing that happened,” he says.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:35:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Works | Revitalization of the pier 23-25 and Patio of eternal happiness later this year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/obras-revitalizacao-dos-cais-23-25-e-patio-da-eterna-felicidade-ainda-este-ano/</link><description>There are six historical areas to revitalize with the support and investment of the six game operators, but the deputies question the absence of news about what is being done and the slowness of the projects. The government assured that between the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth will be released more data and completed revitalizations of old zones
 
The revitalization of the 23-25 quay in the interior port area and the eternal happiness courtyard should be completed later this year, being interconnected with the projects designed and funded between the executive and the six game operators for six ancient Macao zones.
The warranty was given yesterday by the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP. "The revitalization of the six zones is a priority task for the government, because we have to rely on the investments of the dealers. We have done studies, made an arrangement of resources and now we know what we have. We want, at the end of the third quarter, the beginning of the four quarter, to be able to advance with more details."
More concretely, it was up to a representative of the Cultural Institute to confirm that the rehabilitation of the eternal happiness courtyard and pier 23-25 is completed at the same time.
Tai Kin IP has ensured that the government “is not stopped” while analyzing and studies. “We have already given instructions [to concessionaires] for the work that can be adjusted. We ask dealers to do the analysis depending on the characteristics of the zones. We will complete the structures [this year], with remodeling and restoration works, and we are working.”
The secretary stressed that the type of consumption is also being analyzed in these six zones, according to the type of tourists, with "two categories of consumption, the traditional and new generations."
“I ask you to accelerate”
Despite the promises of more detail, the deputies regretted the lack of more detailed information. “The essentials is to publicize the projects, because the government has to conduct certain investments and guide the market. Can the government have time to do the studies, but will small and medium -sized businesses take this time from studies? Will stores that are in the six zones continue to explore the activity?” Asked Deputy Ron Lam.
According to the deputy, the ideas for the six zones should result in a “transparent and publicized project to the public”, because “the whole society [has to be heard] so that all projects can reflect the market panorama”.
Another critical voice was that of IP Sio Kai, who asked for a comprehensive revitalization. “Everyone expects changes in the community economy. Concessionaires are committed to the six zones, but have passed two and a half years [since the announcement of the projects]. Of course there has been transition work, but there are new conception plans and everything should be done at the same time. For example, there may be obstacles to the conception of plans, because we have the street of happiness very close to the courtyard of eternal happiness, and it can be revitalized the surrounding areas. Of the six zones?
It should be noted that the six zones concerned include Rua da Felicidade, Pier No. 23 and 25 of the Inner Port; the surrounding area of Avenida Almeida Ribeiro and Rua de Cinco de Outubro; the bar area near the dock D. Carlos I; Lai Chi Vun's shipyards in Coloane, and the Zone of Fortaleza do Monte.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 00:38:44</pubDate></item><item><title>BRICS | Seventh Cimeira ends today with focus on Trump's fares</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/brics-setima-cimeira-termina-hoje-com-foco-nas-tarifas-de-trump/</link><description>Since Saturday, leaders of the countries that are part of the BRICS Group have been gathered in Rio de Janeiro for another summit designed to think about the reform of institutions and inclusion of more emerging economies, as well as the fight against Trump's rates.

Since Saturday, Rio de Janeiro hosts the BRICS Group leaders, which ends today. The first day was based on the dialogue around the ambition of emerging economies to reform international institutions and the defense of multilateralism.
"I think the main message is this: at the time of so many international crises, conflicts, we are experiencing a succession of conflicts that only increase from year to year, having a set of countries reaffirming the power of diplomacy, cooperation, the need to act jointly, to solve the problems of the population and not to generate more destruction, such as conflicts, it is an opportunity that we always have to take advantage of," Lyrio, guide of discussions and agreements of heads of state at the conference, designated by the Brazilian presidency of the BRICS.
In all, about 30 countries and nine international organizations have been present, with the Brazilian head of state, Lula da Silva leading the meeting, which has Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Angola President and African Union, the Secretary-General of United Nations, António Guterres, among others.
The main absences are Russian and Chinese heads of state, two BRICS founding countries.

From China with Love
According to Chinese state agency Xinhua, Chinese prime minister promised to “expand cooperation with Brazil” in the areas of “digital and aerospace economy”. Li Qiang spoke on Saturday, as part of a meeting with Lula da Silva, noting that the country intends to “work with Brazil to take advantage of each other and expand cooperation in areas such as digital economy, green economy, scientific and technological and aerospace innovation”.
Xinhua quotes words from Li Qiang, who referred to the fact that “China is ready to work with Brazil to continue efforts to enrich the dimensions of bilateral relations and achieve more concrete results in cooperation in order to provide more benefits to both peoples”.
One of the points out of this meeting was the realization, in 2026, of the year of China-Brazil culture, which provides for an intensification in cooperation in areas such as “education, youth and health”, in order to facilitate “more exchanges between peoples and strengthen public support for China-Brazil's friendship and cooperation”.
“China is willing to work with Brazil to further consolidate and deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, finance and infrastructure development within the high quality cooperation of Belt And Road [track and route]”, the Chinese prime minister, who did not forget the great flag of this BRICS Summit: multilateralism.
Thus, I read Qiang considered “the two countries as fierce defenders of multilateralism and free trade”, saying that “China is willing to improve communication and coordination with Brazil in multilateral structures such as the United Nations, BRICS and G20, work in union with developing countries to promote an equal and ordered multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and provide more certainty and stability to the world. ”
On the other hand, Lula da Silva said that "Brazil is willing to deepen communication and multilateral coordination with China, to oppose unilateralism and defend multilateralism and free trade in order to promote peace and world development." After the meeting between the two leaders, “cooperation documents in areas such as tax and financial matters, artificial intelligence, alignment of development strategies and aerospace” were signed.

Cuba's debut
Cuba President Miguel Díaz-Canel also participates in the 17th BRICS Summit, being the first time Cuba has associated with this geopolitical and economic cooperation group.
Under the motto “reinforcing cooperation in the global south for more inclusive and sustainable governance”, the BRICS Summit's agenda comprises two central axes: the consolidation of cooperation between the global southern countries and the promotion of reforms in international governance mechanisms.
Created in 2009 throughout Brazil, Russia, India and China, BRICS admitted South Africa two years later and, since last year, integrates six new effective members: Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Iran, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. Brazil invited to this summit leaders from various Latin American countries, including Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay and Chile.
The status of associate, which takes Cuba to Rio de Janeiro, was approved in October 2024 during the summit of the group held in the Russian city of Kazan, which was made official in 2025, recalled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean country.
In addition to geopolitical issues, BRICS have sought in Rio de Janeiro in the organization's economic weight, namely in the financial domain, in which they have been looking for a dollar for years for trade in the group.
The host president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, president of Brazil, stressed last Friday the importance of a mechanism with these characteristics, recognizing, however, that the current international political context is "complicated".
What is on the agenda
On the first day, the heads of state and government of the BRICS participated in two plenary sessions, particularly on "peace and safety and reform of global governance" and the second relative to the strengthening of multilateralism, economic and financial affairs and artificial intelligence. "
In the latter, the revision of the enthusiastic participation in the World Bank, the realignment of IMF shares [International Monetary Fund] and the increase in the representation of developing countries in leadership positions in international financial institutions and the importance of reforming the UN Security Council.
In addition, as it has been happening during the BRICS ministerial meetings over the past few months, an increase in unilateral unilateral unilateral protectionist measures should be made in reference to the measures announced by the President of the United States, Donald Trump; as well as an appeal to reinforce the use of local currencies in trade between the bloc countries. Today the plenary session will be on “Environment, COP30 and Global Health”.
The term BRIC was created by a Goldman Sachs analyst to refer to emerging economies who began to stand out worldwide beyond the US, and the BRICS first gathered at the level of heads in 2009. This is the first meeting that brings together the new group configuration with 11 member countries.
Brazil has mobilized about 20,000 military personnel, as well as fighters with missiles, anti-drug systems and elite shooters to ensure the safety of the event. The safety operation, called Operational Command Redeemer Set, also provides for the use of 300 vehicles, 38 armored vehicles, 18 boats and eight helicopters.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 04:58:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Cape Verde | Évora family, between Macau and the rest of the world</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/cabo-verde-familia-evora-entre-macau-e-o-resto-do-mundo/</link><description>Tomorrow are 50 years of Cape Verde's independence, the country from which the first levada of the Évora family came out in the 1940s, towards Macao, where he won roots. Nowadays, only one member of the family remains in the territory, the cardiologist Mário Évora
 
There were once a dozen Évoras in Macao, where they arrived in the 1940s, but only Mario Évora resists, with the family repeating the migrations that mark both Cape Verde and the Macanese.
"We have been between eight and ten Évoras in Macau," Sports Medicine expert Humberto Évora told Lusa from Lisbon, where he has lived since he renovated. The maternal grandparents of Humberto (the last of the family to be born in Cape Verde) and Mário (the first to be born in Macau) arrived in the east in the late 1940s, with five of the couple's six children.
A year later, the daughter who had stayed with her husband in Cape Verde came to Macau, already with baby Humberto. The initial plan was for two years, but the couple ended up three decades and have three more children: Mario, Rui and Maria Helena.
In 1971, it was the turn of Humberto and Mário to leave to study medicine in Lisbon, but not without a great fright linked to the colonial war that had lasted a decade ago.
"As we went to the university we could postpone military inspection, but the papers did not come from Macao and we risk being considered refractory," said Humberto. The situation resolved, but Mario admitted to Lusa the fear of the mobilization. "We had this persecution, we had to go through the year not to go with the sides in the war," he explained.
“The Shock” in Lisbon
Upon arrival in Lisbon, “we were soon welcomed and integrated into the Cape Verdean student community,” said Humberto, at a time of student agitation and politics. "There were periods when it was almost daily, manifestations of students against the regime, the shock police enter the canteen inside and give some suckling," said Mario.
Humberto admitted that "it was a shock, for those who came from Macau, where there was little political culture and the colonial war was seen as a struggle against terrorists." In a summer, the young man, who was integrated into a Cape Verdean group of intervention music, left with a friend "to the overseas ride out of guitar on his back."
“I always remember the first time in France, that I saw the colonial war described on the contrary on television, the struggle for the liberation of a colonial power of occupation,” said Humberto.
Independence
When the two brothers finished the medical course, the independence of Cape Verde, on July 5, 1975, led them to the root return. "There was a movement of many of our colleagues to contribute to a new country, which was beginning to take the first steps," said Mario, then a formed cardiologist.
Also because, recalled Humberto, some of the friends of Lisbon had, however, became members of the Government of Cape Verde. "There was this possibility, but the return to Macao, a place where it had spent so long, was natural," he explained. “I was born in Cape Verde, I spent part of my life in Portugal, I grew up in Macao, I am also Macaense. I am a citizen of the world,” said Humberto.
Macanese are a Euro-Asian community, most of which Lusodescendants, with roots in Macau, although many have emigrated, due to the economic situation or fear created by the transition from Portugal Administration to China in 1999.
From the Évora brothers, Rui, engineer, left before the transition to Cape Verde, where he even worked on the project of the Macao Hotel David Chow built on the beach, but was inaugurated.
The younger sister, Maria Helena, a documentary science expert who has even worked in the Macao Historical Archive, is currently in the City Council of Oeiras. The children “are all out” between the United Kingdom, Cape Verde and Portugal, said Mario. "Now the world is smaller and it is going where there are opportunities," he said.
Humberto also faces migrations "as a natural process, not only for Cape Verdeans, but even to the Macanese."
Nothing that has prevented the two brothers from keeping their ties with the archipelago. Humberto divides the time between Portugal and Cape Verde, and has been the official doctor of Cape Verdean sports for decades to the main international competitions.
Mario was one of the founders-and president for ten years-of the Macau-Cabo Green Friendship Association. "We had here Ildo Lobo, Tito Paris, and my cousin," said the cardiologist, before taking a break and adds, with a smile: "Cesaria Évora."</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:18:00</pubDate></item><item><title>DSAMA | GUARANTEED QUALITY OF WATER SUPPLY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/dsama-garantida-qualidade-do-fornecimento-de-agua/</link><description>The Directorate of Maritime and Water Affairs Services (DSAMA) ensures that "the quality of water provided in Macao fulfills the standards." The position was taken in response to the Macau Daily Times newspaper, as a result of doubts about the water quality of the Jiangmen public network.
In recent days there have been several complaints inside due to the fact that the water of the tap supplied in Jiangmen comes with a yellow or brownish color. The issue was explained by local authorities with the adoption of new procedures in water disinfection and treatment. The explanations did not prevent several images from circulating online and in the official media.
In Macao, indicates the Macau Daily Times, 90 percent of water comes from the Xijiang Modaomen waterway, located in Zhuhai. However, strange waterway extends to a section of Rio Ri, which passes through Jiangmen.
Regarding these aspects, DSAMA has ensured that together with the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) controls the quality of the supplied water and that there is a joint safety mechanism with the interior, for emergency cases on water quality. This warning mechanism, the authorities explained, works by classification of emergencies to varying degrees, which require different answers.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:49:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Water | Ordient Tight supervision after recent scandals</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/agua-pedida-supervisao-apertada-apos-escandalos-recentes/</link><description>The four locally bottled touched water episodes that failed quality and security tests led the deputy to ask for greater control of the products in Macau and to ask for new ways to test the waters
 
Deputy Song Pek Kei appeals to the authorities to reinforce the water quality control measures in the territory. This is how the Legislator linked to the Fujian community reacted to recent locally bottled waters who do not comply with quality or safety standards.
At the interpetement, the deputy wrote to expect authorities to contribute to ensure the quality of bottled water in Macao and correct existing inspection failures.
And one of the problems identified by the deputy involves the way water quality control is done: “Although the institute for municipal issues regularly make random inspections, most of these inspections are made through analyzes to water samples, so the safety of the production line and water -recycled carboys is not controlled,” wrote Song.
Since early May, authorities have revealed at least four cases where different brands of bottled and distributed water in Macao did not meet standards and quality. The targeted brands are the Iceblue water, from the Oi Kou Pou Factory, brand Ieong Iat Tat, from the factory of the same name, the water Sun, from Miram Group, and NK water from the NK drinking water factory.
Under these cases, which were detected by AMI, Song Pek Kei acknowledged that measures were taken to deal with the different situations. However, it criticized the lack of a broader quality and safety control mechanism.
Repeated cases
The deputy linked to the Fujian community was concerned about having been identified "so many cases" in a short time, which contributes to a "social concern" in the face of the supplied water.
Song Pek Kei writes that another of the population's concerns aims at the water available in public spaces, in which the carboys often do not identify the water supplier, do not present the results of the latest water quality tests, nor the recommended date of water consumption.
In addition, Song wants the government to make available in public spaces the date of the last cleaning of the machines that provide water from the carboys.
For this reason, the legislator expects the government to ask the water suppliers to fix labels with information in the water carboys. In addition, the deputy asks the machines to be clean and kept regularly, especially in public spaces and services, such as schools, hospitals and homes for the elderly.
One of the waters aimed at quality problems has seen the M-Mark certification, a seal of quality administration, has been suspended. On this aspect, Song Pek Kei considered that this type of certification must always be dependent on quality tests so that products in Macau can develop a stronger reputation.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:45:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Finance | Public accounts with loss before the reinforcement of social support</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/financas-contas-publicas-com-prejuizo-antes-do-reforco-de-apoios-sociais/</link><description>Public accounts presented in June losses of 289.4 million patacas, a record contrary to the trend since the beginning of the year. Between January and June, the MSAR has an surplus of 11.4 billion of patacas
 
Public accounts show a loss of 289.4 million patacas in June, even before a budget revision to reinforce social support. However, when the period between January and July is considered, data from the Directorate of Finance Services (DSF) show a surplus in public accounts of 11.4 billion. This value represents a 2.5 percent drop compared to the end of May, when Macau had a surplus of 11.7 billion patacas.
Still, the surplus of the city between January and June was 40.3 percent higher than in the same period last year and is already higher than the government forecast for the year 2025: 6.83 billion Patacas.
Macao closed 2024 with an surplus of 15.8 billion patacas, more than twice the one recorded the previous year.
Macao's public expense fell 8.2 percent in the first half of the year, compared to the same period of 2024, to 41.4 billion patacas. The only reason for the fall was spending on social support and subsidies, which decreased 17.7 percent to 20.7 billion patacas.
But the Legislative Assembly approved on Wednesday a government proposal to increase by 2.86 billion the expenses provided for in the budget to reinforce social support. The review includes the creation of a subsidy, totaling 54,000 patacas, for children up to 3 years, to raise the lowest birth in the world.
Smaller recipes
Macao current revenue also fell 0.95 percent in the first half of the year to 52.3 billion patacas. The main reason for the decrease was a drop of 62.3 percent to 520 million patacas, in the “property income”, a heading that includes the revenue of land concessions.
On the contrary, the revenues of taxes on the game - which represent 86.4 percent of the total - rose 1 percent to 45.3 billion patacas.
The six city game operators pay a 35 percent direct tax on the game's revenues, 2.4 percent for the Social Security Fund and urban and tourist development, and 1.6 percent delivered to the Macao Foundation for cultural, educational, scientific, academics and philanthropic purposes.
The total revenues of Macao casinos reached 118.8 billion patacas in the first half of the year, 4.4 percent than in the same period of 2024. On April 15, Sam Hou Fai admitted to fear a budget deficit in 2025, due to the slowdown in game revenues.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:42:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | Leona Lee believes dependence will continue</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/jogo-leona-lee-acredita-que-dependencia-vai-continuar/</link><description>Academic Leona Lee believes that the government's major projects won't be enough to reverse the economy's dependence on the game. The opinion was shared by the economy teacher to Radio Macau.
"What government is trying to do is just increase the size of the cake. We know that the performance of casinos activity is increasing, but there are also the other things. But, if we look at GDP composition [Gross Domestic Product], we also have 4 more years, and in terms of GDP calculation, we should not expect a very obvious or effective change of GDP composition," Lee said.
The projects aim to build the International Tourist neighborhood, the extension of the airport, the bet on a research and development center and the enlargement of the University of Macau to Montanha Island.
The Académica also argued that it is not recommended that the government wants to intervene in the composition of GDP, because it can undermine other policies, such as attracting qualified frames abroad, due to the need to adjust the sources of management of management to future reality: “The government does not have to impose its own view of the structure of revenues. Because the game has a fixed rate. Thus, if the game's revenues, the tax, the tax, the tax. It will increase proportionally, ”he explained. "But if we think of the other sources of government revenue, these would be taxes on income, taxes on societies. I think that if these taxes increase, it will want to want to attract people to invest in Macao," he added.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:40:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Transport | Ron Lam wants new evaluation of special taxis</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/transportes-ron-lam-quer-nova-avaliacao-de-taxis-especiais/</link><description>With special taxi licenses awarded in 2017 and 2018 to end in 2028, Deputy Ron Lam wants the government to make a new assessment of whether the adopted model is the best for Macao's population. The subject is approached through a written interpellation of the deputy.
Special taxis aims to allow a telephone transport vehicle, or through the taxi center, and also serve people who need special travel care.
According to Ron Lam, the government should rethink the model and consider whether there will be more beneficial alternatives to the population. If it should be concluded that the elimination of the special license system is more beneficial, Lam wants the government to point out alternatives.
Regarding the complaints of taxi drivers, the deputy points out that drivers complain of the obligation to reach services marked at least 30 minutes in advance, a measure imposed by the concessionaire after the report of the audit commissioner. Before that, the minimum in advance was 10 minutes, which allowed to serve more customers.
In addition to these issues, Ron Lam points out that Hong Kong authorities will approve legislation to enable transportation through mobile applications. The deputy wants to know if there is intention in Macao to follow the same path and plans to move with a public consultation.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:37:38</pubDate></item><item><title>FSS | Retroactive social support paid this month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/fss-retroactivos-dos-apoios-sociais-pagos-este-mes/</link><description>The Social Security Fund (FSS) will pay this month the retroactive to its beneficiaries related to the increases in the amount of the attributed social support.

Now we have Totourgencies. Nothing more, nothing less, than the hospitals of hospitals in the country. There is always more than an urgency closed. On weekends the pour is crazy, especially pregnant women. The scandal is installed when we were shocked that a pregnant woman lost her son because he walked from hospital to hospital to see which one had the urgency of open obstetrics.
At the very least, each weekend are six urgency closed and have been ten. There is no understanding for the Ministry of Health to spend millions of euros and does not solve a pressing problem and of vital importance in a country where birth has only lowered. Pregnant women should be the only citizens who should not have an urgency not even closed.
To the point that many pregnant women have delivery inside the ambulances, because Totourgencies is to walk hospital in a hospital to see which one falls in luck to appear with an open obstetric urgency. The increase is remarkable due to the closure of obstetric emergency services and pediatrics in various hospitals.
In some cases, pregnant women are transported to more distant hospitals due to these unavailability, and delivery occurs during transportation. In the last year, about half a hundred babies were born in ambulances. And because we talk about ambulances, we are facing another serious problem because a large number of ambulances are in a high risk of accident risk. There are ambulances without review and maintenance, with tires requesting replacement and with drivers protesting with INEM responsible that it is no longer possible to conduct ambulances in such a poor condition. Once again, the guardianship makes merchant ears and government propaganda only knows how to announce that it is spending a lot more money on health.
What? In dermatologists who earn a day 50 thousand euros? In managers who are dismissed on suspicion of corruption in the acquisition of hospital material? In miserable salaries to good surgeons who eventually move to the private?… The millions disappear and help to citizens is becoming worse and worse. Inquiries are continuing on the deaths of people without relief during an INEM strike. When in our opinion, Inem, doctors and nurses could never strike. A few days ago, in Bragança, a 69 -year -old woman died of alleged fault in the help of INEM after suffering a stroke.
The patient took more than two hours to enter the hospital, because there were no ambulances available in Alfândega da Fé, in Bragança district, and the patient dying. Still last Thursday, a pregnant woman waited 40 minutes for help from INEM, when the pregnant woman was taken to the hospital the baby was born in the ambulance, but would die. The cases succeed and the Minister of Health is not fired and was reappointed in the new government by Luís Montenegro. This, when the last scandalous case of lack of help has to do with the lack of helicopters in the service of INEM. A public tender announced last year has not yet led to the purchase of any aircraft. Currently, it is only a heli of operational INEM in the country, something unbelievable.
And what did the minister do? He agreed with his defense colleague that there was an agreement with the Air Force so that military helicopters could transport the sick. In principle it could be a provisional solution. But the incompetence and the lack of knowledge of reality reigns. A military helicopter raised a flight, rescued a sick and headed for the nearest hospital, arrived there did not land because the heliport was small, built to the small helicopters that INEM had. The military heli went to another hospital and the scene repeated until it landed in a place near a hospital and an ambulance transported the patient. Imagine how long it has been lost with all this maneuver and can no longer count on the Air Force Helis. And this is not shameful? Isn't it reason for the minister's resignation?
To get an idea of Totourgencies last weekend, seven urgencies were closed on Saturday and eight on Sunday, being one of pediatrics and the remaining gynecology and obstetrics, indicated the Portal of the National Health Service (NHS). The urgencies of obstetrics and gynecology of the hospitals of Barreiro, Setúbal, Vila Franca de Xira, Santarém, Aveiro and Leiria were closed on Saturday and Sunday, while those of Hospital de Abrantes closed on Sunday. In the hospitals of Amadora-Sintra, Loures, São Francisco Xavier-Lisboa and Braga ended the emergencies of the specialties referred to at night to the weekend.
With this national scene, government concern remains the sale of TAP, Alcochete Airport and TGV to Spain. There is no ass already to take it ...

Gathering the pieces of such refined and urgent thinking also requires some daily loneliness and routine that can collide with the dispersion thrown into the most trembling layers of a certain humanity that moves too much and builds very little. More: that has not been correlated for a long time, facts, dialogues and prophecy, and lives in the dust of days with disconnected characteristics in the face of temporal design. And what is it for, whoever turns it on and turns to, unravels and connects what is evidently this experience that focuses on the abyss and its magnitude? Some novels that build their arcas and carry all species in the hope that the waters lower, tears cease, blood does not run, and which may well be advanced versions of salvation.
The prologue, that text that is needed to decode, appears to us as a portal to another dimension never before seen in the intertwined version between reflection, poem and science, a great column where we will later enter so as not to leave until the last breath, and we all know, although no one denounces it, how difficult it is to reach a book with six hundred pages, but the diagonal form of reading can also be considered as a positive agent in order The greed of many readers, and the more it is done, the more stacked of books you stay, and this is a beautiful atmosphere, as much as much, requires respect. Today we have to know how to catch a ride from the cloud a certain winged awareness that condenses to another manifestation all the things we long to know. From stone age to artificial intelligence, a whole script to which the author adds, a brief history of information networks.
There are eleven chapters: 1- What is information? 2- Narratives: Unlimited Nexos, 3- Documents: Paper tigers also bite, 4- Errors: The Fantasy of Infallibility, 5- Decisions: A Brief History of Democracy and Totalitarianism, 6- New Members: What distinguishes the computers from Gutenberg Press, 7- Rlentless: The network does not sleep, 8- Fall: the network is often fooled, 9-democracies: We are still able to talk? 10- Totalitarianism: The total power to algorithms? 11 - The Silicon Curtain: Global Empire or Global Spinning?
We are in a time of reversal where budgets for defense increase at great speed, but at the beginning of this century the world expense in health was higher than that of defense, everything rushed to the maximum degree of the narrative of the dangers manufactured, and this erupting Belicista calls the citizens to draw conclusions without the drag of the delirium of offensive voices that intend to teach people for their real circumstances.
We clearly understand that nothing will be like this - exemplarily explains the book in question - which still underlines the coup of the algorithmic state. Our psychosphere has already changed dramatically, and it is not regressive, the surrounding limbo will not give us any perennial concept about our exploits, nor the audacity of any rebellion will be heard on the coming surfaces. Intrepid stagnation is the starting point for erasing the stormy idealism of our civilizations once and for all, and it is happening.
This work shows how much we are and is brilliant to correlate all the facts where the epilogue is as exemplary as the prologue. The nuclear seems to us a heavy system, difficult to put into practice, but the lightness of artificial intelligence transmitting networks will defeat it. This human ours is in collision with something even unlikely in his most visionary dreams. For us to be, Nexus indicates some ways.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:42:21</pubDate></item><item><title>The door of the stars (III)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/10/a-porta-das-estrelas-iii/</link><description>“Beginning Immedialy, Stargate will be builtish the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of advancements in ai, and this will include the construction of colossal data centers.”
Donald Trump
For Elon, AI is, on the contrary, an existential threat to be controlled and contained, to prevent its power from freeing and annihiles human consciousness. In short, which for Trump is the door of the stars, for Musk is the way for hell not even very paved with good intentions. Altman knows, and so it touches the right strings.
And it puts Elon "the most inspiring entrepreneur of our time," according to the definition of the OpenAi chief in the face of a choice, to follow the rules of the game written by the tycoon, thus content to be one of the many names written in his Cencelli manual, or quitting everything and persecuting "universal palkingness." There is no third option. But the tension points between the founder of Spacex and the stargate men do not end here. Musk didn't like Trump's joke about Larry Ellison either and Tiktok. Asked about the possibility of buying the Chinese application by the businessman, the US president initially avoided responding. But then he replied that he wouldn't mind either if Oracle bought him by stating that "I would also like Larry to buy him."
The Tiktok case, which has been accelerating in recent months, can therefore be another element of friction between Musk and Stargate men. After avoiding the closure of the application, prolonging its service life for seventy -five days, Trump launched his proposal. Fifty percent of the Chinese social network should end in American hands. Compared to 2020, when the intention actually seemed to ban the "Chinese application", the president changed his position.
The merit is also from his granddaughter Kai who, as a skilled golfer and content creator, made Tiktok come 'in the heart', who believes the application was fundamental along with his frequency of podcasts, suggested by the young Barron to win the vows of young people. Therefore, the president would not want to ban it, but to include it in a broader deal with Beijing. Too bad Musk anticipated. The news, in fact, never commented by Elon, of a possible interest of the founder of Spacex in the purchase of the application was provided to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal by "Chinese authorities" not specified.
Attention, these are not personalities linked to the Chinese company Bytedance, which controls Tiktok and with whom Elon Musk continues to maintain narrow relationships. These figures defined musk as a perfect "intermediate", implying that the two parts concerned that, China and the United States could trust him. And looking well, Elon's only tweet really seems like a negotiation opening because he says that "I have never been in favor of Tiktok's ban, but I do not understand why it can operate in the United States and the X cannot operate in China."
Elon had made his proposal that he guarantees to the president Tiktok, but exchanges, open the Chinese market to X. It was at this time that Trump intervened, specifying that at least officially the sale of Tiktok should be negotiated with Bytedance, not "Chinese authorities" not being better specified. And, above all, the president points out that the app can also be quietly bought by Larry Ellison, who, incidentally, manages the Tiktok cloud in the United States through Oracle and was very close to buying it in 2019.
Which means' Elon, we don't need you. Neither for the AI nor for Tiktok ». SIC Transit Gloria Mundi? Not yet. But Musk is trapped. And in his ears they resonate both Altman's "Trump or Humanity" dilemma and Masayoshi Son's categorical imperative, known as the "This is not just business." In short, it's time to put the United States first.
Regardless of transplanetary, universalist or more prosaically Chinese dreams. Trump made his play, crowning himself "technological king" of America. Now it will be up to the great technology tycoons to organize themselves in accordance. If they want to challenge each other with innovation, that's fine. If Zuckerberg, although excluded from Stargate, considers investing sixty -five billion in AI, very well. The president will not hurt those who were left out of the star door. On the contrary, as a true medieval sovereign, it will offer water, earth and deregulation. But vassalage relations and national interest should not be questioned. Anyone who thinks about using politics to pursue their interests exclusively, whether Martians or Chinese, is wrong.
And those who believe that his star can shine more than the president's is very mistaken, because Donald is convinced that "it was saved by God to make America big again." Obviously, it will not be easy. The technological companies that Trump is trying to federate are simply very powerful. And it is always the Lord who depends on the servant, especially if the latter is able to produce technological gadgets capable of leading humanity to Mars or overcoming human intelligence.
Stargate is therefore a social experience, before being economic, technological and geopolitical. If the protagonists of American technology ie a dozen billionaires, all with obvious behavioral disorders are willing to collaborate with each other and with the government, then the American dream could be reprogrammed. If, on the contrary, chaos and grudge prevail, America will die, collapsing itself. Exactly as a star.</description><pubDate>2025-07-10 00:32:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Promote moderately diversified economic development</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/promover-o-desenvolvimento-economico-moderadamente-diversificado/</link><description>Macao opportunities and responsibilities from the perspective of young entrepreneurship
Wun Kong Law *
Kacee Ting Wong **
It is a widely recognized fact that the Macao game sector is under increasing pressure from the emergence of new game centers in neighboring regions. Even more worrying is the so -called “exclusion effect” caused by the excessive preponderance of the game industry, which makes it difficult to attract talent and the growth of game -related sectors, generating structural imbalances and obscuring the prospects of sustainable economic development. At this key transition moment, Macao must break decisively with the habit of rooted dependence over the years and adopt an innovation posture and initiative to promote moderate economic diversification.
This way is not just the right way to ensure robust long-term development, but it is an inevitable strategic choice for Macao to be proactively in the new competitive scenario. The strong commitment of the Government of the Special Administrative Region (MSAR) in the development of Mountain Island (Hengqin) and support for local entrepreneurs demonstrates that economic diversification has become one of the priorities of current governance.
For a long time, the high profits from the game sector generated, in some individuals and local companies, a dependence mindset, leading to a passive attitude of waiting for opportunities within the game's value chain, to the detriment of an active exploitation of new emerging sectors. This conservative mindset, resembling invisible currents, not only limits Macao's progress on the way to economic diversification and social innovation, but also weakens its ability to resistance to external shocks.
It deserves attention that certain companies remain too faithful to their traditional operational models, neglecting the formation of their innovation capacity and improving their adaptation to market dynamics. Once the external environment changes, they are severely affected, highlighting the urgency of transforming mental models and welcoming a culture of renewal.
Therefore, we argue that the commitment of business fabric in promoting economic diversification is as essential as - or even more pressing - the efforts of the government government to reduce the dependence of the game sector. Young local entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises should assume a central role, breaking with the mindset of comfort and becoming the driving force of industrial transformation and innovative development.
A paradigmatic example is that of Mr. Fu Tanglong, president of the Macao Digital Industry Research Institute and Executive Vice President of the Macao Living Transmission Association. Since the beginning of the Great Bay initiative in 2019, Mr. Fu has decided to launch himself inside China to undertake, moved by his confidence in electronic trade, actively exploring the economic opportunities provided by new technologies.
Through its training programs, it assisted more than 350 small and medium -sized companies in its digital conversion and provided training in digital marketing and in -moving transmission to about 4,000 young people. This practice demonstrates well the entrepreneurial spirit that combines the courage to explore the strategic vision with the use of comparative advantages. His success experience proves that, with proper professional training and taking advantage of Macao's unique geographical position and political environment, young people can open new horizons in electronic trade, developing personal careers and contributing to the region's economic transformation. In 2023 alone, the Mr. FU -led association helped Macao's local traders reach a sales volume of over $ 16 million (source: macaubusiness.com, December 10, 2024, “the entrepreneurship journey of a young man from Macao”).
Other inspiring examples of young entrepreneurs abound. Mrs. Huang Yin has been dedicated to the promotion and dissemination of traditional Chinese medicine in the territory; Mrs. Chan Nga Law, in turn, founded the company E.C. Film Production Company Limited, contributing in recent years to the development of the Macao film industry; And young talents like Leng Ka Chan and Oscar Chan Tianlan were elected in August 2024 by Macau Post as "great bay excellence entrepreneurs." These young entrepreneurs, actively exploring the unique cultural and historical resources of Macao and developing projects with strong local identity, prove the immense potential of innovation anchored in tradition. These success cases are inspired by companies to reinforce investment in research and development, valuing Macau's historical-cultural heritage and combining their traditional specificities with contemporary creativity, with a view to creating innovative products with macanese identity.
The active response of these individuals to the “Moderately Diversified Economic Development Plan 2024–2028” and the Government of the Government guidelines represents, in practice, the realization of the “four hopes” expressed by President XI Jinping in December 2024: to boost moderate diversification of the economy; Raise the effectiveness of governance of the special administrative region; Build opening platforms to the highest level outside; and safeguard social stability and harmony. Strategic attention attributed to the development of Mountain Island clearly reflects the prominent place that economic diversification occupies in the current governance. According to statistical data, the Guangdong-Macau in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin already hosts more than 56,000 commercial entities and more than 10,000 technological companies, constituting a fundamental pillar for Macao's economic transformation.
The new Government of MSA has attributes great importance to the expansion of economic and commercial relations with Portuguese -speaking countries, having foreseen, in its first year, an official mission to Portugal. Secretary for Economics and Finance, Mr. Tai Kin IP, recently stressed that the role of Macao as a bridge between China and Lusophone countries is irreplaceable. It also reiterated that the region will enhance its connection platform, with emphasis on the development of the technological industry as a strategic vector to achieve economic diversification (China Daily, June 27, 2025). It is also important to mark the growing role of macanese students in Portugal, who have become dynamic protagonists of the exchange between Chinese and Portuguese societies.
Promoting a renewal of mentalities requires the collective effort of all sectors of Macanese society and a coordinated advance on multiple fronts. Individual, Macao residents should cultivate a prospective view, break with conventional professional models and acquire emerging sectors specialized skills such as digital economy, creative industries or traditional Chinese medicine, continually reinforcing their competitive advantage. Companies, as protagonists of economic development, should abandon passivity, adopt a proactive posture of transformation, reinforce investments in technological innovation and product investigation, and strengthen cooperation with the interior of China and international markets. At the same time, they should seek to deepen their connections with the large bay and the outdoor markets, converting Macao's advantages as a platform into concrete business opportunities.
In fact, the private sector, for its efficiency, flexibility and competitive orientation, plays a particularly relevant role in the realization of economic diversification. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that many companies face the problem of high financing costs, which can limit their investment capacity - as has been widely discussed, including academic publications such as the Blue Sky Blog of Columbia University Law School. To respond to this difficulty, the Government of MSA has launched the “Young Entrepreneurship Support Plan”, offering interest-free loans to young people with entrepreneurial spirit but with limited resources, thus providing them with substantial support. This measure translates the governance view of paving the way to youth and reinforces the social consensus that young people should take advantage of this favorable conjuncture and get out of their “comfort zone”.
Most importantly, young people, who live this crucial moment of transition, must consciously assume the historical mission of leading Macao towards a model of sustainable and diverse economic development. Instead of questioning “what can Macau do for me?”, Should question “What can I do for Macau and my country?”, Cultivating an attitude of initiative and service, making national and regional prosperity its vocation.
The new generation should break free from the dependence on a single job in the game sector and widen their professional horizons, betting on continuous learning and improving their skills-not only as a requirement for personal development, but also as imperative to optimize the region's talent structure and promote social progress. From the national strategic point of view, the development of Hengqin will also contribute to the deep integration of Macao in the Great Bay. The firm and continuous application of President Xi Jinping's important guidelines will allow Macau to safely follow the right path traced by national policies towards a promising and predictable future.
As history teaches us, the periods of difficulty are also aptly moments for consensus consolidation and overcoming with determination. Macao is in a historic crossroads. Breaking with inertia, renewing concepts and redefining the course of development is not just urgent - it is unavoidable. In this context of transformation, we must all firmly support the policies of the Government of MSAR in the economic and social domains. Given the inevitable challenges of economic transition, the Macanese society must unite, strive with conviction in the process of diversification, and promote, with innovative spirit and social cohesion, the modernization of the productive structure.
If, as Dickens wrote, the worst times are also the best, then Macanese entrepreneurs should not lose confidence in the face of adversities, but will face them with courage and creativity, adopting innovative management models capable of responding to the challenges of economic transition and technological progress. Society as a whole should abandon immobilism, face changes with bravery and turn difficulties into opportunities. Only with the concerted action of individuals, companies and authorities will it be possible to take steady steps on the moderately diverse economic development, writing a new chapter in the history of Macao - a lasting prosperity chapter and sustainable progress.

From an abandoned and lost space in history, the Green Island Convent, former Jesuit House in Macao, has now become a culture space, hosting from July 24 its first event: the Macao Experimental Film Festival, organized by the CUT Audio-Visual Association. There will also be exhibitions at Cinemateca Passion.

With this thematic focus, this year's festival features eight programs with new local orders, thematic screenings, interactive cinema and live performances,” is described on the poster. The organization thus invites the public to “challenge the privileged relationship between the public and the screen, encouraging the reflection on the role of moving images, the mechanisms of image production and their dialogues with the world around us”.
Highlight for three series of the “Made in Macao” section, which this year presents the commission “Transparent Landscape Project”, in which four local artists and filmmakers were invited to explore tangible and intangible 'landscapes' through personal experiences and research on local history ”, which is“ questioning the dynamics of power between the House and the City, the presence and absence, colonialism and the colonialism and the colonialism and the colonialism and the colonialism and the colonialism and the colonialism and the colonialism and the colonialism and the colonialism and the colonialism and the colonialism and transfer of sovereignty, the human and the non -human ”.

In question is the requirement for environmental impact assessment for the construction of the viaduct between zones A and B of new landfills and information on the eastern east line. Experts point out that UNESCO recognition has boosted cultural tourism in the territory
 
Tomorrow, the 20th anniversary of the Entry of the Historic Center of Macau is celebrated on the World Heritage List of the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO). It runs until next Thursday, in Paris, the 47th Convention of the World Heritage Committee, where the mashes is represented by the Cultural Institute.
At the end of last week, during the UNESCO Convention, the Committee issued a monitoring resolution to the State of Macao's Heritage Conservation. In addition to some compliments, the international institution calls for the comprehensive environmental impact assessment regarding the construction of the viaduct that will connect zones A and B of new landfills, especially a part that may violate the height restrictions around the guide headlight.
The issue of buildings for ending the sidewalk of the guide and the construction of the Light Metro Line line were also topics on which the World Heritage Committee requested additional information, pointing out as a delivery time of all documentation on December 1, 2026, the Tribuna de Macao newspaper (JTM) reported.
In a statement issued on Friday night, the Cultural Institute indicates that “it will follow relevant resolutions and submit to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee the documents related to the monitoring of relevant projects for analysis, according to the general communication mechanism in the past”.
Documentation will be delivered through the state administration of China's cultural heritage.
Unnatural
The JTM also indicated that the UNESCO Committee enhances the commitments and efforts made in the Historic Center's safeguard and management plan, with a view to implementing previous requests from the international organization. However, it regrets that it was not heard, as requested, before it came into force in early June last year.
In the statement on Friday, the IC does not mention the repair of the UNESCO Committee, but that it congratulates the MSAR authorities for the formal entry into force and the implementation of the safeguard and management plan and the work of conservation, monitoring, interpretation and exposure of Macao heritage.
History and Game
Experts consider that the classification of the historic center of Macau by UNESCO has boosted cultural tourism in the territory, supporting the diversification of an economy traditionally dependent on casinos, but warns of challenges in promoting heritage.
Na Tcha's temple and the ruins of Sao Paulo are side by side in the historic center of Macau. Early in the morning, families pose to the chamber at the bottom of the iconic stone staircase of the ruins.
“I like the sidewalk [Portuguese], it's special,” says Lusa Alina Wang, a Shanghai tourist. The eight -year -old son York Xiong adds: "The buildings are beautiful." Not everyone in the family, however, knows the story behind Macao's "former libris", reduced to the facade after fires. The patriarch, I read Zijian, was going to swear that it had been destroyed during World War II. Beside, another family, this from Xi'an, associates the image of the ruins with a Japanese bombardment in the Great War.
20 years ago, on July 15, 2005, the Historic Center of Macau, a set of 22 monuments that combines Portuguese and Chinese architecture, joined the UNESCO World Heritage list.
This milestone for the city's heritage, Lusa tells the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD), brought more tourists to Macau, changing the profile of the visitor, who stopped crossing the border just to play.
"This changed the image of Macao from a" city of the game "to a cultural destination, differentiating it in the Asia-Pacific region," said the STD.
A study to STD visitors this year reveals that 53.3 percent of tourists arrive in the territory to visit the heritage, surpassing those who want to shop (33.7 percent) and those most interested in gastronomy (18.5 percent).
For IP FEI Law, historian and former member of the Macao Cultural Heritage Council, the UNESCO Statute raised Macao's global profile. "The game has boosted the economy in the short term, culture should boost long -term growth," he told Lusa.
Amusement park
But if, on the one hand, the inscription of heritage came to help diversify the tourist's profile, you have to think of those who live in the city daily, noticed Ka Nok Lo, vice president of the Macao Heritage Ambassadors Association.
In an interview with Lusa, the official warned of the need not to turn Macau “into a Disneyland”, defending the balance between tourism and the needs of residents. "Museums should serve the community, as are libraries, bookstores, not just tourists," he said.
Ka stressed, on the other hand, that the visitors still remain the narrative that unites the various places distinguished by UNESCO. "There is no story that turns on these monuments," he said.
The Macao government has as one of the main objectives to seek economic diversification, in order to reduce its dependence on the game industry through the development of new sectors.
But the appeal of the casinos is unavoidable, such as the families of Shanghai and Xi'an have highlighted. The day after the Macao Historic Zone tour, the visit to the region would continue in the modern resorts of the game concentrated in the Cotai, highlighting the double role of Macao as a gaming destination and cultural heritage.

Former President of the Macao Representation of the China Industrial and Commercial Bank (ICBC), Jiang Yisheng, is being investigated by the interior authorities, being in uncertain whereabouts due to facts practiced in Macao and calls with businessman NG Lap Seng. The news was advanced on Friday by the Caixin Global newspaper, a publication of the interior.
Hours after the information, which initially indicated that Jiang was incontabinently and missing, the Central Disciplinary Inspection Commission confirmed that Jiang Yisheng is being investigated for “severe violation of discipline and law,” a term normally used in corruption -related investigations. In addition to the Central Committee on Disciplinary Inspection, the investigation also involves the Zhuhai Municipal Supervision Committee.
According to Global Caixi, the investigation aimed at Jiang Yisheng deals with real estate loans approved by the Macao ICBC, especially the luxury project Windsor Arch, built ahead of the Jockey Club and in which several local entrepreneurs participated.
This was a project developed by NG Lag Seng, then president of the group Sun Kian IP, and was also part of the investigation within the judicial case that resulted in the judgment of former public works directors, Jaime Carion and Li Canfeng. Also Ng Kei Nin, son of NG Lap Seng, one of the company's directors, was implied in the case. Both were convicted in Macao to comply with prison sentences.
Growing
Global caxin indicates that the investigation comes at a time when ICBC Macao has an increase in evil credit, ie the loans that have been approved to debtors who later cannot pay debts.
The Macao ICBC will also have filed shares against the goods of NG Lap Seng and NG Kei Nin due to money borrowed to the not returned business group. Among the assets that are the target of seizure are about 80 parks of parking, 40 offices and bank deposits and actions on the stock exchange evaluated by more than 1.7 million patacas.
Jiang Yisheng, who was president of the Macao ICBC between 2018 and 2023, was also aimed at a bank's internal disciplinary proceedings, which began in early 2024 due to loan approval without the necessary guarantees.
In 2019, during the presidency of Jiang Yisheng the Macau ICBC was distinguished by Fernando Chui Sai On with the medal of industrial and commercial merit. Jiang Yisheng received the distinction of the then chief executive.
Alongside Banco da China, China's construction bank and China's Agricultural Bank, China's Industrial and Commercial Bank is part of the group of four major interior banks, considered as the main ones in the country. In addition, ICBC is a state bank.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:51:59</pubDate></item><item><title>DRUG | Man detained for consuming methamphetamines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/droga-homem-detido-por-consumir-metanfetaminas/</link><description>A man about 30 years old was arrested by the Judicial Police, and is indicted for the crimes of illicit consumption of scholars and psychotropic substances and improper possession of utensil or equipment. The case was released yesterday by PJ and the detainee is a non-resident worker of Indonesia employed in a cleaning company.
The situation was discovered after the PJ had another man and a woman at the beginning of the year, who trafficked studded. The investigation showed that the most recent detainee was one of the clients of the other two people. The detention was made last Tuesday, in the central area of the city.
In the individual's house was found a bag with methamphetamine, in a small dose, as well as smoking instruments. The urine test also presented a positive result. To the authorities the man confessed to having the habit of drugging.
PJ | CROUPIER detained for being accomplice in burla
A CROUPIER was detained for circumventing the casino where it works in conjunction with two players from the interior of China.
The blow caused $ 123,000 losses from Hong Kong to the casino, according to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, which cited information from the Judicial Police (PJ). The case was discovered after Croupier was allegedly reported to allow the two players to bet after the result was known, which yielded 6,000 Hong Kong dollars to gamblers.
The suspicion also helped one of the suspects to leave a $ 60,000 bet from Hong Kong, instead of collecting the chips, giving rise to 120,000 dollars of Hong Kong in the next play. The suspects were arrested on Wednesday and were in possession of 118,000 dollars of Hong Kong in game sheets. The suspects confessed to the facts, stating that the money from the scams had not yet been divided. However, the PJ believes that there was at least one more person involved, who is on Monte.
Game | Detained after being taken to exchange money
Two men were arrested after being caught up making an illegal money exchange. The case was revealed yesterday by the Public Security Police (CPSP) and quoted by the newspaper or Mun. The men from the interior of China were taken to exchange money for an agent in a routine operation.
The exchange involved a total amount of 213,900 dollars of Hong Kong and 400 patacas intended for the game, which constitutes a crime. The two suspects were accused of exploiting illicit exchange exchange rate, which can be punished with a sentence until 5 years in prison. The case was referred to the prosecutor.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:31:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | Citigroup warns that increased revenue will have little impact on profits</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/jogo-citigroup-avisa-que-aumento-de-receitas-tera-pouco-impacto-nos-lucros/</link><description>The investment bank shows great confidence in the Macao game market and states that it deserves greater recognition of investors, since the "appetite" by the casinos is far from decreasing
 
Although gross game revenues have 8 percent growth in the second quarter of the year, the Citigroup investment bank estimates that the repercussion in the dealership results will be moderate. The position was left in the investment bank report, quoted by the GGR Asia portal, which, despite the conclusion shows a lot of confidence in the game's future.
"Our estimates point to the growth of 8 percent of the game's gross gross revenues in the second quarter translates into the 3 percent increase in results before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortizations [EBITDA, in English]," the report signed by George Choi and Timothy Chau. "We believe that the lower growth of the sector's EBITDA in relation to GGR has more to do with a slightly unfavorable combination of revenues - since the concerts well advertised appealed not only to premium mass players, but also directly to VIP players," he was added.
Citigroup also explains that the slightly unfavorable combination of revenues is the fact that VIP players who played in Macau bet less money within the market segment with greater financial power.
In the second quarter of the year, revenues reached 61.115 billion patacas, plus 8 percent compared to the same period, when revenues had been 56.427 billion.
Confidence signal
Regarding the large investments of concessionaires in concerts in Cotai, Citigroup analysts do not consider that they are diverting money from the earnings. "We believe that [the undoing between revenues and gains] has little to do with promotional activities among the six operators, which we believe to remain largely stable," they wrote.
In addition, the investment bank draws a positive scenario of the industry: “It is encouraging to see the Macao game market generate positive growth of both the gross game fears and potentially EBITDA,” he was highlighted. "The" appetite "of the players remained strong despite geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties and, in our opinion, the macao game sector deserves more credit from investors," he was added.
Analysts also pointed out that the second quarter of the year was the one that reached the largest revenues, with an average of 672 million patacas per day, since the end of covid-19 policies in early 2023.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:28:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Culture | TRAINING COURSES IN SEPTEMBER</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/cultura-arrancam-em-setembro-cursos-de-formacao/</link><description>The Culture Development Fund (FDC) will organize, between September and October this year, and in collaboration with the University of Tourism of Macau (UTM), “Business Training Courses in Cultural and Creative areas”, and registration will take place between July 14 and 8 August.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad for us, in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
Também eu preferia que, em francês, fossem premiados o Pascal Quignard, a Linda Lê ou mesmo o Sollers, ou, de entre os novos, o Mathias Énard, mas isso não tira dignidade à obra de Annie Ernaux (e bastaria ter escrito o “Les Années”). Há livros dela de que gosto menos, como o vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, mas isso acontece com quase todos os autores, têm livros-charneira e outros que são como intervalos no seu itinerário. Aconselho a leitura de um belíssimo livro de entrevistas com ela, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club Narrative Prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my rank of hatter at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

The Lusitano Club of Hong Kong, with about 400 members, has been available Portuguese courses for about five years, but the initiative “is not official”, the president said to Lusa, the institution, Patrick Rozario, who now wants to bring more quality to the institution's offer.
In this sense, Club Lusitano and Ipor signed, on Thursday, in Macao, an agreement that, among other purposes, wants to reinforce collaboration in teaching and learning Portuguese. “In the future, the Portuguese classes we offer in the Club will be under the guidance and approval of IPOR. We will continue to do what we have done, but IPOR will help us with the material and program,” said the president of the largest institution in the Hong Kong Lusodescendant community, founded in 1866.
Rozario also expects in the future to make the courses available for non-member. For now, specifies, “members and friends” - including 'Visas Gold' - have resorted to the linguistic program. "It seems that we have more and more people interested in attending Portuguese classes," said the Lusodescendent, noting that, in the last "four, five years", they passed there between 30 and 40 students.

About this partnership will work, the director of IPOR explained to Lusa that the courses will be organized by IPOR - including teaching programs and methodology - and trainers guided by the institution. "When issuing a certificate of the learning of these courses, which are made at Club Lusitano, the seal of IPOR has been departed, and the seal of IPOR offers the quality," he said.
Still with regard to the protocol signed on Thursday, Patrícia Ribeiro spoke of the intention of “strengthening collaboration in the cultural area and holding events” in Hong Kong. "We are invited to participate in fairs or festivals (…) like the consulate [of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong] does not have a office [in Hong Kong], but only one person -and it is not every day -the Lusitano club will be a support to develop these activities and promote Portuguese language and culture," he noticed.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 02:21:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Suriname | Xi Jinping Felicita Elected President</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/suriname-xi-jinping-felicita-presidente-eleita/</link><description>Chinese President Xi Jinping yesterday congratulated Jennifer Geerlings-Simons for his election as president of Suriname, who considered as a “strategic cooperation partner in China in the Caribbean region”.
In his congratulations message, quoted by the Chinese Official Agency Xinhua, Xi Jinping pointed out that the two countries have lived “solid and constant growth, with practical and fruitful cooperation in various areas and a close coordination in multilateral matters” since the establishment of diplomatic relations for 49 years.
The Chinese head of state stressed the “great importance” that it attributed to the development of bilateral relations between China and Suriname and, according to EFE, was available to work with Geerlings-Simons. Work with the elected president of Suriname intends to “deepen friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation, as well as boost the bilateral strategic partnership of cooperation,” he said.
Jennifer Geerlings-Simons was elected president of Suriname last weekend, becoming, at age 71, in the first woman to lead this South American country, in a suffrage where she was the only candidate for office.
Geerlings-Simons was elected by Parliament, after the National Democratic Party (PND), to which it belongs, allied to five small parties to get the two thirds of votes necessary to access the presidency of Suriname.
Geerlings-Simons's investiture for a five-year term in front of the country with about 600,000 inhabitants is scheduled for July 16.

The incident occurred on Wednesday, when a Chinese bomber fighter JH-7 approached a Japanese Electronic Intelligence aircraft YS-11EB at a distance considered insecure by the Japanese authorities, who presented a formal protest to Beijing over the maneuver.
Chinese Ministry of Defense spokesman Colonel Jiang Bin said Japanese recognition aircraft have entered the east of China air defense identification zone on "multiple occasions" to perform "approach recognition."
This air zone - which includes the Diaoyu islands, run by Tokyo, but claimed by Beijing - was announced unilaterally by China in 2013 and is not recognized by neighbors Japan and South Korea.
"Chinese military aircraft, in accordance with the law, performed identification, tracking and surveillance checks, and all corresponding actions were completely legitimate, reasonable, professional and in accordance with the regulations," said Jiang Bin.
The spokesman stressed that such “approximation and interference” activities by Japanese ships and aircraft “are the root cause of the risks for air and sea safety between China and Japan”.
"We hope that the Japanese side will advance in the same direction as China and create a favorable environment for the stable development of bilateral relations," Jiang said in statements quoted by Chinese state television CCTV.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 02:08:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Australia | PM is with Xi in a new approach to Beijing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/australia-pm-encontra-se-com-xi-em-nova-aproximacao-a-pequim/</link><description>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Friday that he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the visit to China, centered on the reinforcement of bilateral economic relations.

China has dismantled 300 dams and ended most hydroelectric plants in Chishui-an important tributary from the Yangtsé River-to protect threatened fish species and restore the ecosystem, official press said Friday.
According to the official news agency Xinhua, until December 300 from the 357 existing dams at Chishui, also known as Rio Vermelho, were removed. In addition, 342 of the 373 small hydroelectric plants were deactivated, allowing several rare fish species to retract natural reproduction cycles.
Over 400 kilometers long, Chishui crosses the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan, in southwest China, being considered by ecologists as one of the last refuges for rare and endemic species from the Yangtsé upper basin.
In recent decades, the intensive construction of dams and hydroelectric plants has restricted downstream water flow and, in some sections, has caused the flow of flow, according to Xinhua. A situation that destroyed natural habitats and spawning zones, as well as blocking the migratory routes of various piston species.
Zhou Jianjun, professor of hydraulic engineering at Tsinghua University, explained that the closure of the centrals does not necessarily imply the physical demolition of infrastructure. "Most importantly, after the production of electricity, the mode of water management can be changed to meet ecological needs," he said, quoted by Xinhua.
Come to life
The agency added that since the beginning of ecological rehabilitation work, in 2020, species such as the Yangtsé stubble have recovered the habitat and vitality.
This species, declared extinct in nature by the International Union for Nature Conservation in 2022, was affected by the construction of dams and the development of river navigation since the 1970s.
However, researchers from the Chinese Academy Hydrobiology Institute of Science, led by Liu Fei, recorded encouraging recovery signs.
According to Xinhua, two waves of yangtsé sturctions were released in Rio Vermelho in 2023 and 2024 and were able to successfully adapt to the natural environment. Last April, the researchers released 20 adult sturctions in a Rio section in Guizhou, having recorded natural reproductive behaviors and the outbreak of eggs.
"This feat demonstrates that the current ecological environment of Rio Vermelho is now suitable for the habitat and reproduction of Yangtsé's stubble," said Liu Fei. The institute's latest data reveal a significant increase in aquatic biodiversity in Chishui, with greater diversity of fish species detected in various sections of the river.
Protection measures
Since 2020, China has implemented a series of measures to protect Yangtsé, including a ten -year moratorium on fishing and the regulation of hydroelectric plants.
In late 2021, the province of Sichuan completed the restructuring of 5,131 small centrals, ending 1,223, according to an official report, quoted by Xinhua. Local authorities also banned sand extraction in watercourses in an attempt to preserve aquatic habitats.
In a statement issued in August, the Chinese government indicated that aquatic biodiversity has constantly improved since the adoption of these measures, especially the recovery of fish, invertebrates and amphibians.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 02:04:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | Beijing calls for respect for the rights of two detained Chinese citizens</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/ucrania-pequim-pede-respeito-pelos-direitos-de-dois-cidadaos-chineses-detidos/</link><description>The Chinese government yesterday asked to “respect the rights and interests” of its citizens, after the Ukrainian authorities informed the detention of two Chinese citizens, a 24 -year -old man and his father.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning has stated at a press conference that Chinese authorities are still “checking information” without providing further details.
The Ukraine Security Service (SBU) reported that the two citizens "tried to illegally export to China secret documentation" regarding the R-360 Neptuno systems, an anti-vintage cruise missile manufactured by the Ukrainian weaponry company Kiev's state design workshop, better known as "Luch".

China is building 510 Gigawatts (GW) of large-scale solar and wind projects out of a total of 689GW worldwide, indicated the Non-Governmental Organization Global Energy Monitor (GEM), which monitors global energy infrastructures.
“China is leading the overall expansion of renewable energy,” reads the report. The Asian country “continues to add solar and wind capacity to a record pace,” he said.
The growth of clean energy in the country is crucial to combating climate change, given China's dominant role in world industrial production. The country is responsible for about one third of global greenhouse gas emissions.
According to GEM, China should add at least 246.5gw of solar energy and 97.7gw of wind just this year. By the end of March, the country already had 1.5 Terawatts of installed solar and wind power capacity.
In the first quarter of 2025, these sources represented 22.5 percent of total electricity consumption, according to the National Chinese Energy Administration.
Strong bets
Although it continues to develop new coal centrals - having started building the largest number of units of the last decade in 2024 - China has been strongly betting on renewables, both to reinforce energy safety and to reduce imported fossil fuels.
According to GEM, about 28GW of the renewable capacity under construction come from the wind energy 'offshore', which can help decarbonize industrial centers and megacities in coastal regions.
"Despite representing only a fraction of the country's total wind power capacity, the wind energy is gaining strength as coastal provinces set ambitious decarbonization goals," the report said.
The expansion of electricity is also transforming the country's energy model. Increased use of cars and electrical trains means that a growing portion of the energy consumed is provided by electricity, leading some analysts to describe China as the world's first 'electrified state'.
Beijing is expected to announce new climate commitments before the next United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP30), which will take place in November in Belém, Brazil.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:34:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Free Trade | China and Asean prepare a new version according to</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/livre-comercio-china-e-asean-preparam-nova-versao-de-acordo/</link><description>The new free trade agreement between Southeast Asian countries should be completed by the end of the year
 
Southeast Asian foreign ministers yesterday expressed, in Kuala Lumpur, the intention to reinforce economic cooperation with China and modernize the Beijing Free Trade Agreement, signed in 2010.
The bilateral meeting between the heads of diplomacy of the countries of the Southeast Asia Nations Association (Asean) and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi took place on the sidelines of the Asean Regional Forum, which also has the presence of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
"Through the updating of this agreement, Asean and China will strengthen their economic cooperation and resilience during this difficult period and in the future," Malaysia Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan said before the meeting with Wang Yi, marked by the context of the commercial war with the United States. The new version of the treaty, known as “version 3.0”, should be completed by the end of the year.
The head of Malaysia Diplomacy, a country that holds this year's rotating presidency of Asean, also stressed that the regional bloc should “remain vigilant before threats to an open, fair and rules-based commercial system”, in an indirect allusion to the rates imposed by Washington.
Founded in 1967, ASEAN consists of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar (former Burma).
Tariff Game
Throughout the day, ministers should also meet with Marco Rubio, at a time when the United States has announced new tariff increases to several Southeast Asia countries.
The new rates, which come into force on August 1, increase rates on Malaysian products (24 percent to 25 percent), Philippines (from 17 percent to 20 percent) and Brunei (from 24 percent to 25 percent). For Indonesia (32 percent) and Thailand (36 percent), the values remain compared to the announced in April.
Washington has, on the other hand, reduced the taxes on imports of Cambodia (49 percent to 36 percent), laos (48 percent to 40 percent) and Myanmar (from 44 percent to 40 percent).
Singapore maintains the base rate of 10 percent, while Vietname is the only country in the region who has reached an agreement with the United States, benefiting from a reduction to 20 percent compared to the 46 percent initially announced.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:32:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Taiwan | Beijing applies export controls to military companies</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/10/taiwan-pequim-aplica-controlos-de-exportacao-a-empresas-militares/</link><description>China yesterday imposed export controls on eight Taiwan defense companies, as it aims, according to Beijing, to protect national security, the day they start the largest military maneuvers on the island.

Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that the willingness already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy.
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary general has ensured that he had “pleasing to work with all parties,” but stressed that this is a “decision that is up to central governments to make” and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, it is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new fund's new direction "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, in this case, the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibilization of the rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish-speaking institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo.

Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything that someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the appropriate place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macau, Camões has been poorly enjoyed in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | FIA AFINA REGIONAL Formula Rules</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/gp-fia-afina-regras-da-formula-regional/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) took advantage of the holding of the Extraordinary General Assemblies and its annual conference to publish the Macao Grand Prix Regulation - FIA Regional Formula Cup of 2025. There are not many changes compared to 2024, but the changes introduced aim to browse gaps from the first edition of this competition in Macau
The twelve red flags during last year's qualification session called for the level of pilots at the Guide Circuit, which was the premiere of the FIA regional formula in Macau regional formula. This happened after the controversial decision of the FIA to consider that Formula 3 was no longer adequate to the Macao Citadino layout.
Unsurprisingly, the sports regulation is now clear that, to compete in the FIA regional formula world, “all pilots must have participated at least 3 competitions with a monolugar that has been projected and/or built to reach a weight/power ratio of more than 3.0 kg/hp.”
Emanuele Pirro, a former F1 pilot, winner of the Guide Race and president of the FIA monoligai committee, said during the weekend of the 71st edition that, in the future, the FIA will be more demanding about track discipline. Thus, from now on, “any pilot who, in the opinion of sports commissioners, is solely responsible for the display of a red flag during the qualification training session, will not be able to continue to participate in this session and its best time back can be annulled.” The new regulation also states that “if a qualification training session is interrupted with less than four minutes remaining, it will not be restarted.”
On the other hand, the FIA maintains the limit in the participation of more experienced pilots, except only “pilots who participated in a maximum of 3 FI F2 Championship competitions of 2025.” This measure goes a little against the spirit and history of the Great Prize, which has always gathered pilots from higher categories in its main race. In fact, this was a fervent question between Macao and the International Federation on two previous occasions.
In 1985, Alfredo César Torres, then responsible for Portuguese motorsport, convinced Jean-Marie Balestre, against his will, to allow the participation of F1 pilots in the F3 Intercontinental Cup in the name of the economic viability of the race. In 2016, the controversy returned with the veto da FIA to the participation of Nelsinho Piquet, a decision badly received by the teams and then coordinator Barry Bland, which would eventually abandon the co-organization of the race a year later.
Bet on continuity
In sports terms, registrations for this second edition of the FIA regional formula Cup will remain open until July 30. The grill may include a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula monologues, all equipped with Alfa Romeo engines built by the Italian Autotechnic. Pirelli will once again be the official tire supplier.
The identities of the invited teams have not yet been revealed, but some news is expected in this field compared to 2024. To avoid any behind -the -scenes disputes, it has already been defined that “the position on the boxes for the teams that participate in the Macao Grand Prix will be based on the ranking of the previous year” and, in turn, “the position in the roadway for new teams will be attributed based on the order of application.”
Equal awards and more restricted advertising
The values of monetary awards remain unchanged this year, with a total of US $ 68,500 to distribute, the equivalent of just over 550,000 patacas at the current exchange rate. The race winner will receive $ 12,000, an amount that is still far from covering the costs of participation in this nature.
On the other hand, the sports regulation introduces two new prohibitions on advertising into the monoligales. In addition to the existing prohibition of advertising to fortune or bad luck, tobacco or pornography, also the promotion of electronic cigarettes and alcoholic beverages - a measure that follows the legislation in force in the territory.
The 72nd Macao Grand Prix, the largest international sports event of the MSA, will take place between November 13 and 16, 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 03:31:16</pubDate></item><item><title>FIA | Conference helped perceive future of motorsport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/13/fia-conferencia-ajudou-a-perceber-futuro-do-automobilismo/</link><description>For the first time in its history, in 2025, Macau welcomed the Extraordinary General Assemblies and Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). Organized in partnership with the Macau-China General Association (AAMC), the FIA-affiliated sports territory, and the Galaxy Entertainment Group, this event brought together more than five dozen FIA senior delegates from 147 countries in the field.
 
In the Galaxy International Convention Center, to this day, the future of motoring and mobility worldwide is discussed. However, some details about the future of sport in the territory have already been revealed between the lines. Focused on obtaining information about the growth of motorsport and promoting safe, sustainable and accessible mobility to everyone in the Asia Pacific region, the FIA conference opening session highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration, as well as the region's ability to innovate and create solutions that respond to specific questions it faces.
Roberto Carlos Osório, president of the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), said the association has a strong tradition in motor racing and that following FIA's guidelines is being able to grow rapidly competition at the base level in the region.
“We organized the first GT Macau Cup in 2008,” said the AAMC leader. "Currently, we also have the GT Cup - Great Bay Race for GT4 cars. In addition, in 2008, we created Road Sport Challenge," he explained. “And today, in 2025, we are proud to announce that we have 68 tourism cars in the region to compete in the qualification race to enter the 72nd Macao Grand Prix.”
In a year when AAMC celebrates 30 years of existence - was born as Macao Automobile Club - we also learned that the association's bet for the future will be in the basic disciplines of motor sport. Roberto Carlos Osorio also revealed a curious fact: Macau has 135 pilots with sports license from the territory.
“This growth was achieved following FIA's guidelines to promote grassroots motorsport and create accessible races for riders in the region,” added the manager of the territory. “With the interest of pilots, teams and promoters in developing state-of-the-art activities in Macau, we will focus even more on base competitions and affordable races, not only to support tourism, but also to make Macau in a Karting international center of international events, where champions can be selected for F4 and, later, for regional formula.”
Confirmed GP program
The Macao Grand Prix Organizing Committee (COGPM) held a press conference on June 8 at the Macao Grand Prix Museum to confirm the 72nd Macao Grand Program races, which will take place from November 13 to 16 this year.
As last year, there will be seven races in total, respectively, the Macao Grand Prix - FR da Fia World Cup, the GT Macao Cup - FIA GT World Cup, the Macao Guide Race - Kumho Fia TCR World Tour Event of Macau, the Formula 4 Formula 4 World Cup, the 57th Macao Motor Motor Prize, GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge. For the first time, the guide circuit receives four different cups under the FIA seal on the same weekend.
Other news
Between meetings and communications, other information was revealed about the November edition of the Macao Grand Prix. The FIA World Council approved in Macao that the winner of the first Formula 4 World Cup of the FIA will receive two points for the super license. We have also noticed that Pirelli will equip all the monologes that participate in both the FIA Formula 4 World Cup and the FIA regional formula World Formula Cup. In turn, the supply of tires and fuel to the FIA GT World Cup remains in the contest phase.

Of the twenty -eight vacancies assigned by the first two GT Cup races, only one Macao pilot got a direct entrance at the great sports event of November.
Following the success of the two races played under the China Formula 1 Grand Prix, both 30 -minute races of the GT4 Chinese Championship had a total of 21 participants at the event held at the International Circuit of Lago Ruyi in Pingtan. This picturesque track, located in Fujian province, replaced the Zhuhai International Circuit, initially included in the provisional calendar released in January, but did not confirm the holding of his event.
In Pingtan's semiurban layout, Chinese pilot Han Lichao won both races behind his Toyota GR Supra GT4 EVO2. In two very lively races, Kevin Leong Ian Veng (BMW M4 GT4) was the only Macau pilot scoring, having reached a sixth and eighth place, respectively.
Although only one Pilot of the Misrem has guaranteed the direct determination, it is possible that more riders in the territory will align on the GT - Great Bay Race, integrated in the Macao Grand Prix. This is because only 21 pilots scored in these four races, which means that even if all these pilots are signed up for the guide circuit race, seven vacancies will still be filled.
In addition to Kevin Leong, seven other pilots from Macau - Miguel Law, Wong Cheng Tou, Fok Wai Ming, Lao Kim Hou, IP Un Hous, Wong Wai Hong and Law Kit Meng - participated in at least one of the two qualification events and may be repaired for local test if the sports committee's sports committee of the Macau Grand Prix so.
Among the riders are some known names of the region's motorsport, such as Darryl O'Young, double winner of the Macau GT Cup; Chen Weian, 12 -hour separate winner; Liu Kaishun, Chinese F4 runner-up; Daniel Lu, former Champion of the Porsche Carrera Asia Cup; or Luo Kailuo, winner of the GT Cup - Great Bay Race at Macao's 70th Grand Prix.
It's not over yet
This debut season, Sro GT Cup still has two more pointed events, the last, naturally, played in the iconic Guide Circuit. The competition, which has the support of the Macao General Automobile Association - China (AAMC), has reached its intermediate point, and the struggle for the title is in the red. Prior to the mandatory visit to Macau, from 17 to 19 October, the GT4 category cars will compete at the first event held on the streets of Yizhuang, in Beijing.
Beijing's Citadino Circuit is one of the most anticipated auto events in the Popular Republic of China and represents an excellent opportunity for Macao GT4 riders - and not only to prepare for the big challenge that are the curves and countercurns of the territory layout.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:45:06</pubDate></item><item><title>TCR China | André Couto participated in the Zhejiang race</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/tcr-china-andre-couto-participou-na-prova-de-zhejiang/</link><description>Over the weekend, André Couto had an unexpected return to the TCR China Championship, in what was his first race of this season. The rider of the sgas showed that "who knows, never forgets", despite having had a troubled passage through the Zhejiang International Circuit
The Portuguese pilot residing in Macao, who has not competed since November last year-when he played the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals, having won the title in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia Pro-AM category-received a last-minute invitation from MacPro Racing Team to conduct one of the Honda Civic Fl5 TCR Team in the third race of the Chinese Championship. TCR.
Without any previous workout, André Couto came back to sit in a car he already knew, also with a technical structure that was familiar to him. By 2023, the territory pilot had already played some TCR China events with this set, then at the service of the official team Dongfeng Honda Racing Team, showing a progress right from the beginning.
"Free training did not go wrong, but in qualification a less attentive pilot hit me on my first departure lap to the track. He hit me from behind and did not realize why. Damaged me the rear, dislocated the convergence and the car was crooked. Hm. "Still, I qualified myself in fourth in Q1, five tenths of the first, which, with the car in the conditions it was, was not bad. The car had potential."
In Q2, due to the damage, the Japanese car “became much harder to guide” and Couto ended in tenth. However, this ended up having a positive effect: “With the reversal of the starting grid, the tenth place of Q2 allowed me to start first to the second race.”
The first race, played on Saturday on the shaoxing track, did not go as well as the pilot wanted, not being able to follow the official links, nor the best Honda and Hyundai. "I ended up eighth. The car was not as good as I expected and we found that there was a damaged damper, still from the crash in the qualification, which was exchanged for the Sunday race."
Inglorius Sunday
In the 20 Sunday round race, André Couto had everything to shine as he departed from pole-position and Honda finally seemed in a position to fight for the first places. "On the way back, the car was good. I didn't feel strange anymore and I was optimistic."
The idea was to get well to distance themselves from the fastest competitors in the first laps and then manage the race with new tires. However, it all faded quickly when it was wrapped by Wu Yi Fan right in the brake for the first curve.
“That was my mission, but I couldn't,” acknowledged the winner of the 2000 Macao Grand Prix. “He hit me on the first curve and the car was damaged. Sports commissioners, but that does not change the fact that I have given up. ”
With Honda's damaged direction, André Couto had no choice but to leave. "I was a bit disappointed because I hope to get a good result for MacPro Racing Team that had given me a good car.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:26:00</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Jaguar that won in Macau in 1984 returned to the tracks</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/06/gp-jaguar-que-venceu-em-macau-em-1984-regressou-as-pistas/</link><description>The more than seventy years of history of the Macau Grand Prix are people, machines and great moments. We were in 1984, when Tom Walkinshaw won Jaguar's only victory in the guide race. After years away from the audience, for the affected man, this same car returned to the tracks at the hands of an enthusiast of the MSAR MOTOR EVENT
 
Richard Meins, an English maritime transport entrepreneur who lived many years in Hong Kong, who participated on several occasions at the Macao Grand Prix, led this Jaguar XJs of Group A in the Historic Touring Car Challenge race, a competition for classics during the Donington Historic Festival. This “Big Cat”, Chassis No. 5 and one of the four original XJs still existing, is practically as it was in 1984, but given the limitations of tobacco advertising, today boasts the colors used in the European Tourism Championship, instead of the iconic black and gold decoration of John Player Special (JPS) that marked the ticket through the guide circuit.
Interestingly, this return to the clues, from a car that has been still in New Zealand and Japan, was scheduled for the Algarve International Race Track, but the Historic Touring Car Challenge canceled its race in early April in Portimão. So it was in lands of his majesty that Richard Meins made his first race with the British car.
“The car won in Macao in 1984, so I'm a big fan of this model,” Ricard Meins told the English magazine Motorsport News. “I still have the photographs I took this weekend in Macao,” said this avid classic competition car collector who, besides driving, supported several riders at the Macao Grand Prix.
In Donington Park, Richard Meins shared the imposing Jaguar XJS, equipped with a 5.3 -liter V12 engine with Jack Tetley, and ended in sixth place, winning in his class. Richard Meins had only guided the car once or twice, but plans to participate in more historic touring car challenge rounds with XJS 1984. “Let's try to put it on track more often now,” Ricard Meins said, who revealed that he was a stake in the Silverstone Festival in August with this very rare and striking copy of the 1980s tourism cars history.
Premiere of an iconic decoration
In the summer of 1984, Tom Walkinshaw accepted the challenge of the Portuguese organization of the Grand Prix to travel later this year to Macau. With the European title in his pocket, the English driver and team boss was accompanied by one of his usual riders, German Hans Heyer. The guide race was a BMW fiefdom and the controversial English wanted to put an end to the Bavarian domain in the race. To this end, it had the precious support of JPS, which was relaunching the brand, decorating its cars with the famous black and gold colors that would later be eternalized in Ayrton Senna's Lotus. At the time, the guide race took place three weeks before 1000 km from Bathurst, another important race on the worldwide calendar of tourist racing, and so TWR made a "two in one."
The 100 -mile race on the streets of Macao would not have much history, such as the cars built in the Kidlington workshops against the competition headed by the two BMW 635i Schnitzer officers, guided by Hans Stuck and Dieter Quester, and painted by rival Marlboro. Tom Walkinshaw ended first and Hans Heyer and m second.
At the end of the race, quoted by the Portuguese newspaper Autosport, Tom Walkinshaw said: “The circuit is fantastic. Tight, but with many curves, climbs and descents, which made the race become difficult. But I like difficult things and, for me, the race was great from beginning to end.
The Jaguar were again invited by the Macao Grand Prix committee to run in 1985, but Tom Walkinshaw had other plans for his cars. Fortunately, thanks to Richard Meins we will continue to see this beautiful car on the tracks.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Project for new track in Zhuhai emerges</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/automobilismo-surge-projecto-para-nova-pista-em-zhuhai/</link><description>With a very black cloud to turn to the future of the Zhuhai International Circuit, there is a potential good news for the great bay of motoring: a project for a new permanent circuit in the Chinese city adjacent to the MSAR.
According to Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper, Guangdong's provincial government recently published the document “Measures to promote high quality tourism and accelerate the construction of a strong tourist province”, which proposes, for the first time, the creation of an “industrial circle of culture and tourism of the Great Bay”, offering political support to the integrated development of culture and tourism in the region. With this, the first industrial and tourist complex of motorized sports in the Great Bay may emerge.
The project of the Zhuhai Chaoyue international circuit was recently presented at the Zhuhai Ocean Spring Resort, located in Doumen, not far from the city's airport, with an initial investment of 250 million Renminbis.
According to the first information, the project of this circuit provides for welcoming evidence such as Formula 3 and foster collaborative development between motorized sports sectors, cultural events and exhibition industry. The plan includes the holding of several international tests per year and foresees collaboration with Hong Kong and Macau to connect cities such as Jiangmen and Zhongshan, promoting “Multiple stops” and boosting the innovative development of “Event Economics + Cultural Tourism”.
According to Zhou Jian, China Travel Service (Zhuhai) Executive Director General Ocean Spring Resort Co., the FIA grade certification-will also include a karting track, drift track and an interior space of 2,400 m² for exhibitions and events related to the automobile sector. With more than 50 international events projected annually, the goal is to become a "super IP" that joins running, leisure and tourism under the same concept.
The first phase of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit project will include international certification professionals, as well as support facilities. This project aims not only to fill “a gap in the high -end motorized sports sector in Zhuhai, but will also promote the modernization of the Great Bay's cultural, sports and tourist industries by conducting international racing and themed cultural events linked to motorsport.”
Uncertainties in the air
Last summer, the company Malay LBS Bina Group BHD announced that it sold its participation in the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) - the first permanent circuit built in the interior of China - by 124.7 million ringits (about 214.15 million patacas). In a statement to Bursa Malaysia Securities BHD, the group reported that their subsidiary, Dragon Hill Corporation Ltd, sold all his participation in Lamdeal Investments Ltd (Lil) to Huafa Urban Operation (HK) Ltd, a well -known real estate operator. Lil Detinha 60 percent of Zhuhai International Circuit Limited (ZICL), circuit operator.
Raised in 1996 in order to receive the first major award from China from Formula 1 - something that never materialized - ZIC was still the initial motor of motoring in the country and a reference in Asian motorsport. Since its opening, it has welcomed several international evidence, such as the FIA GT, A1 GP or the Intercontinental Le Mans Series. In recent years, track administration has chosen to organize its own events, abdicating the most costly international evidence.
Despite having received, in the past, auto competitions from MSAR, ZIC has been losing protagonism in local motorized sport, due to high prices, limited availability and reducing sports activity in favor of the most profitable commercial activities. The future of the circuit remains uncertain: it is only known that lease agreements between resident teams and the circuit have been frozen and are not being renewed. The track approval will also be about to expire, requiring a new certification to continue to receive competitions in the future.
However, on the weekend of June 14 and 15, the still only circuit of Zhuhai will host the third race of the Formula 4 China Championship season.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 01:53:33</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
