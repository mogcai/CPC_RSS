The 'satellite casinos', under the village of three of the six game dealers to operate in Macau, are managed by other companies, being an inheritance of the Portuguese Administration and already existed before the liberalization of the game in the territory in 2002. When the legislation regulating the casinos was changed in 2022, the end of 2025 was established as a deadline to finish the activity of these gaming spaces.

After all, the lightning rays installed near the ruins of São Paulo may be removed if there are other alternatives, not harming the structure of one of Macao's most iconic monuments.

Despite considering that its installation may harm the visual side of the monument, Leong Wai Man stressed that there is a need to protect it against lightning. Thus, the fact that the lightning rods are reversible makes it a better solution in terms of protection and safety so that in the future they can be removed, decreasing the visual impact on the landscape of the ruins.
Question Si Ka Lon
It is recalled that the idea of ​​placing windshields next to the ruins of São Paulo came last year when a lightning hit the monument, which resulted in the fall of a facade stone, without being resulted in injuries.
However, Deputy Si Ka Lon interpelled the government in July this year about whether this would indeed be the best solution. “Given the frequent occurrence of thunderstorms and the fragility of Macao's historical buildings, the government will proceed to a global assessment of the historical buildings of the Macao World Heritage, proceeding to uniform planning, inspection and maintenance of the system, and to reduce the risks coming from thunders of residents? ”He asked.

Coutinho spoke of no job courses and warned of the situation of many satellite casinos workers who are still unaware of their future
 
Deputy José Pereira Coutinho considers that the great social and political problem of Macau is unemployment, especially the youngest, and that the lack of housing has already moved to the background. "There is no longer the problem of housing, now is the job," he said at the press conference that she took stock of the deputy and her partner, Che Sa Wang, in the last legislature of the Legislative Assembly (AL).
Regarding the closure of the satellite casinos, Coutinho warned that many workers to be placed in the gambling casinos not yet know what they go yet.
"Many workers do not yet know where they will be placed at dealerships. And even being allocated, the situation may not be able to perform the duties in which they have been working for years, having to perform others. This means that in the medium and long term may be pressure situations and, due to age, workers are required to be dismissed, because they are not able to work according to the parameters required by the new employer," he explained.
"I am still concerned because the medium and long term will arise the consequences" of closing, because "either workers are transferred and can handle the message, or otherwise they will simply be required to resign the positions," he said.
Coutinho also highlighted the fact that some positions have lower salaries in the satellite casinos in the face of new positions to occupy in the dealers. "This is a problem we have to see, isn't it? When workers are transferred to perform the same functions at the game tables, will they receive equal footing like colleagues who are already there? We will have to see."
Utility -free courses
With regard to unemployment, Coutinho also warned that many young people unable to find work, or higher education courses that do not guarantee access to employment. "We have received many curricula from young people who can't get their first job. This is serious because companies claim the lack of experience of candidates," said Coutinho.
"Who is Macau to hire a degree in Public Administration? I doubt even the government is. If they are private courses, even worse. There are courses, but there are often not the courses we want. And there is a more serious problem, which is set for example with the university degree who also fail to work," he said, taking into account the ability to absorb the gaming operators and "the disappearance of the satellite casinos in the end of the year, the end of the year. bring a new wave of unemployment. ”
The deputy gave the example of workers in the last edition of the “Zape with Flavors” fair. "Days I was at the fair, on Beijing Street, and there were dozens of young people working there. One will do the boarding school in medicine, and about four graduates in tourism and business management. They were doing Biscates, because they have no work," he exemplified.
However, Coutinho stressed again that one of the reasons for resident unemployment is the fact that “positions are occupied by non -resident workers (TNR)”. The deputy congratulated the government because the “number of authorizations [of TNR] has decreased dramatically”, which means that the executive “is paying attention” to the subject.
A thousand themes in a year
In the legislature now finished, the duo of deputies presented 401 interpeairs to the government, 371 of them written, as well as a total of 107 interpeairs before the agenda, in parliamentary sessions.
Coutinho stated that "the referral of the patients of the Conde de São Januário hospital to the Hospital das Ilhas is important," hoping to grow "gradually, so that people can be healed in a timely manner."
The deputy also spoke of the intervention in cases related to bullying or the difficulties felt by companies in paying the loans granted, because "business is not well because the structure of consumption of Macau inhabitants is modifying."
In the context of civil service, Pereira Coutinho stated that “the issue of stagnation of careers and the problem of appointing management and leadership positions”, without forgetting problems with career mergers, where the names of positions and salaries are different, but the functions are similar. The deputy also calls for “the review of careers in health services”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:14:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Lag | Young people ask for support in employment and education</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/lag-jovens-pedem-apoio-no-emprego-e-educacao/</link><description>Sam Hou Fai gathered with representatives of youth associations, and educational, cultural and sports sectors, to collect opinions for the government lines.

Travis Scott is considered one of the most influential artists of the new generation of American rap taking into account the use of so-called self-tone and use of dense drums, also exploiting the visual language side that your music can present.
The appointment for a Grammy with "Utopia", his fourth studio album, was not, however, the only one. The artist had been named eight times throughout a career that began to form seriously from the first major release in 2013.
First, the “Owl Pharaoh” album project emerged in the market, followed, in 2014, the “Days Before Rodeo”. These two projects would give rise to the studio -produced debut album, simply titled “Rodeo”, released precisely ten years ago. Then Travis Scott began to know some success in terms of sales and recognition of critics.
But the release of “Birds in the Trap Sing Mcknight” in 2016 began to consecrate him as an artist, who for the first time had an album hers to enter the Billboard 200 list.
In addition to his music work, Travis Scott also created Cactus Jack Foundation. It is a non-profit organization that has the mission of supporting young people in the area where it was born, Houston, with toy collection campaigns, scholarship programs for university students and support in the payment of expenses related to education and creative projects.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:27:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Pyongyang criticizes southern leader for speaking of denuclearization</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/pyongyang-critica-lider-do-sul-por-falar-em-desnuclearizacao/</link><description>North Korea yesterday criticized what it described as the hypocrisy of South Korea President Lee Jae-Myung when talking about the possible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang said South Korea is the “only country that has delivered all sovereignty to the United States,” according to an editorial published by the North Korean state news agency KCNA.
The North Korean agency, which transmits Pyongyang's official position on national and international politics, has lamented that Seoul is promoting "empty illusions about denuclearization." He reaffirmed that North Korea will never deliver the nuclear weapons it has.
"Lee must understand that continuing to feed this dream about denuclearization will not help anyone," he said, according to the Spanish news agency Europa Press. North Korea again defended the possession of nuclear weaponry, which considered that the geopolitical situation in the region was inevitable.
"Lee Jae-Myung has never hidden his true reasons: he is a maniac for confrontation," said KCNA. Lee said on Monday during a speech in Washington before President Donald Trump, who intends to work with the United States to "establish peace and achieve the denuclearization of the Korea Peninsula."
A day later, Pyongyang again criticized the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea in the region, ongoing 10 days ago, which described as hostile and demonstrations of the “desire to invade” the North Korean territory.
"Everyone knows that this is not a defensive, especially from a country that has the largest nuclear arsenal," said Kim Yong-Bok, a high official of the North Korean army, in reference to the United States.
Donald, the Peacemaker
At the meeting with Lee, Trump said he liked to meet again with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, with whom he met in 2018 and 2019, and admitted that he could try a summit between the two Koreas. Trump asked Lee to resume dialogue with Pyongyang and opened a "new era of peace in the Korean Peninsula."
Korea, which was colonized by Japan between 1910 and 1945, was divided by the United States and the Soviet Union in two administrative zones, separated by parallel 38, after World War II (1939-1945).
From this division resulted in the Korean War (1950-1953), which opposed the popular Democratic Republic of Korea (North), supported by the Soviet Union and China, and the Republic of Korea (South), supported by an international force led by the United States.
The armed conflict caused about 2.5 million dead, mostly Koreans, and ended with an armistice, but without a peace agreement, so technically Pyongyang and Seoul remain at war. The two Koreas remain divided by parallel 38, and an demilitarized zone near the village of Panmunjom was created, where the Armistício was signed on July 27, 1953.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:39:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Sands China | Reached a bar of 1.1 billion visitors</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/sands-china-atingida-fasquia-de-11-mil-milhoes-de-visitantes/</link><description>Game operator Sands China has reached the bar of 1.1 billion visitors since the game market in Macao in 2004.

There are trips that only poetry allows, inner displacements that cross time and space and illuminate zones of our own memory. When we evoke Qui Yuan (屈原), minister and poet of the former state of Chu, in the fourth century BC, the image that rises before us is that of a lonely man walking by the millet river, declaiming verses impregnated with pain and restlessness, in a succession of steps that would inevitably lead him to the extreme gesture of throwing into waters. The legend went through more than two millennia, but it was the word that guaranteed her immortality, inscribing her voice in the deepest texture of Chinese literature.
The history of Chinese poetry is, to a large extent, the history of its response to the world in crisis. De Que Yuan, who sings exile as an ethical gesture and throws himself into the river, the poets Ming and Qing, who seek reunion with tradition in a ruined landscape, poetry emerges as refuge, resistance and reinvention. This essay runs through this crossing - between dragons and wine jars - to show how literary language remains, even in the darker times, a gesture of rescue of dignity and beauty.
Illustrations of "li sao"
In “lioso” (離騷, encounter with suffering), the experience of exile and political abandonment becomes one of the most intense spiritual trips of world literary history, where the poet's inner topography is confused with the mythical geography of the text. Its lament is not just personal: it echoes the tension between individual ethics and collective decay, the attempt to save a homeland by the purity of language. The poem, long and metamorphic, makes imagination a territory of resistance: Qui yuan wears orchids as if they were armor, reaps sacred plants to read fate, rides dragons and summons fenixes to accompany him. Reading li is means accepting the invitation to inhabit an injunction where myth and memory are mutually reflected, a territory where the intimate and cosmic are confused. The ancient illustrations of “Li Sao Tu” (離騷圖), recorded by Xiao Yuncong at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, extend a well -known crossing of Chinese poetry, between the word and the image. In them, the poet appears immersed in enhanced landscapes, surrounded by rivers, mountains, spirits, dragons and flowers; Each trace of paint seems to respond to the rhythm of the poem's breath, not as a simple visual complement, but as an extension of the poetic experience itself. The engraving gives body to the unspeakable, crystallizing in a visible matter the error of the spirit that the text calls.
Perhaps this is why, more than two thousand years later, Que Yuan's name continues to be summoned every year at the dragon boat festival (Duanwu Jie 端午節). In the rivers of China, thousands of boats cross the waters, the Zòngzi are prepared and shared, the families gather to remember the poet who chose the word before silence. The rite perpetuates memory, the gesture becomes language, and poetry continues to cross time, calling us to a journey where the human recognizes himself in the Universal, where the wound of loss becomes the beauty of permanence.
駕八龍之婉婉兮 ， 載雲旗之委蛇。
忽臨睨夫舊鄉兮 ， 僕夫悲余馬懷。
“I conduct the eight dragons with soft elegance,
The cloud flags wave like dance snakes.
Suddenly glimpse my land in the distance,
And the coachman saddens, and the horse sighs longing. ” (my translation)
This excerpt from the extensive work is a moment of inflection on the visionary route of the poetic self, when, in the course of an ascension guided by celestial forces and wrapped in an intensely mythical imagery, the look turns - suddenly - to the past, or rather, to the land of origin, the lost homeland, which serves as ancholic identity of the lyrical subject. Even within a trip that, so high, threatens to break the ties with the world of men. The opening of the passage - 駕八龍之婉婉兮 - where the conduct of eight dragons with elegant gesture is affirmed, should not only be read as a representation of the poet's physical or spiritual elevation, but rather as the inscription of the subject in a symbolic matrix that refers to shamanic practices of crossing between worlds of Chu and its archaic ritual practices, where the number eight, associated with the Cardeal Directions and Balance Cosmic, and the figure of the dragon, an injunction par excellence, project the poetic self to one other dimension, beyond the empirical reality and subjected to distinct rules and forms of perception of ordinary logic.
By connecting this trip with the next verse-載雲旗之委蛇-where the “cloud flags” move in a serpenty ripple, the text accentuates the ceremonial and almost processional character of crossing, adding a nonlinear movement element, where the fluidity and the absence of directional rigidity suggest that the poet's path is not governed by a closed teleology, but rather by a form of a form of Intuitive displacement, analogous to ritual dance or the internal unfolding of an consciousness in a state of revelation, in which the material elements - the carriage, the dragons, the flags - cease to function as mere instruments and become full symbols, with poetic agency and metaphorical density.
It is precisely within this cosmic choreography, where the movement seems absolute and the detachment of almost consummated matter, which occurs the rupture described by the third verse - 忽臨睨夫舊鄉兮 - in which the verb “look” (睨), modified by the adverb “suddenly” (忽), returns to the poem a dimension of interiority that until then was dissolved in the grandiose environment of crossing. In turning his eyes on the “homeland” (舊鄉), the lyrical subject interrupts, even momentarily, his ascending progression, reintegrating into the visionary space the memory of an origin that is, at the same time, geographical, affective and political. This gesture of return of look should not be interpreted as sentimental nostalgia, but as a statement of the impossibility of a total separation between the poet's spiritual trajectory and the concrete world where his moral integrity has been wounded, being the same world - degraded, corrupt but unreenivial - that structures the central tension of Li.
The fourth and last verse - 僕夫悲余馬懷 - which describes the stall's commotion and the longing of the horse, completes the picture by subscribing to the poet's accompaniment an emotional echo dimension, in which auxiliary figures, traditionally devoid of interior agency, are affected by the melancholy inflection of the main subject, as if their emotion overflowed to the world around the world. This projection of interiority over the elements of the surroundings is not a mere poetic resource of dramatization, but rather a deeply rooted strategy in the cosmological conception underlying Chuci, according to which the individual's emotional microcosm is in permanent correspondence with the order of the universe, and where there is no true separation between subject and environment, between intention and manifestation.
The work li sao is considered so central that, to this day, it is recited at the Dragon Boat Festival (端午節, Duanwu Jie), in memory of the tragic outcome of Qui Yuan's life, whose legendary death is at the origin of the dragon boat festival. The gesture of launching rice balls into the river, according to tradition, will have emerged as a way to feed the poet's spirit - or distract fish so that they would not devour his body.
粽子 (Zòngzi) is a traditional glutinous rice cake, usually wrapped in bamboo leaves, typical of the dragon boat festival (Duanwu Jie 端午节).
Two thousand years later, the tone of Chinese poetry undergoes a deep transformation, although the memory of Quean continues to echo in the subtext of each verse. The crossing of the centuries leads us to the age of Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911), a time when poetry abandons the cosmic and visionary lament of Chu to become increasingly a territory of aesthetic debates and exerts of literary affiliation.
Ming and Qing: poetry as a reflection
If in Que Yuan poetry is a visionary escape before political corruption, in the poets of the Ming era the creative gesture turns in: the crisis is no longer just moral but literary. The challenge now is another - reinventing language without betraying the inheritance.
In li sao, the poet summoned dragons and fenixes to narrate the impossibility of living among corrupt men. However, late China poets were facing another dilemma: how to support a tradition of over a thousand years without sliding for repetition, how to reinvent the poetic voice in a universe already saturated with symbols, shapes and canons? The creative gesture, then, turns inward and poetry becomes aware of itself, crossed by a constant dialogue with the past, as if every new verse was born in the shadow of all who preceded it.
In this scenario emerges the figure of Li Panlong (李攀龙, 1514–1570), whose writing is built between the weight of inheritance and the need for renewal. Known by the name of courtesy (zi) Yulin (于鱗) and the literary name (hào) Cāngming (滄溟), was born in Lìchéng (歷城), in the province of Shandong, and belonged to a group of intellectuals who sought to restore the lost greatness of the Tang.
In the center of Ming Poetry, one of the most intense debates in Chinese literary history gains shape: on the one hand, the “previous seven masters” (Qiney 前七子), a group of poets led by Li Mengyang and He Jingming, who defended a deliberate return to the models of the Tang dynasty; On the other, the “seven later masters” (Hòu qīzi 後七子), represented by Li Panlong and Wang Shizhen, who, although equally devoted to tradition, sought a freer and more creative approach, where imitation was not simple copy but transformation. This confrontation is not limited to rival schools; In it is drawn a larger dilemma, shared by all the poets of the last China: how to write under the shadow of a monumental canon without getting lost in it, how to make a true voice be reborn in a saturated territory of voices.
The previous seven masters saw in Tang poetry, especially in Du Fu's work, the supreme model of formal and moral perfection. They believed that the revitalization of culture went through the return to the “ancient spirit” (Fugu 复古), an attempt to regain the ethical and aesthetic strength that the Tang had crystallized. The word was conceived as inheritance, and the poet, as guardian of this temple. In Li Mengyang's verses, for example, Du Fu's epic ambition reappears, but in a tone already crossed by a loss of loss, as if the evoked greatness was always a little out of reach, dipped in the bruma of collective memory.
The seven later masters, among whom I read Panlong distinguished, did not reject this dialogue with the past, but sought in repetition a creative gesture, such as an old paint layer to discover the hidden shine of the original trait. In his reading, imitating the classics did not mean repeating their form, but prolonging their vital energy. This tension between reverence and invention produces a poetry of great historical consciousness, in which each word seems to weigh with the memory of centuries and, at the same time, to open itself to the possibility of another future.
This aesthetic turn also translates a deeper transformation in the relationship of poetry with the world. If in Que Yuan the poetic gesture coincided with existential gesture-wearing orchids, setting up dragons, facing gods and monsters, until the last response is found in Rio-in poets poetry becomes, for the first time, a self-reflexive act. It is no longer only the mirror of landscape or politics, but a meditation on itself: the poem writes as it thinks the very act of writing, but, when looking back, each poet discovered not only the greatness of the ancients, but also the awareness that language can never return unscathed to the point of origin.
With the dynastic collapse and foreign invasion, the melancholy of Qing poetry is not just aesthetic nostalgia, but a response to historical displacement. Poetic tradition becomes an enneved mirror where one seeks, once again, sense in the midst of the loss.
It is in this space of travel that the Qing poets, heirs and, in a way, critics of the entire Ming project are also inscribed. Under the weight of the dynastic collapse and the Manchu invasion, Qing poetry carries a tone of even more pronounced melancholy, as if the past were an alive landscape seen from afar, untouchable and at the same time essential. The title-enhanced pavilions become a symbol of an aesthetic of the interval: what one sees is always filtered by the distance, the loss and awareness of historical fragility.
黃河水繞漢邊牆 ，
河上秋風雁幾行。
黃塵古渡迷飛輓 ，
白月橫空冷戰場。
“The yellow river serpes through the walls of the Han border,
On the river, fly autonal geese in vain rows.
In the old vau, the golden dust blurred the wagons in the escape / while the moon hangs pale in the cold sky like a battlefield. ”
(my translation)
Here there are no dragons or phoenixes, but dust and cold moon. The epic becomes a historical landscape, as if time had taught the poet to look at not to the heavens, but to the ruins in the ground.
Among his contemporaries was Li Mengyang (李夢陽), one of the famous “seven previous masters” (Qi firezi 前七子), who advocated a deliberate return to classic models, seeing in du Fu an inexhaustible source of inspiration. In his poem “The Look of the Autumn” (秋望), melancholy is projects in the signs of the passage of time and historical decay. They still feel the echoes of the epic grandeur that animated the ancients; However, this resonance is already filtered by a different sensitivity, more aware of the human fragility and the precariousness of the present. Unlike Que Yuan, whose rebellion culminated in absolute dive, Ming and Qing poets seem to write from a more subtle balance between reverence and disenchantment, a place where nostalgia becomes form and poetry itself becomes a dialogue with its own memory:
一瓶一笠一條蓑 ，
善操吳音與楚歌。
野鶴神清因骨老 ，
鴛鴦頭白為情多。
“A jug of wine, a bamboo hat, a straw cover,
I dominate the melodies of Wu and the songs of Chu.
The wild herons keep the spirit clear, for the bones have aged,
The Mandarins ducks clinked together with so much lived love. ”
(my translation)
Here poetry is no longer exile, but everyday pleasure. Qui yuan left for the ends of the world in search of justice, Yuan Hongdao, in turn, finds in the lightness of the instant and in the corner of the birds the poetic truth.
We must not forget Yuan Mei (袁枚) of the eighteenth century, which defended spontaneity and personal sensitivity against excessive formalism. For him, poetry should be born from genuine emotion and not blind obedience to tradition. There are those who see in him a modern, almost romantic spirit, Avant La Lettre.
The contrast of course: qui yuan is poetry as a visionary trip, while ming-qing poets are poetry as a stylistic reflection. One escapes because there is no place for him; The others find a place in their own tradition and play it, reinventing it. Both, deep down, deal with the same restlessness: what to do when the world is not enough?
For Que Yuan, the answer was the mythical flight. For Yuan Hongdao, it was the wine, the singing, the irony. For Li Mengyang, he went to look at the ruins of the war with autumn eyes. Poetry, in all cases, is the space where the human measures over time, whether rising to heaven, or drinking by the Qinhuai River.
Today, as we read these verses, we feel both the dizziness of the sky of Quean and the melancholy of the ming and Qing minged pavilions. As in a world that also feels in crisis - political, climate, existential - we need both answers: the visionary escape that reminds us that we can still dream dragons, and the daily lightness that reminds us that a jar of wine and a song to resist.

The Dragon Boat Festival (端午節, Duanwujie)
Celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, this festival resembles the death of Que Yuan. According to legend, the people of the region launched rice balls (粽子, zongzi) to the river to feed the spirit of the poet or distract the fish from his body. Today, besides the dumplings, the dragon-shaped boat race keeps alive the memory of the exiled poet who has become a cultural hero.
Shenyun (神韻) - the “spiritual resonance”
During the Ming and Qing, critics like Wang Shizhen argued that a good poem must have Shenyun, a difficult immaterial quality: something like the “spiritual breath” or the “atmosphere of the soul” that resonates beyond words. It was not just a technique or style, but a vibration that made the poem transcende. We could call him, in a free translation, the invisible music of poetry.
Gong'an's school (公安派)
Founded by brothers Yuan (Yuan Hongdao, Yuan Zongdao and Yuan Zhongdao), Gong'an's school reacted against classic formalism and defended individual expression, simple language and personal experience as a source of poetry. Yuan Hongdao, with his verses on wine, straw hats and wild birds, is perhaps the best example of this search for authenticity.
The fall moon and the heart of China
In numerous Chinese poems - such as Li Mengyang - The Moon of Autumn emerges as a symbol of melancholy, nostalgia and contemplation. It is not just light, but memory: the fall-filled moon coincides with the middle-oversight festival (中秋節), when separate families look at the same moonlight and feel gathered at a distance. To read these verses is to realize how poetry intertwines with rituals that still survive today.
The longevity of qui yuan
Curiosity: Although Qui Yan lived in the fourth century BC, his fame never diminished. In the twentieth century, the poet was recovered as a nationalist symbol in modern China, and is now celebrated as the first great Chinese poet "of individual consciousness." Your li is, in a sense, one of the oldest autobiographical poems in the world.
Between dragons and wine jars, qui yuan and Ming and Qing poets offer them two faces of the same truth: poetry is refuge and resistance, exile and reunion, visionary escape and serene melancholy. Read today, its strength is not exhausted in historical curiosity: it continues to challenge us, remembering that writing poetry is always to try to transform the world's insufficiency into lasting beauty.

The opening of the passage - 駕八龍之婉婉兮 - where the conduct of eight dragons with elegant gesture is affirmed, should not only be read as a representation of the poet's physical or spiritual elevation, but rather as the inscription of the subject in a symbolic matrix that refers to shamanic practices of crossing between worlds of Chu and its archaic ritual practices, where the number eight, associated with the Cardeal Directions and Balance Cosmic, and the figure of the dragon, an injunction par excellence, project the poetic self to one other dimension, beyond the empirical reality and subjected to distinct rules and forms of perception of ordinary logic.
By connecting this trip with the next verse-載雲旗之委蛇-where the “cloud flags” move in a serpenty ripple, the text accentuates the ceremonial and almost processional character of crossing, adding a nonlinear movement element, where the fluidity and the absence of directional rigidity suggest that the poet's path is not governed by a closed teleology, but rather by a form of a form of Intuitive displacement, analogous to ritual dance or the internal unfolding of an consciousness in a state of revelation, in which the material elements - the carriage, the dragons, the flags - cease to function as mere instruments and become full symbols, with poetic agency and metaphorical density.
It is precisely within this cosmic choreography, where the movement seems absolute and the detachment of almost consummated matter, which occurs the rupture described by the third verse - 忽臨睨夫舊鄉兮 - in which the verb “look” (睨), modified by the adverb “suddenly” (忽), returns to the poem a dimension of interiority that until then was dissolved in the grandiose environment of crossing. In turning his eyes on the “homeland” (舊鄉), the lyrical subject interrupts, even momentarily, his ascending progression, reintegrating into the visionary space the memory of an origin that is, at the same time, geographical, affective and political. This gesture of return of look should not be interpreted as sentimental nostalgia, but as a statement of the impossibility of a total separation between the poet's spiritual trajectory and the concrete world where his moral integrity has been wounded, being the same world - degraded, corrupt but unreenivial - that structures the central tension of Li.
The fourth and last verse - 僕夫悲余馬懷 - which describes the stall's commotion and the longing of the horse, completes the picture by subscribing to the poet's accompaniment an emotional echo dimension, in which auxiliary figures, traditionally devoid of interior agency, are affected by the melancholy inflection of the main subject, as if their emotion overflowed to the world around the world. This projection of interiority over the elements of the surroundings is not a mere poetic resource of dramatization, but rather a deeply rooted strategy in the cosmological conception underlying Chuci, according to which the individual's emotional microcosm is in permanent correspondence with the order of the universe, and where there is no true separation between subject and environment, between intention and manifestation.
The work li sao is considered so central that, to this day, it is recited at the Dragon Boat Festival (端午節, Duanwu Jie), in memory of the tragic outcome of Qui Yuan's life, whose legendary death is at the origin of the dragon boat festival. The gesture of launching rice balls into the river, according to tradition, will have emerged as a way to feed the poet's spirit - or distract fish so that they would not devour his body.
粽子 (Zòngzi) is a traditional glutinous rice cake, usually wrapped in bamboo leaves, typical of the dragon boat festival (Duanwu Jie 端午节).
Two thousand years later, the tone of Chinese poetry undergoes a deep transformation, although the memory of Quean continues to echo in the subtext of each verse. The crossing of the centuries leads us to the age of Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911), a time when poetry abandons the cosmic and visionary lament of Chu to become increasingly a territory of aesthetic debates and exerts of literary affiliation.
Ming and Qing: poetry as a reflection
If in Que Yuan poetry is a visionary escape before political corruption, in the poets of the Ming era the creative gesture turns in: the crisis is no longer just moral but literary. The challenge now is another - reinventing language without betraying the inheritance.
In li sao, the poet summoned dragons and fenixes to narrate the impossibility of living among corrupt men. However, late China poets were facing another dilemma: how to support a tradition of over a thousand years without sliding for repetition, how to reinvent the poetic voice in a universe already saturated with symbols, shapes and canons? The creative gesture, then, turns inward and poetry becomes aware of itself, crossed by a constant dialogue with the past, as if every new verse was born in the shadow of all who preceded it.
In this scenario emerges the figure of Li Panlong (李攀龙, 1514–1570), whose writing is built between the weight of inheritance and the need for renewal. Known by the name of courtesy (zi) Yulin (于鱗) and the literary name (hào) Cāngming (滄溟), was born in Lìchéng (歷城), in the province of Shandong, and belonged to a group of intellectuals who sought to restore the lost greatness of the Tang.
In the center of Ming Poetry, one of the most intense debates in Chinese literary history gains shape: on the one hand, the “previous seven masters” (Qiney 前七子), a group of poets led by Li Mengyang and He Jingming, who defended a deliberate return to the models of the Tang dynasty; On the other, the “seven later masters” (Hòu qīzi 後七子), represented by Li Panlong and Wang Shizhen, who, although equally devoted to tradition, sought a freer and more creative approach, where imitation was not simple copy but transformation. This confrontation is not limited to rival schools; In it is drawn a larger dilemma, shared by all the poets of the last China: how to write under the shadow of a monumental canon without getting lost in it, how to make a true voice be reborn in a saturated territory of voices.
The previous seven masters saw in Tang poetry, especially in Du Fu's work, the supreme model of formal and moral perfection. They believed that the revitalization of culture went through the return to the “ancient spirit” (Fugu 复古), an attempt to recover the ethical and aesthetic strength that the Tang had crystallized. The word was conceived as inheritance, and the poet, as guardian of this temple. In Li Mengyang's verses, for example, Du Fu's epic ambition reappears, but in a tone already crossed by a loss of loss, as if the evoked greatness was always a little out of reach, dipped in the bruma of collective memory.
The seven later masters, among whom I read Panlong distinguished, did not reject this dialogue with the past, but sought in repetition a creative gesture, such as an old paint layer to discover the hidden shine of the original trait. In his reading, imitating the classics did not mean repeating their form, but prolonging their vital energy. This tension between reverence and invention produces a poetry of great historical consciousness, in which each word seems to weigh with the memory of centuries and, at the same time, to open itself to the possibility of another future.
This aesthetic turn also translates a deeper transformation in the relationship of poetry with the world. If in Que Yuan the poetic gesture coincided with existential gesture-wearing orchids, setting up dragons, facing gods and monsters, until the last response is found in Rio-in poets poetry becomes, for the first time, a self-reflexive act. It is no longer only the mirror of landscape or politics, but a meditation on itself: the poem writes as it thinks the very act of writing, but, when looking back, each poet discovered not only the greatness of the ancients, but also the awareness that language can never return unscathed to the point of origin.
With the dynastic collapse and foreign invasion, the melancholy of Qing poetry is not just aesthetic nostalgia, but a response to historical displacement. Poetic tradition becomes an enneved mirror where one seeks, once again, sense in the midst of the loss.
It is in this space of travel that the Qing poets, heirs and, in a way, critics of the entire Ming project are also inscribed. Under the weight of the dynastic collapse and the Manchu invasion, Qing poetry carries a tone of even more pronounced melancholy, as if the past were an alive landscape seen from afar, untouchable and at the same time essential. The title-enhanced pavilions become a symbol of an aesthetic of the interval: what one sees is always filtered by the distance, the loss and awareness of historical fragility.
黃河水繞漢邊牆 ，
河上秋風雁幾行。
黃塵古渡迷飛輓 ，
白月橫空冷戰場。
“The yellow river serpes through the walls of the Han border,
On the river, fly autonal geese in vain rows.
In the old vau, the golden dust blurred the wagons in the escape / while the moon hangs pale in the cold sky like a battlefield. ”
(my translation)
Here there are no dragons or phoenixes, but dust and cold moon. The epic becomes a historical landscape, as if time had taught the poet to look at not to the heavens, but to the ruins in the ground.
Among his contemporaries was Li Mengyang (李夢陽), one of the famous “seven previous masters” (Qi firezi 前七子), who advocated a deliberate return to classic models, seeing in du Fu an inexhaustible source of inspiration. In his poem “The Look of the Autumn” (秋望), melancholy is projects in the signs of the passage of time and historical decay. They still feel the echoes of the epic grandeur that animated the ancients; However, this resonance is already filtered by a different sensitivity, more aware of the human fragility and the precariousness of the present. Unlike Que Yuan, whose rebellion culminated in absolute dive, Ming and Qing poets seem to write from a more subtle balance between reverence and disenchantment, a place where nostalgia becomes form and poetry itself becomes a dialogue with its own memory:
一瓶一笠一條蓑 ，
善操吳音與楚歌。
野鶴神清因骨老 ，
鴛鴦頭白為情多。
“A jug of wine, a bamboo hat, a straw cover,
I dominate the melodies of Wu and the songs of Chu.
The wild herons keep the spirit clear, for the bones have aged,
The Mandarins ducks clinked together with so much lived love. ”
(my translation)
Here poetry is no longer exile, but everyday pleasure. Qui yuan left for the ends of the world in search of justice, Yuan Hongdao, in turn, finds in the lightness of the instant and in the corner of the birds the poetic truth.
We must not forget Yuan Mei (袁枚) of the eighteenth century, which defended spontaneity and personal sensitivity against excessive formalism. For him, poetry should be born from genuine emotion and not blind obedience to tradition. There are those who see in him a modern, almost romantic spirit, Avant La Lettre.
The contrast of course: qui yuan is poetry as a visionary trip, while ming-qing poets are poetry as a stylistic reflection. One escapes because there is no place for him; The others find a place in their own tradition and play it, reinventing it. Both, deep down, deal with the same restlessness: what to do when the world is not enough?
For Que Yuan, the answer was the mythical flight. For Yuan Hongdao, it was the wine, the singing, the irony. For Li Mengyang, he went to look at the ruins of the war with autumn eyes. Poetry, in all cases, is the space where the human measures over time, whether rising to heaven, or drinking by the Qinhuai River.
Today, as we read these verses, we feel both the dizziness of the sky of Quean and the melancholy of the ming and Qing minged pavilions. As in a world that also feels in crisis - political, climate, existential - we need both answers: the visionary escape that reminds us that we can still dream dragons, and the daily lightness that reminds us that a jar of wine and a song to resist.

The Dragon Boat Festival (端午節, Duanwujie)
Celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, this festival resembles the death of Que Yuan. According to legend, the people of the region launched rice balls (粽子, zongzi) to the river to feed the spirit of the poet or distract the fish from his body. Today, besides the dumplings, the dragon-shaped boat race keeps alive the memory of the exiled poet who has become a cultural hero.
Shenyun (神韻) - the “spiritual resonance”
During the Ming and Qing, critics like Wang Shizhen argued that a good poem must have Shenyun, a difficult immaterial quality: something like the “spiritual breath” or the “atmosphere of the soul” that resonates beyond words. It was not just a technique or style, but a vibration that made the poem transcende. We could call him, in a free translation, the invisible music of poetry.
Gong'an's school (公安派)
Founded by brothers Yuan (Yuan Hongdao, Yuan Zongdao and Yuan Zhongdao), Gong'an's school reacted against classic formalism and defended individual expression, simple language and personal experience as a source of poetry. Yuan Hongdao, with his verses on wine, straw hats and wild birds, is perhaps the best example of this search for authenticity.
The fall moon and the heart of China
In numerous Chinese poems - such as Li Mengyang - The Moon of Autumn emerges as a symbol of melancholy, nostalgia and contemplation. It is not just light, but memory: the fall-filled moon coincides with the middle-oversight festival (中秋節), when separate families look at the same moonlight and feel gathered at a distance. To read these verses is to realize how poetry intertwines with rituals that still survive today.
The longevity of qui yuan
Curiosity: Although Qui Yan lived in the fourth century BC, his fame never diminished. In the twentieth century, the poet was recovered as a nationalist symbol in modern China, and is now celebrated as the first great Chinese poet "of individual consciousness." Your li is, in a sense, one of the oldest autobiographical poems in the world.
Between dragons and wine jars, qui yuan and Ming and Qing poets offer them two faces of the same truth: poetry is refuge and resistance, exile and reunion, visionary escape and serene melancholy. Read today, its strength is not exhausted in historical curiosity: it continues to challenge us, remembering that writing poetry is always to try to transform the world's insufficiency into lasting beauty.

This age of opulence, in which the two enjoyed a precious time of luxury, calm and beauty would not be forgotten. The two would be portrayed in a painting of 1732, made by painter Hua Yan (1682-1756), which refers to the splendid place in Luoyang, which would have about 100 concubinas apartments surrounded by a garden, owned by Shi Chong, a scenario that was so well suited to the luxurious meeting, called Jinga Yuan, «Garden of the Golden Valley, and Color, ink and color, ink and color, ink and color, ink and color over paper 178.9 x 94.1 cm, at the Shanghai Museum).

About 1791 had emerged in Beijing a captivating account evoking the happy times of a family of Nanjing. Written by Cao Xueqin (1710-65), who was born there, gave this strong sense of longing. In Shitou Ji, "Stone Reports" better known as Honglou Meng, "The Dream of the Red Room," Cao Xueqin follows the story of young Jia Baoyu, the "Precious Jade", who had been born with a jade stone in his mouth and lived surrounded by a series of female characters that would be taken by painters as models that extended this end of time.
Fei Danxu (1801-50) was one of those authors known by paintings of beautiful young women, inspired by the dream of the red room.

In the Chinese capital 82,000 people had to leave their homes, while in Hong Kong streets and a hospital suffered floods and some subway stations were closed
 
Strong rains continue not to give respite, not only in Macau (see page 7), but in Hong Kong and in the interior of the country. In the case of China, Beijing authorities moved more than 82,000 people from home due to torrential rain, a week after deadly floods that led those responsible for recognizing failures in the response, the official news agency Xinhua said yesterday.
Thus, tens of thousands of residents were removed from the most affected areas by rain until 9 pm on Monday, local time, according to the Municipal Flood Response Center. The center warned of the high risk of floods in the districts of Miyun (northwest), Fangshan (southwest), lied (west) and Huairou (north).
The Chinese capital kept in force the red alert-the highest-until yesterday morning, before predictions of heavy rain between Monday and the morning of Tuesday.
Last week, these same rural districts north of Beijing were the most affected by the weather that caused 44 dead and nine missing, according to official data. Most of the deadly victims were registered in a home of elderly in Miyun.
New measures in agriculture
The severity of the catastrophe led municipal authorities to recognize “gaps” in the preparation of emergency services. Natural disasters are frequent in China during summer, with some regions subject to torrential rainfall and others to severe droughts.
However, the Chinese authorities have reinforced the device to respond to the adverse effects of intense rainfall and heat waves on agricultural crops in various regions of the country, at a crucial time for autumn harvesting.
Since the beginning of the rainy season, east and northern China areas have recorded episodes of extreme precipitation, while provinces such as Henan (Center) and Anhui (East) face prolonged periods of drought and high temperatures.
This combination of meteorological phenomena represents a challenge for farmers, especially when about two months left to harvest the main autumn cereals, the official news agency Xinhua yesterday pointed out.
In the province of Shaanxi (Center), where precipitation recently exceeded 100 millimeters in less than 24 hours, local authorities adopted preventive measures such as channel cleaning and reinforcement of dikes, which allowed to protect most of the cultivated lands.
However, Henan agricultural cooperatives affected by drought opted for gout watering systems and localized application of fertilizers to conserve moisture and minimize losses.
Authorities have given priority to the rehabilitation of water infrastructure and the dissemination of efficient water management techniques in the absence of precipitation in some areas. The autumn campaign represents a fundamental component of China's annual cereal production.
In a statement issued yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs warned that weather conditions in the coming weeks will be determining and appealed to "all efforts to protect the harvest and give strong support to the country's food security."
Chinese President Xi Jinping said in 2023 that, although “1,400 million Chinese eat well” currently, “the food issue should not be careless”, stressing that the supply of food “is not an insignificant issue”.
China has less than nine percent of the planet's aurable land, although it represents about 18 percent of the world's population. In the last summers, weather disasters have caused significant damage in the country: the 2023 scirred months were marked by flooding in Beijing, which caused more than 30 dead, while by 2022 several extreme and dried heat waves hit the center and east of China.
Hong Kong on Alert
With regard to the panorama of heavy rains in neighboring territory, they have not given respite either. According to public broadcaster RTHK, some hong Kong stations were closed yesterday due to the risk of flooding, given that the Hong Kong Observatory kept the black signal of storm [Black Rainestorm Warning Signal] until around 17 hours.
Winds of about 110 kilometers per hour were recorded in some areas of the territory, and thunderstorms were also registered. The rthk channel also reveals that more than 10,800 lightnings were counted in the territory between midnight and 10 am yesterday, half of them occurred on Lantau Island.
Until 11 am yesterday, the authorities responsible for the drainage systems recorded 21 episodes of flooding, and 180 emergency responses were made in 240 different locations.
Highlight for the occurrence of an episode at Queen Mary Hospital this Tuesday, namely “on some roads” hospital access in Pok Fu Lam, and patients were displaced by firefighters to Ruttonjee Hospital in the Wanchai area. In some zones of the hospital the water reached the knees, and sand bags were placed to stop the flow of the rains. At about 11 am yesterday this scenario was resolved, with the normal one returning to the Queen Mary Hospital near noon.
The rains also led to the large increase in water level in the Lower Shing Mun reservoir in the Shaan area, which led to the notification of nearby housing complexes, such as Mei Lam Estate, May Shing Court, Mei Chung Court and Granville Garden.
Despite the heavy rains, some people went to work normally doing alternative routes. This was the case of Mak, a woman who, to the RTHK channel, said she had to make a deviation to get to the office. “I couldn't go straight to there and had to make a longer route. The metro [mtr] made some warnings [about the storm and closures], but I would like them to do them in the carriages as well, because I only realized that access was closed when I got to the exit,” he described.
The sun
Information provided by the Hong Kong Observatory speaks of the passage of an active "southwest monsoon and high altitude disturbances that are bringing heavy rainfall and violent thunderstorms to the southern coast of China and the northern part of the southern China Sea."
Yesterday the highest daily precipitation record was broken to August since 1884, when 355.7 millimeters of precipitation at the Observatory's headquarters were registered.
For today time should stay unstable in Hong Kong, with “heavy rains at the beginning” of the day. However, these "should gradually decrease" tomorrow, expected "a lot of heat with sunny periods in the next two days."
Also the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) leave a heavy rain alert to this day with “frequent, sometimes intense, thunderstorm”. The sun is expected to start appearing at the MSAR from tomorrow, still with some clouds, extending this weather scenario until next Monday. Temperatures should reach 33 degrees.</description><pubDate>2025-08-06 00:29:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Iam | Cats captured due to complaints from the University of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/05/iam-gatos-capturados-devido-a-queixas-da-universidade-de-macau/</link><description>The collection of cats from the land of the University of Macao resulted from “university complaints about the large amount of cats in its campus,” the institute for municipal affairs told HM. The public body removes, for now, the scenario of slaughtering animals, feared by the students
 
The Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) clarifies that the collection of 15 cats between July 22 and 25 of the University of Macao campus (one) emerged in response to complaints from the institution of higher education in relation to hygiene problems in the campus generated by the presence of animals.
"AMI has constantly receiving complaints from one about the large amount of cats on its campus and food waste that is not removed in time and affecting environmental hygiene," was referred to in the response sent to HM.
UM UM Campus Cats led to a wave of students' indignation, who say Temer the slaughter of animals after the period of complaint and adoption. AMI will move away, this scenario.
"Regarding cats captured, if they are not claimed by the owner after the period of complaint, AMI will implement the policy of" open capture, sterilization and adoption "(TNA), prioritizing finding appropriate adopters for cats. It should be noted that AMI does not set a deadline for retention of the adopted animals."
In the same answer it is said that during the waiting period for host families, AMI “will continue to provide clinical care and daily care to animals, never existing their slaughtering situation due to the term of retention period”.
In this sense, it is explained that AMI veterinarians “are performing a series of medical care that include body examination, vaccine administration and microchips.” In addition, “cats can only be available for adoption after being sterilized,” Iam said.
“Lack of sensitivity”
The warnings for the adoption of these animals continue on social networks, and in a note sent to HM and signed by “a member of the UMERS - members of the community of UM”, is questioned the “worrying situation” that occurred during the summer vacation and therefore the absence of most students.

“These cats, considered an integral part of the university community, survived the sign of signal 10, but unfortunately they could not escape these AMI capture operations in recent days. For many students and teachers, these cats were like 'veterans' of campus, following them during significant moments of academic life and providing comfort and joy in the university environment.”
The note explains that "UMERS" members cannot adopt cats "due to various circumstances," such as family allergies, possession of other animals, or "additional restrictions" for students in the interior of China.
The alerts on social networks aim to “sensitize the public for this situation and encourage people with adequate conditions to adopt these cats in the municipal Kennel of Macau.
On the Red Note platform there is even the group “A CatStories”, where the stories of cats captured by AMI are shared, and only one publication generated 460 tastes and 160 comments. A group was also created on Facebook, “Macao Cats II”, and there is also publications on Threads, with a total of 500 tastes and 500 shares, including the ten thousand views.
One of the profiles of the "a catstories" concerns a "slight little cat," described as "a" unnamed "file, just created on the computer: still blank, slowly exploring the world and trying to type loose fragments to write" his own story.
“Hurryned to a corner, I watch the people who pass, evaluating who can become an important character of my plot. So far, few people have been written in my story, and I have also left few brands in someone's life. Before leaving the campus maybe this" unnamed "file is only 5kb, recording some shy explorations and a soft desire for human warmth," reads the adoption.
The HM questioned one on this subject, given that the animals were being cherished by the students, but until the closing of the edition did not receive an answer. "UMERS" members also question how one can one, "an institution that seeks academic excellence and better classifications in the world rankings, demonstrate such a lack of sensitivity, allowing the capture of these animals without any alternative solution."
Aborted association
In the same grade it is said that students considered creating an association to “organize the sterilization of campus cats, but the university did not approve the creation of such a student association”.
UMERS members enhance “contrast with renowned universities in the interior of China, such as the University of Beijing, where there is a student association dedicated to the care of university campus cats, and at the University of Zhejiang, where UM UM Rector Song Yonghua has previously worked an association to protect university campus animals since 2005”.
Regarding animal collection and treatment actions, AMI says that "TNA policies correspond to the guiding principles of the World Animal Health Organization (WOAH), which contribute to reducing the possibility of stray animals being exposed to disease and facing unfavorable environmental factors."
Such policies also contribute to the reduction of the number of animals "and their excessive long -term reproduction." It is also noted that "TNA policies still take into account the state of survival and welfare of animals, in order to find adopting families for animals with conditions, dedicating themselves to helping them to obtain permanent and stable proper care."
The AMI also says it has "constantly optimized the municipal kennels", and in recent years, "complementary facilities and equipment have been perfected." In addition, there is also cooperation “with animal protection associations”, and joint projects in schools and community neighborhoods for animal adoption and care.
Official data available on the AMI website indicates that in the first quarter of this year 264 animals were captured without microchip, which increased to 280 in the second quarter. The numbers are similar to the first two quarters of 2024: the first were caught 266 animals without microchip, followed by 327 animals in the second quarter. In the third and fourth quarters of last year 258 and 203 animals were caught, respectively.
Regarding sterilization actions, in the first quarter of this year 289 were made, followed by 211 actions of this kind in the second quarter. In the first quarter of this year were claimed, or adopted, 102 cats and 29 dogs, and in the following quarter, 93 cats and 49 dogs were adopted.
As for the number of animals slaughtered, in the first quarter of this year alone 32 cats and 69 dogs were killed. If in cats this number reduced in the second quarter to 11, the same did not happen with the dogs: 101 were slaughtered.</description><pubDate>2025-08-05 01:24:52</pubDate></item><item><title>CCCM | Fusion with Foundation for Science and Technology creates new agency</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/cccm-fusao-com-fundacao-para-a-ciencia-e-tecnologia-cria-nova-agencia/</link><description>Operating since 1999, the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center will merge with the Foundation for Science and Technology and the National Innovation Agency, creating a new institution. The practical consequences for the CCCM that aims to promote studies on Macao, China and Asia in Portugal are unknown. The president of the center says it is early to make comments
 
It is not known whether it will maintain its name, the number of scholarships for studies on China, Macao and Asia, or whether to change staff, but what is certain is that the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) will merge with the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) and the National Innovation Agency. Of these three entities will be born the new agency for research and innovation.
The process is linked to the desire to reform the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology by the Portuguese government led by Luís Montenegro, and the changes were announced on Thursday.
However, there is still no great information about the consequences of this merger to the CCCM. At HM, Carmen Amado Mendes, its president, chose to refer to clarification for the future operation of the center, considering that it is "premature" to give answers about something "that is not yet defined."
On Thursday, Minister Fernando Alexandre announced the reform of the Ministry of Education, Science and Innovation with the extinction of several entities, including FCT that has been the main financier of PhD and other research projects in Portugal.
The reform of the ministry was approved by the Council of Ministers and, at a press conference at the end of the meeting, Fernando Alexandre justified the restructuring by describing his ministry as an “anacronic structure”, with fragmented organizations, disintegrated information systems and disarticulated governance.
With 18 entities and 27 higher leaders between the services of the non -higher education system and higher education, science and innovation, the ministry will have only seven entities and 27 higher leaders, with the integration of extinguished entities into new entities.
Regarding the extinction of the FCT, the minister assured that the financing of science will be preserved, with funding for four years that guarantees stability, predictability and “the protection of the financing of the most basic fundamental investigation”.
“When we started thinking about this reform, we do it with a vision: to ensure equal opportunities to access quality education,” said Fernando Alexandre, also underlining the reinforcement of the education system.
Marcelo can veto
The extinction of FCT has generated some less good reactions in Portugal because it fears a reduction in investment in science and research. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, president of the Portuguese Republic, said he had “the sensation” that the foundation was replaced “with an agency in which he was integrated, and had other functions beyond those of FCT.”
Marcelo acknowledged that the Foundation was a “very old structure” and that “it had many aspects that deserved to be rethought”, but said: “Just seeing what the new agency will do can I answer if this extinction is a good or bad idea.”
As for the eventual 'green light' from Belém, Marcelo said that if he thinks this extinction is "good", promulgates the diploma "without anguish." "If you have doubts about a point that is this diploma that is very important I ask the government to rethink. It has happened. I may not veto soon. If the government insists, I can come to veto, if it is until the end of my mandate," he also admitted.
A history of the transition
The CCCM was born in 1995 during the administration of Vasco Rocha Vieira, the last Portuguese governor of Macao, intending to be “a place of excellence for the dissemination of Macau, its history, its culture and its economy”, reads in the memories of Rocha Vieira, “to all the ports I arrived”.
This entity, operating in the Alcântara area, in Lisbon, was inaugurated in November 1999 by the then President of the Republic, Jorge Sampaio, and had as first president Alexandra Costa Gomes.
On the CCCM website it is read that the institution is endowed with administrative autonomy and its own heritage, being a public institute integrated in the indirect administration of the state and under the tutelage of the Ministry of Education, Science and Innovation.
In the objective booklet, it is read that the CCCM “has as its mission to produce, promote and disseminate knowledge about Macao as a platform between Portugal and the Popular Republic of China, as well as between Europe and Asia”, also presenting itself as “a space dedicated to the study and teaching of Chinese language, culture and history”. The center has also been established as "a center for scientific research and continuous and advanced training on the relations between Portugal and China, as well as between Europe and Asia."
After the long presidency of Luís Filipe Barreto, academic at the University of Lisbon, the CCCM began to be chaired, from February 2020, by Carmen Amado Mendes. The leader recently saw her service committee renewed by 2030.
A few months after taking office as president, Carmen Amado Mendes presented, on September 18, 2020, the new “Strategic Development Plan of the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center 2020-2030”.
Since then, the CCCM has awarded dozens of doctoral scholarships for the studies of Macao, China and Asia, and the “Spring Conferences”, which bring together academic performances around the same themes every year. Also noteworthy that the CCCM opened, in December last year, the “Gallery of Governors”, with 41 paintings of the former Portuguese governors of Macao. A new building that houses the file and library was also inaugurated.
This plan sets objectives by 2030, "the reinforcement of scientific and cultural cooperation in the domain of past understanding, present and future trends of relations between Europe and Asia."
Regarding archives, it is intended to “modernize and dynamization within a network of documentation centers and international reference file in Europe-easitic themes, with emphasis on the various files in Lisbon, but also in Portugal and Europe”.
Given that the CCCM houses, in its facilities, the Macao Museum, the board points to the “insertion and appreciation in the museum network at the level of Lisbon and National”.
The central idea of ​​the plan was to develop, by 2030, “CCCM facilities as a pole of streamlining scientific, cultural and economic relations between Portugal and China, including the installation of entities such as the Luso-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Erasmus+Youth Entrepreneurs Association, as well as research nuclei in eurical studies”. It remains to be seen if, with the merger, all these initiatives will continue their initial course.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:39:48</pubDate></item><item><title>USJ | Researchers discover a new species of bacteria in Portugal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/08/usj-investigadores-descobrem-nova-especie-de-bacteria-em-portugal/</link><description>A team of local university researchers identified a new species of bacteria in the Salinas of Rio Maior, Portugal. The type of discovered organism, which lives in extreme environments, widens the limits of biological knowledge and may have implications in areas such as biomedicine, pharmacy or even spatial exploration
 
There is news in the field of microbiology thanks to the latest discovery of a team of researchers linked to the University of São José (USJ), led by André Antunes, interim director of the Institute of Sciences and Environment of the same educational institution.
It is the discovery of a new species of bacteria from 12 samples collected in the Salinas of Rio Maior, in Portugal, which led to the establishment of the new species “Fodinibius alkaliphilus”. The species of bacteria previously known as “Alifodinibius salipaludis” for “Fodinibius salipaludis” was also reclassified.
The conclusions appear in the article “Fodinibius alkaliphilus sp. Nov., Moderately halophilic and alkaliphilic bacterium isolated from an Inland Saltern in central and reclassification of aliifodinibius salipaludi as fodinibius salipalis sp. SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY. The scientific journal is a publication “reference for new macrobial data”, being the official publication of the International Procaryotes Systematic Committee and the Applied Bacteriology and Microbiology Division of the International Union of Microbiological Societies, describes a USJ note.
In addition to André Antunes, the authors team includes researchers from the University of Science and Technology of Macau, coordinated by Marta Filipa Simões; Researchers at the University of Minho and Seville University.
According to the same USJ note, "the new [bacteria] species grows better in salinities about four times higher than those of seawater and also prefers alkaline conditions, combining the ability to grow in different extreme environmental conditions."
The importance of this type of studies, including analyzes to “such extreme environments”, is “future applications in a wide range of fields, including biomedical and pharmaceutical, but also extends to the discovery of new useful materials and the provision of useful information for future space exploration”.
The same team of investigators is not stopped, as "other samples of these places are currently being investigated and new publications describing other new species are expected in the coming months."
“This publication highlights the strengths of Macau in the articulation with partners of Portuguese and Spanish -speaking countries, as well as its growing importance in the fields of biodiversity and biotechnology,” is still described.
The Power of Salinas
The researchers explain that "the species Aliifodinibius Salipaludis has been described, but their name has not yet been validly published." In field work the team isolated these species from “hypersaline environments, including saline, salt mines and saline soils”.
Prior to the fieldwork itself, the team conducted “an investigation to the microbial diversity of hypersaline environments in downtown Portugal”, and samples were collected in the Rio Maior area in July 2019. There were 12 genera bacteria from the Rio Maior salines.
Located in the central area of ​​Portugal, in these Salinas there is the “brine, which is about seven times more salty than seawater”, being “pumping from a well and generated by the crossing of a local underground course with an extensive salt deposit”.
The article also gives a historical context of this location. "Although they were first referred to in twelfth-century documents, these places are believed to have been linked to salt extraction from prehistoric times. They offer a single scenario, as they are the only interior saline in Portugal and the only ones in full functioning throughout Europe."
Thus, the study in question “was part of a bioprospecting campaign centered on this place”, resulting in “the isolation of a bacterial strain (N2T) and the discovery of a new putative species within the genus Fodinibius”.
In this work is determined “the taxonomic position of this new isolated based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonos and molecular properties”, is described.
Importance for Science
At HM, André Antunes explained that this discovery is, first of all, interesting to the scientific community, by bringing “additional information” and constituting a discovery “about the biodiversity that exists on our planet, more concretely at the macrobial level”.
"So far, we have been able [general scientific community] to study less than 1 percent of all microbes species on the planet. In over 99 percent we have no idea what they are, what they do and what their abilities, or what impact on the environment and our lives," he explained.
The researcher also said that "the microbes that come from extreme environments, and above all from environments with a lot of salt, which is the case of this species we now discover, are very interesting for a large range of biotechnology applications."
"We can include things like the medical area, biomedicine, the production of new pharmaceutical compounds or the production of new biomaterials, such as bioplastics," said André Antunes. The academic even talks about applications in “more exotic areas, which are now beginning to have a little more visibility, such as the potential application in construction, the production of more sustainable cements or concrete structures that have the self -repair capacity”.
This discovery also has some impact "for space exploration, more specifically to better understand what the limits of life are and where to seek life outside our planet." It is also included "very important implications for missions that are exploring Mars, namely as to the type of environments where it may be feasible to find past signs of life or present or other parts of the solar system."
A job that continues
The investigation is not for the Salinas of Rio Maior, and the team led by André Antunes last year, an expedition to Antarctica. “There are antarctic samples that we are currently studying and we have samples taken from the red sea bottom, where salt concentration is also quite high.” Therefore, the saga of discovering new bacteria and potential reclassifications in those that already exist.
André Antunes says that the discovery of a new species of microbes "is quite important to science, not only for the perspective of science at the basic level, but because we can have a better perspective of diversity we have on the planet."
“As we study extreme environments we can have additional information about what the limits of life are and how life adapts to extreme conditions.” Thus, André Antunes advocates investment in science so that there is later “an associated practical component, so it is not always easy to convince the financing entities”, as to this point.
The researcher also points out that the article and the investigation fits “very well in the priorities of Macau and the USJ itself, with regard to the focus in the area of ​​environment, biodiversity and biotechnology, anchored in connection with Lusophony”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-08 00:04:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Australia | Great Coral Barrier has been declining since there is a record</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/07/australia-grande-barreira-de-coral-sofre-maior-declinio-desde-que-ha-registo/</link><description>The Great Barrier of Choir, with 2,300 kilometers long, off the Australian East, has been suffering the largest coral decline since registrations began in 1986, a yesterday report published.
The Australian Institute of Marine Sciences, of the government, documented the condition of 124 reefs between August 2024 and May 2025 to determine the widespread coral lanchament in the three sections of the Greater Barrier.
The impact is higher in the northern areas (Cape York to Cooktown), with a 24.8 percent decline compared to the 2024, and southern levels (proserpine to gladstone), with 30.6 percent, representing these two values ​​“the largest annual decline in coral cover” in 39 years.
In the central region (cooktown to proserpine), the decline recorded is 13.9 percent compared to last year. The last episode of bleaching on site, declared UNESCO's World Heritage Site, has a "high to extreme" prevalence in all three areas, scientists find in the report.
“Individual reefs registered a decline of corals of up to 70.8 percent” near Lizard Island in the North Zone, it refers to the study. The death of the corals, manifested by its bleaching, is caused by the impact of water heating - temperatures were recorded one to 2.5 degrees Celsius above average during the southern summer of 2025 - associated with the climate crisis.
The large coral barrier “experienced unprecedented levels of thermal stress, resulting in the most extensive and severe bleaching that there is registration to date”, read in the document, in reference to the phenomenon that occurred in 2024 and continued during the first months of this year.
The Australian agency warns that the habitat can reach “a point of non -return”, where the choir cannot recover sufficiently quickly between catastrophic events.</description><pubDate>2025-08-07 00:22:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Economic Report Highlights Startup “Historical Record”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/06/hong-kong-relatorio-economico-destaca-recorde-historico-de-startups/</link><description>"Hong Kong's startups are on the rise." This is how the executive in the neighboring region describes the business environment in the region, where they were created in 2024 about 4,700 startups, plus 10 percent of 2023. In the "Report of Hong Kong's Business Environment 2025" it is read that the territory is far from losing economic competitiveness
 
The Hong Kong government released last July 30 the latest report on the neighboring region's economic scene. And one of the highlights is given to the scenario of growth of entrepreneurship.
In the “Report of Hong Kong’s Business Environment 2025” [Hong Kong 2025 Business Environment Report] it is noteworthy that “Startups in Hong Kong are on the rise”, given that last year there were “about 4,700 startups in the city, a historic record and an increase of 10 percent from the previous year”.
The document explains that "more than a quarter of these startups has founders from outside Hong Kong," it is companies that operate in a "broad spectrum of sectors, including Fintech [High Technology], Electronic Trade and Information, Informatics and Technology", having hired more than 17,000 people. This number of human resources also represents an increase of seven percent compared to 2023. "All this is proof of Hong Kong's strong appeal for startup entrepreneurs," the authorities highlight.
But it is not only startups that record growth, with the report to point out that the current government, led by executive head John Lee, "achieved remarkable results in attracting companies, investments and talents."
"For example, in 2024, the number of companies in Hong Kong with headquarters outside the territory increased significantly by about 10 percent, reaching almost 10,000." The “Office for the attraction of strategic companies, created more than two years ago, attracted 84 strategic companies to establish or expand their business in Hong Kong, including companies with market capitalization or valuation of over $ 10 billion, involving cutting -edge technology”, it is added.
The report also points out that between January 2023 and the first half of this year, Invest Hong Kong, linked to the Raehk government's direct foreign investment department, "helped over 1300 foreign and continent companies establishing or expanding their business in Hong Kong, bringing investments of over $ 160 billion."
Still with regard to Invest Hong Kong, the entity helped "539 companies from the continent or foreign to establish or expand their business in Hong Kong, which represents an annual growth of over 40 percent."
At the end of June this year, Hong Kong had 1.5 million local businesses, while the total number of companies not registered in Hong Kong reached 15 509. "Both figures represent historical records," it reads, and for the government of the neighboring territory the data "demonstrate the great confidence that companies in the continent and abroad have in the future of Hong Kong."
Given that Hong Kong also has a talent capture program, the Hong Kong Talent Engage, reads in the report that by June this year "were received about 500,000 candidates in the shelter of various talent admission programs, of which about 330,000 were approved." Of these numbers, Hong Kong actually arrived to work 220,000 qualified frames.
Good scholarship scenario
Quoted on an official press release, a government spokesman stated that "in a complex and volatile external environment, Hong Kong is undergoing a phase of economic update and transformation, but there are more opportunities than challenges."
Given that the territory has always positioned itself as a strong financial market worldwide, this scenario seems to have recorded a recovery in recent years.
“This year Hong Kong's financial market performance has been constantly improving. The Hang SENG Index has a 18 percent increase last year and an increase of more than 25 percent this year so far. The average daily business volume in the first half of the year was about $ 240 billion, with an increase of about 120 percent.”
Authorities highlight the maintenance of the economic competitiveness of the territory, pointing out that "over the years Hong Kong has been constantly classified as a global leader in economic freedom and competitiveness."
Attention to the trade war
In conclusion, Raehk's government clarifies that territory seems to maintain economic stability in times of constant commercial conflicts, with Donald Trump threatening and imposing tariffs on a number of countries.
“As volatile and turbulent as the world may be, we remain firmly committed to the rules -based multilateral commercial system, with the WTO [World Trade Organization] as a nucleus, while actively participating and supporting regional economic cooperation.”
The “numerous advantages of Hong Kong” are referred to, with its “highly internationalized business environment, a flexible and solid financial system, a simple and secure tax regime with low tax rates and a robust and independent legal system”.
However, in the document it is also stressed that the “tariff war caused a global reallocation of capital”, and Hong Kong wants to bet on the attraction of “foreign companies and capital” to the region.
The report also tells that "international organizations and foreign trade chambers in Hong Kong are confident in the future perspectives" of the territory, and that for the authorities "there is no reason to worry about some excessively pessimistic feelings."
"In fact, the Raehk government is creating a new momentum and expanding the ability to support Hong Kong's economic growth, thus increasing its overall competitiveness and achieving high quality development," is still added.
The executive spokesman also established a parallelism between good economic situation and political stability. "In recent years, the implementation of the National Security Law has restored a stable social environment in Hong Kong. This not only protected the rights and freedoms of the general public, but also made Hong Kong a safe haven to attract international capital and investment," he concluded. The report was presented by the secretary for Hong Kong finances, Paul Chan.</description><pubDate>2025-08-06 23:29:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Portuguese knight bets on the formation of competition horses in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/cavaleiro-portugues-aposta-na-formacao-de-cavalos-de-competicao-na-china/</link><description>Report by João Pimenta, Agência Lusa
Step, trot and gallop: On a farm outside Beijing, Portuguese João Ruas training six horses daily to the practice of Dressage, an equestrian Olympic discipline that seeks to expose the maximum of the animal's athletic capabilities.
“It's a very very relationship,” he described to Lusa the Knight, a native of Lisbon. "There are days when we are almost like a father to teach the son, others where it is the horse that teaches us to us. But there must always be mutual respect," he said.
Streets, 28, arrived in China a year ago to raise six horses and form Dressage on a farm in Shunyi, the district in northeastern Beijing where the villages and agricultural fields resemble the interior of China than the capital of 22 million.
Ten kilometers from the Huairou reservoir, a 12 -kilometer artificial lake that supplies Beijing and regulates the flow of local rivers, the fifth is surrounded by watercourses, tree -lined slopes, corn fields and natural reserves.
On the horizon, the mountainous chains that rise to the north of the Changing and Huairou districts complete a landscape that contrasts with the tangle of glazed torres and apartments blocks of Beijing's urban network. “When I'm here I don't remember if I'm in China, Portugal or Germany,” explained João Ruas. "I'm in a bubble, let's say, and it's a good bubble."
Without previous experience in the country, the Portuguese was surprised by the sympathy of the Chinese and the reception of the local community. On the day he was interviewed by the Lusa agency, his cargo tricycle advocated on his way to the supermarket. Depressing the neighbors quickly sent to try to fix the vehicle.
“I am the only foreigner here. I communicate for gestures, I am still learning Chinese, but I have always been very well treated. The neighbors help in everything,” he said.
Despite the enthusiasm with life in the countryside, the coach admits difficulties in the exercise of the sport he has been practicing since he was nine years old. "There is a lot of amateurism, little technique, expensive and poorly frequency evidence. And everything that involves horses here is frankly more expensive than in Europe."
The horse “is not dominated by force: it requires patience, knowledge and sensitivity,” he said. "It's like an athlete. There are good days and bad days. And don't talk. We have to know how to read the signs. A small reaction may indicate a serious problem," he noted.
In Portugal, João Ruas studied at the D. Dinis Agricultural Professional School, where he reconciled classes for last weekends with the coach. Since then, it never left the horses. "I started with once a week, then two, then three, until I got to five. I had to insist a lot with my parents to start," he said.
In China, he works with European horses, brought on purpose to compete in Dressage evidence. The goal is to prepare animals since the age of three for competitions that normally start at four. "There is still a tradition of creation with sports focus. Horses have been raised for many years, but not with selective criterion for sport," he said.
Shanghai, the country's economic “capital”, leads the practice of drassage in the country, with more proof and better infrastructure. In Beijing, there is a growing interest, but there is still a long way to go. “It can be good to start like this, almost from scratch. It allows you to do things well. Without addictions,” reflected streets.
With the arrival of another horse soon and the prospect of continuing work in China, João Ruas is said. "I see myself here for many more years. It only costs the distance. But with today's technology, we managed to shorten it," he said. "There are sacrifices that are good for the soul."</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:54:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Unemployment | COUTINHO warns for pressing problem</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/desemprego-coutinho-alerta-para-problema-premente/</link><description>At the balance sheet of the last legislature of the Legislative Assembly, deputies José Pereira Coutinho and Che Sai warned to the growing problem of unemployment in opposition to the lack of housing. Coutinho spoke of no job courses and warned of the situation of many satellite casinos workers who are still unaware of their future
 
Deputy José Pereira Coutinho considers that the great social and political problem of Macau is unemployment, especially the youngest, and that the lack of housing has already moved to the background. "There is no longer the problem of housing, now is the job," he said at the press conference that she took stock of the deputy and her partner, Che Sa Wang, in the last legislature of the Legislative Assembly (AL).
Regarding the closure of the satellite casinos, Coutinho warned that many workers to be placed in the gambling casinos not yet know what they go yet.
"Many workers do not yet know where they will be placed at dealerships. And even being allocated, the situation may not be able to perform the duties in which they have been working for years, having to perform others. This means that in the medium and long term may be pressure situations and, due to age, workers are required to be dismissed, because they are not able to work according to the parameters required by the new employer," he explained.
"I am still concerned because the medium and long term will arise the consequences" of closing, because "either workers are transferred and can handle the message, or otherwise they will simply be required to resign the positions," he said.
Coutinho also highlighted the fact that some positions have lower salaries in the satellite casinos in the face of new positions to occupy in the dealers. "This is a problem we have to see, isn't it? When workers are transferred to perform the same functions at the game tables, will they receive equal footing like colleagues who are already there? We will have to see."
Utility -free courses
With regard to unemployment, Coutinho also warned that many young people unable to find work, or higher education courses that do not guarantee access to employment. "We have received many curricula from young people who can't get their first job. This is serious because companies claim the lack of experience of candidates," said Coutinho.
"Who is Macau to hire a degree in Public Administration? I doubt even the government is. If they are private courses, even worse. There are courses, but there are often not the courses we want. And there is a more serious problem, which is set for example with the university degree who also fail to work," he said, taking into account the ability to absorb the gaming operators and "the disappearance of the satellite casinos in the end of the year, the end of the year. bring a new wave of unemployment. ”
The deputy gave the example of workers in the last edition of the “Zape with Flavors” fair. "Days I was at the fair, on Beijing Street, and there were dozens of young people working there. One will do the boarding school in medicine, and about four graduates in tourism and business management. They were doing Biscates, because they have no work," he exemplified.
However, Coutinho stressed again that one of the reasons for resident unemployment is the fact that “positions are occupied by non -resident workers (TNR)”. The deputy congratulated the government because the “number of authorizations [of TNR] has decreased dramatically”, which means that the executive “is paying attention” to the subject.
A thousand themes in a year
In the legislature now finished, the duo of deputies presented 401 interpeairs to the government, 371 of them written, as well as a total of 107 interpeairs before the agenda, in parliamentary sessions.
Coutinho stated that "the referral of the patients of the Conde de São Januário hospital to the Hospital das Ilhas is important," hoping to grow "gradually, so that people can be healed in a timely manner."
The deputy also spoke of the intervention in cases related to bullying or the difficulties felt by companies in paying the loans granted, because "business is not well because the structure of consumption of Macau inhabitants is modifying."
In the context of civil service, Pereira Coutinho stated that “the issue of stagnation of careers and the problem of appointing direction and leadership positions”, without forgetting the problems with career mergers, where the names of positions and salaries are different, but the functions are similar. The deputy also calls for “the review of careers in health services”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:14:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Huawei | Today open candidates for the formation of young people</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/huawei-abrem-hoje-candidaturas-a-formacao-de-jovens/</link><description>Today he opened the period of candidacies to Huawei's basic formation of qualified staff in the digital area, intended for “young people from Macau without any digital knowledge”. According to a statement released yesterday by the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL), the plan will last only four weeks, providing 30 vacancies to the restricted group of young people without digital knowledge.
The government states that the plan aims to help young people “develop a digital mindset, grasp the opportunities created by digital transformation, and allow them to become qualified interdisciplinary cadres”. The objective is to increase the dynamics in the valorization and regaining of industries and the development of the diversification of the economy.
The training will start on October 9 and ends on November 7th and is intended for holders of the resident identity ticket of Macao and the Salvo Conduct to travel to China, under 35 years. In addition, they should be at least licensed from Macao or abroad higher education institutions.
During the formation, each forming will receive 5,000 patacas for subsistence subsidy and 5,000 more PATACA for transport and insurance. The training will take place in Hengqin, with a trip to Huawei headquarters in Dongguan.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:11:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Nam Kwong | Fuel distribution deposit to operate</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/nam-kwong-deposito-de-distribuicao-de-combustiveis-a-operar/</link><description>The Macao fuel distribution deposit, located at the entrance of the artificial island of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, was officially delivered yesterday to Nam Kwong oil to start operations that represent “a new stage in standardization and safety of the storage and fuel management system,” says a joint statement of security forces and firefighters.

Suggestions are aligned with executive policies, including integration between teaching and industry and deepening patriotic education
 
The chief executive met on Wednesday afternoon with representatives of 12 youth associations and Macao's educational, cultural and sports sectors to hence the opinions and suggestions for the upcoming lines of government action.
Generally speaking, according to the Social Communication Office (GCS), the suggestions presented are aligned with the government's priorities. Thus, the integration between industry and education, promotion of scientific and technological education was requested and the formation of qualified staff in these areas, deepening patriotic education.
Other objectives were also mentioned by the government's policy list, such as the response to low birth, facilitation for Macau residents to live and work in Hengqin, the reinforcement of the development of sports and cultural industries, the construction of the “city of the show” and the “city of sports”.
The GCS states that some members of the associations have requested the “continuous bet” in the educational industry that the government puts “the works of young people as a priority” to create “more job opportunities and entrepreneurship through the implementation of various measures”. These measures that were not specified. Some of these "opinions" were delivered in writing even before the meeting with Sam Hou Fai.
Hengqin test
In turn, "the Chief Executive stated that the government attributes great importance to the work of Macao youth, striving to create better conditions for their growth and development."
Sam Hou Fai argued that the construction of the International University Campus in Hengqin, a project nominated by Beijing, "demonstrates the significant importance that the Government of MSAR dedicates to young people and local students."
The ruler also promised to “strengthen the power of the city in the field of culture and sport” and “will invest strong support for the development of qualified paintings in the scope of the arts and elite athletes”.
In addition to Sam Hou Fai, the meeting was attended by the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, and the Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam Vai Man, the Director of Regional Policy and Development Study Services, Cheong Chok Man.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:09:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Hengqin | Appointed new leaders after corruption case</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/27/hengqin-nomeados-novos-dirigentes-apos-caso-de-corrupcao/</link><description>The Macao government yesterday announced the appointment of five leaders for the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin, three months after China announced a case of corruption linked to the development of Mountain Island. Neither the Government of the MSAR, nor the commissioner against corruption, wanted to comment on the case
 
According to an order from the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, published in the Official Bulletin, among the new appointments is NG In Cheong, which will be the new subdirector of the Executive Committee of the Deepened Cooperation Zone between Guangdong and Macau, which is part of the special area of ​​Hengqin (Mountain Island). NG was so far head of the Department of Affairs of International Law and Interregional Law, under the protection of the Directorate of Justice Services.
The manager will replace Su Kun, who resigned on May 15 “for personal reasons”, according to a statement, released by the Macao authorities, which contained only one sentence. SU was one of the six deputy coordinators of the executive committee of the in-depth cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macao.
According to the Macao Government portal, this commission “assumes the functions of promoting international dissemination, business and investment capture, industry introduction, land exploitation, construction of specific projects and management of subjects concerning the life of the population”.
Also on May 15, the secretary's office for the economy and finance, Anton Tai Kin IP, said Su Kun still resigned as the secretary's advisor, a request that was approved.
Deafening silence
Su Kun's resignation came a day after the Guangdong Province Anti -Corruption Commission announced the beginning of an investigation to the former president of the state company responsible for the development of the Hengqin Special Zone.
In a statement, Guangdong's Provincial Disciplinary Inspection Commission reveals that former Hengqin Zhuhai Group President Hu Jia, “is suspected of serious disciplinary violations,” a phrase that usually refers to corruption cases.
The note, also with only one sentence, says Hu is being the subject of “disciplinary review and investigation” by the Municipal Commission for Inspection and Disciplinary Supervision of Zhuhai, a city to which Hengqin belongs.
Asked by Lusa about whether Su Kun's resignation is related to corruption investigation against Hu Jia, Secretary Anton Tai's office refused further clarification. Lusa also asked the commission against corruption if she had received a complaint or if she was investigating any case involving su kun, but the agency said she had no comment.
The Hengqin Zhuhai Group was created in 2009 by the municipality of Zhuhai for the construction and development of the special hengqin economic zone.</description><pubDate>2025-08-27 23:47:25</pubDate></item><item><title>CCAC | ID again hiring a company that failed in the management of pools</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/27/ccac-id-volta-a-contratar-empresa-que-falhou-na-gestao-de-piscinas/</link><description>The Institute of Sport (ID) again awarded contracts in the area of ​​public swimming pool management to the company that had previously caused problems, and this after promoting a new public tender due to these occurrences. The case was reported yesterday by the Commissioner Against Corruption (CCAC) and reported by the Chinese channel of Radio Macau.
According to the CCAC, ID “launched a new public tender due to the incapacity of the award to comply with the swimmer's swimming pool and service management contract”, and “the same company was soon able to obtain contracts of the same type.” CCAC understands that "this practice is unacceptable and difficult to understand, affecting the impartiality and credibility of adjudication."
At issue, there are two contracts earned by the company in March last year, and in the contractual period it could not hire "a sufficient number of salvator swimmers, which led to the cancellation of adjudication." However, in August of that same year, the ID made changes and launched four new competitions for the same services, considering that “the company was not prevented from participating, applying the same evaluation criteria”, so this entity earned the award again.
The ID says it has “agreed with the recommendations”, stating that “it will improve public tender procedures”, which implies cutting companies qualifications into the list of criteria for the evaluation of proposals, analyzing the historical of the adjudicators in the last 24 months. Companies can thus be penalized in case of failures, has been reported.</description><pubDate>2025-08-27 23:45:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Ponte Macao requires the concession of land in the PAC on</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/27/ponte-macau-obriga-a-rever-concessao-de-terreno-no-pac-on/</link><description>The government has revised the grant, by lease, of a land concessioned since the 1990s to the Limited San Fung Hong Real Estate Investment Company, which is located next to the Pac On Aterro in Taipa. The terrain in question has a building built, in numbers 114 to 130 of WO Mok Street, and the change was due to the work of the fourth crossing between the Macao peninsula and the mud, the Macau bridge.
Initially, this concession was assigned to build a brick factory there, “to explore directly by the concessionaire”, but then “the concession was revised due to the change of purpose to install a tobacco factory, to explore directly by the concessionaire in the building built on the ground”, reads in the order published yesterday in an official bulletin.
From March 3, 1998, and due to “Vicissitudes Miscellaneous”, the government was authorized by the “temporary use of the land, as an exceptional way, to install a storage complex of goods and correlative services by the limited Sino-Macau Centro Centro de Limited Centro Society”.
Since the company “intends to maintain the logistics storage activity that has been developed in the building built on the ground, on March 22, 2021, the request for change in the purpose of the land and the consequent revision of the concession contract” has been formalized.
Fewer meters
However, with the Macau Bridge construction project, the company gave up the granting of two plots of the land, and the due counterparts were calculated due to the dimension changes of the land. Thus, a terrain that initially had 9,450 square meters of area, was 8,157 square meters concession. On June 12, the Land Commission gave a favorable opinion to the request for a concession review. Johnson Choi Chun Sze is referred to as the legal representative of the Limited Real Estate Investment Company.
In the new concession the industrial purpose is maintained, the land is intended to “keep the building built in it affection for the purpose of warehouse”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-27 23:45:08</pubDate></item><item><title>SME survival</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/sobrevivencia-das-pme/</link><description>Confronted with the challenges placed by online purchasing platforms and the current trend of Macao residents to fuel themselves in the cities of the Guangdong region, as well as changing the purchasing standard of mainland China tourists, small and medium -sized (SME) in residential areas are increasingly difficult to survive. With the end of the satellite casinos, the stores installed around them are also facing great challenges.
In response to the closing of many more stores, the Government of RAEM recently launched initiatives such as “Zape with Flavors” and the “Great Award for Consumption in Community Zones”. Zape with flavors ended last Sunday (August 24), but how effective was it? I bet only traders from community zones where Zape took place are in a position to respond.
According to the Forbes report in 2025, Macau is the third region of the world with the highest per capita GDP, reaching the $ 134,040 and the first in Asia. Data from the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services indicate that in the second quarter of 2025, the average monthly income of residents employed was 20,000 patacas and the average salary of full-time resident workers (who worked 35 or more hours a week) was in 21,000 patacas, being equivalent to that of the first quarter of this year. Based on these numbers, the purchasing power of Macau residents must be very strong, all businesses and trades should be flourishing and everyone should enjoy a feeling of wealth and happiness. So why didn't you stop the closing wave of commercial stores? Why does there be news of suicide cases?
According to the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL), which cites the data released by the Public Security Police, there were 183,568 workers not residing in Macao in late April this year. In addition, last June, Dsal declared that in February there were 183,222 non -resident workers in Macao, in response to certain written interperations presented by deputies in the Legislative Assembly. Most of these workers are linked to the construction sector and cross the macau-zhuhai land border in the morning and late afternoon. The disparity between the labor market and the consumer market creates difficulties in the survival of SMEs, especially for those located around the North Zone of Macao. Recently, another Chinese restaurant in the North Zone announced the closing after the closure of the Wong Kam restaurant.
Due to changes in the consumption pattern of tourists visiting Macao and the imbalance of the city's economic structure could short -term community activities or even the “large award for consumption in community zones” that lasts 13 weeks to be a factor of change for small and medium merchants?
As an organism at the service of citizens, the Government of the MSAR must devote itself entirely to public well-being. Under the beginning of “a country, two systems”, and in the capitalist context of the free market, who has the most resources or has more power has the greatest profit opportunities. The government is simultaneously the manager and the social resources distributor.
It is the government's responsibility to effectively use the resources at their disposal to take care of each citizen. A reasonable redistribution of goods is the key to reducing the pit between the rich and the poor. Without a doubt, RAE's current government is perfectly aware of Macao's present economic and financial situation. The relaunch of the “great award for consumption in community zones” and increased subsidies for disabled and elderly demonstrates that he knows the difficulties of those who are at the bottom of the social hierarchy. However, the current relief measures are unfortunately short-lived and are not well defined, and they lack specificity and long-term planning.
Macao's SME salvation is not something that can be achieved in the laboratory. The governmental actions of the economy and finance area contained in the next report of the Government Year of Action for the Financial Year of 2026 will be a crucial test to the capabilities of the Government of the MSAR.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:41:47</pubDate></item><item><title>The American Pope (IV)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/28/o-papa-americano-iv/</link><description>“Let us disarm Words and we will go to disarm the world.”
Leo XIV
On board a nave that traces sometimes dissonant trajectories regarding Trump's impulses. Not to mention Musk, free electron after the presidential separation of the president. Little is understood of this rising vacancy ignoring that it owes its ascension to the collapse of globalist liberalism, at its height in the last decade of the twentieth century. Bill's 1992 presidential boss of Bill Clinton stated “It's the Economy, Stupid!”, And followed by his supporters that for the mid-bass American became synonymous with deprivation, depression and identity crisis. Populism is the son of elitism. Reinforced by the arrogant liberal failure. The tricky reaction, which seeks to radiate beyond the acting president's season, should be taken seriously. Vance and Trump seem to share the anti -liberal crusade that aims to connect to the American Revolution states, parties, and ideologically close to the Maga Movement.
Themselves, along with medium and heavy weights from the Trumpist Circuit, intervene shamelessly in the elections of “friends and allied” countries. The list is extensive. The most recent case is that of Poland, where the head of internal security, Kristi Noem, successfully endeavored to support the rise of national conservative Karol Nawrocki to the Presidency of the Republic, in confrontation with Prime Minister Donald Tusk, alleged Vassalo de Brussels. Already in February, Vance had harshly criticized the Euro Atlantic leaders at the Munich Conference and supported the alternative to Germany (AFD) against moderate, Europeist and late globalist, accused of repressing free debate and threatening democracy in the Federal Republic. Similar campaigns occurred in the United Kingdom in support of the resurgence of Farage in France by Marine Le Pen, disqualified by a controversial sentence in Romania by defeated presidential candidate George Simion, self -declared adherent to the “Maga Ticket” in Ireland by Conor McGregor.
Even in South Korea by Yoon Suk Yeol, which according to Trump was removed from the presidency by a coup orchestrated by China. Not to mention the cordial hug with Giorgia Meloni, encouraging and at the same time embarrassing for those who offer themselves as a bridge between Europeans and Americans. The internationalized and non-globalized magician intends to be the protector of Western civilization, flourished in Europe from the Hellenic and Roman Judeo-Christian seed, revisited and transmitted to the New World by the English, reaching its maximum splendor in the United States. Today threatened by the global finance, the politically correct and the “ethnic replacement” generated by the catastrophic crossing between non -assimilable immigration and the decline of birth. In defense of the “traditional values”, starting with the family.
Western civilization is the concept that there is a natural order of things and that we have rights that derive from God. And that there are rules, Terry Schilling, founder of the project for American principles. The best definition of the international Maga is given to us by a young state department advisor Samuel Samson. For those who are urgent a new alliance of civilizations with Europe, against the Liberal Global Project that prevents the flowering of democracy, that the moment along with the inheritance of the West, in the name of a decaying ruling class that fears their own people. Therefore, this partnership should be based on the American common heritage, not in globalist conformism. We watched the sketch of one to laiche ecclesiastical doctrine. Politics and geopolitics. New/old religion with stars and tracks. The originality of this cult lies in the appropriation of Catholicism, shaped to its own needs.
Faith that attracts one in five Americans. After years of decline, Latin Christianity seems to be recovering. Above all converts. In this antipapista nation, with former Evangélicas or Atheists Vance has traveled both steps to light that look at Rome and are enthusiastic about the "pontiff, means that the wind is changing. The Vatican is exposed to the double risk of being used by a dubious canon fidelity faction for power and/or confronting the geopolitical and economic actor “number one” at incalculable costs. Including for your own finances. USAID's dissolution has already affected Catholic orders and movements around the world, usual beneficiaries of the border that guarantees trust in God. Worse, Catholic recovery in unfaithful territories, even fishing among Christians of other confessions, can culminate in conflict between progressive and traditionalist believers.
The American Pope's nightmare is having to resolve internal disputes in his home church. While Trump via Vance or vice versa, thickens his divisions with the Pope's local departments. What fundamentals? From Catholicism, Vance is attracted to the dogmatic certainties, traditional liturgies, longing for the common good. Crowned by the Pope's authority. All to provide mobilizing morals the awakening of the national community, objective of the ongoing revolution. Against progressivism, liberalism, socialism and associated sins. If it were pontiff, Vance would return to Vatican I, expanding the sphere of papal infallibility. Their referents are Augustine of Hippona and Thomas Aquinas, which offers original reading excerpts. From “aquinate” it extracts an adapted interpretation from the Ordo Amoris. Challenge to the heart of your declared religion. Love is Christianity. In Christ it is free. Vance offers a paid version.
In favor of your political and geopolitical current account. It says love, but understands ethical norm. With which it declines the sociogeopolitical hierarchy of love. Vance's scale has five degrees that are the family, neighborhood, community, homeland and rest of the world. Classification of the duties of the good American, against the rhetoric of rights. Unconsciously with the good Samaritan. Unmirminated in Jesus' agapic impulse, hug open to all. Perhaps closer to the veterotamentary tradition that privileges Jewish love by Jews. Chance, or God, wanted Vance to occupy the last days of Francis. First forcing him to refutation for his order of love, which he publicly adhered to Cardinal Prevost. Then, leading him to receive his nécsis, a few hours before he died, not to cross glances that said more than any word. Augustine, the African, reports in the confessions that, young and skeptical teacher of rhetoric, in 384 arrives in Milan to find Bishop Ambrose, animator of the persecuted Christian community.
With astonishment, he finds him silently walking the Scriptures: “When I read, the gaze was running through the page, and the intellect persisted the meaning; voice and tongue remained at rest. We were often closed in a long silence and who would dare to disturb such recollection? And we always see him read in this silent way, never otherwise »(Confessions, 6,3). At the time, and for centuries, the few literate, especially in shared environments, read aloud. An act of generosity towards the often illiterate neighbor. Today, a library is distinguished by the sound of silence. At that time, voices crossed. Communicated reading, that is, transmitted in community, was a rule and would remain until the beginning of the second millennium. Silent or murmured reading excludes others. Hence the discomfort of St. Augustine. This patristic figure, man to Benedict XVI, who in his heart solidifying with the noise of silence is brought by psychoanalyst Luigi Zoja as an example of the drift who drives us away from others to close ourselves. Speak little.
The verb has moved from the (virtual) speaking (virtual), replaced by technology. With its devoted ego devices, the English “i”: iPhone, iBook, iPod, iPad. Egoïste is the perfume that Chanel promotes as the olfactory portrait of a fascinating and unattainable man. Do we watch the collapse of the "us," the death of others, a consequence of God's death? The Christian is allowed to think so by deducting the Gospel of Mark (12: 28-31), which attributes to Jesus the brief summary of the commandments, that is, of love; First, “The Lord our God is the only Lord. Love the Lord your God with all your heart »; Second, "love your neighbor as thyself." Two loves chained by paradox and intention. But where is the next today? The distance between humans, social animals by constitution, grows. To such an extent that compromises the very meaning of societies, especially but not only western. An unnatural condition. An antisocial Darwinism that fragments communities. Program word that unites cum and munus, "together" and "task." Of shared tasks there is little memory.
You can write right by crooked lines. But without God (in the proper sense of Nietzsche), without near (in the unlimited opening of Jesus) and without common projects, ordering chaos is utopia. This is the double crisis of meaning of the Church and America, which triggers an identity and geopolitical competition within and between atomization collectivities. The reason for living is at stake. Win, or at least not get lost, the pastor who best regroups his scattered sheep. This is about this that the dispute is about the order of love. Church and America opposite the challenge of decline. In his synodal emphasis, Leo XIV associates Holy Ignatius of Antioch, led in chains to martyrdom as “then I will be truly disciple of Jesus Christ, when the world does not come to my body” (Letter to the Romans, IV, 1). He referred to being devoured by the beasts in the circus and thus happened, but his words evoke, in a more general sense, an unenforceable commitment to those who exercise a ministry of authority in the church how to disappear so that Christ remains small for him to be known and glorified (John 3,30). After Leo Magno, lion the little one?
The introvert and split church do not serve large popes, which in the best of the case cover their illness. It is necessary to rediscover the meaning of communion, today at risk. In his high idea of ​​himself, Trump becomes omnipresent and omnifalante. Incense as a mega president to make America big again. Neotraditionalist Catholics who applaud him do not worry about being less than they seem. But those who, fierce in their sterile progressivism, ridicule Vance's doctrinal insipience and associates, glorify itself and bet that the tricky counter-revolution is a deplorable parenthesis, ending out of play. In the church, in America, throughout the West even at rival powers, deprivation of contact with others is unbearable to existence. No matter whether by right or duty, the human being will always seek the neighbor, will suffer if he does not find him. We shared Zoja's conclusion, so that together we seek an answer that anywhere, at any time, has the distance always an obstacle to love, why should our different be? Can you really love or just know what is far away? And only knowledge allows to at least be fair? Nothing demonstrates it.</description><pubDate>2025-08-28 00:02:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Keeping in mind the story and building a promising future</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/27/tendo-em-mente-a-historia-e-construindo-juntos-um-futuro-promissor/</link><description>By Liu Xianfa*
This year is the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese people's resistance war against Japanese aggression and world antifascist war. The War of Resistance of the Chinese people against Japanese aggression and the anti -fascist war are decisive battles between good and evil, light and darkness, and the progressive and the reactionary. From 1931 to 1945, the Chinese people, having fought for 14 years, won the great victory of their resistance war against Japanese aggression and the complete victory of the anti -fascist World War with all people lovers of the world. This year also marks the 80th anniversary of Taiwan's recovery of the Japanese occupation. Taiwan's recovery to China is a victorious result of World War II, an integral part of the International Post-Warning Order, and a great victory of all the Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan, through their successive efforts and bloody battles.
The fundamental role of the Communist Party of China is the key to victory in the Chinese people's resistance war against Japanese aggression
Throughout the course of the war, the Communist Party of China has always been at the front line and assumed its responsibilities, exercising strong political leadership and boosting the formation of a historical current of resistance from the whole nation. China is the main eastern battlefield in the world anti -fascist war. The Chinese people's resistance war against Japanese aggression was an important part of the anti -fascist World War and contributed decisively to the victory of the world antifascist war. In this devastating war, the War of Resistance of the Chinese people against Japanese aggression began earlier, lasted longer, defeated the largest number of enemies and made the greatest sacrifice. In 1931, the Japanese imperialists blatantly launched an attack on the city of Shenyang staged by the Japanese Kwantung army, known by the September 18 incident, which is 8 years before the Nazi Germany Blitzkrieg in Poland and 10 years before the attack on Pearl Harbor. By then, Chinese soldiers and civilians had already fired the first shot in the anti -fascist war and tirelessly fought in the cold plains of northeast China. During the blacks of the resistance war, China immobilized almost 70% of the Japanese army and thus helped allied forces in other theaters to obtain vital strategic opportunities. During their 14 years of war, the Chinese people made huge national sacrifices and paid a high price. According to incomplete statistics, the number of victims of the Chinese military and civilians exceeded 35 million, representing approximately one third of the total victims during World War II. Direct economic loss was over US $ 100 billion, and the indirect economic loss of more than $ 500 billion.
Macao is never absent from this war and fights side by side with his homeland all the time
All sectors of Macao society spared no effort and have surpassed all the difficulties in providing help, such as accommodation, food and medical care, to a large number of war -moved compatriots. Patriotic figures of Macao, such as Mr. Ma Man-Kei, Mr. Ho Yin and Dr. Ke Lin, broke the heavy blocks from the Japanese invaders and sent groceries and backgrounds to the front line. A legion of Macau's passionate young people left without hesitation for the Batalha fronts at the River of Pérolas, Dongjiang and other zones. Patriotic groups raised huge sums of money to support soldiers on the front line and made great efforts to promote resistance war advertising. The Yellow River Cantata, composed by the musician of the people of origin of Macau, Mr. Xian Xinghai, sounded the roar of national danger and became the strongest voice of national salvation. History will never forget the indelible contributions made by Macao to national independence and the liberation of the Chinese people, nor will it forget the deep feeling of patriotism and national rectitude of compatriots in Macao.
Adopt a correct historical perspective, which is peaceful, just, comprehensive and objective, about the history of World War II
The story cannot be tampered with and the facts should not be deleted. Even today, moved by geopolitical interests, there are some countries and politicians who are still trying to ignore historical facts, intentionally minimizing China's important contributions to World War II as the main eastern battlefield, embellishing colonial rule and even directly denying the history of fascist aggression and brutal crimes committed by the Japanese army. Such negligible and shameful acts represent challenges to the United Nations Charter, the International Postwar Order, the human consciousness, and the peoples of all victorious nations. The 1.4 billion Chinese will never tolerate any attempt to manipulate the history of World War II. China, along with peace -loving peoples around the world, will fight to the end against all unlawful acts that distort, glorify or deny the history of aggression and together will safeguard historical truth and defend world peace.
Unite to build a community with a future shared for humanity
The United Nations International System as its nucleus is a concentrated reflection of the victory of World War II, and serves as a basic stone for the international postwar order. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China is always an indispensable and important force in maintaining world peace. China will never follow the old path of some countries that have achieved modernization through war, colonization and looting. Instead, China will remain firmly on the right side of history and the progress of human civilization, and will keep the flag of peace, development, cooperation, and mutually beneficial. China's proposals to build a community with a shared future for humanity and other important concepts and initiatives are a continuation and development of the valuable experience of victory in World War II and contributed to wisdom and Chinese solutions to the promotion of human peace and development. China will work unshably with the international community to practice the vision of global governance of broad consultation and joint contribution to shared benefit, implement global security initiative, global development initiative and global civilization initiative, and build a community with a shared future for humanity.
As President Xi Jinping pointed out, "war is like a mirror, looking at him helps us to better appreciate the value of peace." We must learn from history, especially from the harsh lessons of World War II, extract wisdom and strength of the great victory of anti -fascist World War and strengthen our determination to safeguard peace and consolidate security to jointly build a brighter future for humanity. We believe that all sectors in Macau will firmly take the noble patriotic tradition and the great spirit of the resistance war, thus contributing to the constant and comprehensive development of the principle of “a country, two systems”, to the realization of the complete reunification of the homeland and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation!
*Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Popular Republic of China in the Special Administrative Region of Macau</description><pubDate>2025-08-27 01:55:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Robotic rental belly (i)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/26/barriga-de-aluguer-robotica-i/</link><description>This year was held in the mainstanding robotic Games World, with the presentation of Badminton competitions, basketball and speed events played between robots. These innovative technological achievements were surprisingly overshadowed by another news: the robotic rental belly.
In August, several media announced the news that researchers from a reputed university institution in Singapore, in collaboration with other institutions, were working on the first robot that could function as a rental belly: the "robot mother." If successful, the mother robot may give birth to a baby.
The mother robot measures 1.65 m and has the appearance of a woman. Innovation implies the implant at the location corresponding to the uterus of a fertilization system based on bio-engineering and artificial intelligence. Subsequently, sperm and eggs will be inoculated, fertilization occurs and the mother robot can “give birth” a baby.
Information made available online indicates that the mother robot can cost about 100,000 rmbs. Sequoia Capital and the Tencent Conglomerate have already invested 230 million RMBs in the project. The mother robot is expected to be released this year.
The mother robot will have a human uterus. Since much research on artificial uteros have been developing in a hospital in Philadelphia, USA. The system, called “Extend”, consists of a biological bag that contains a sterilized fluid and can lodge an embryo and tubes that provide you with nutrients and oxygen. In 2017, the hospital experienced the embryo of a sheep, in a state of development equivalent to a human embryo from 23 to 24 weeks, and the lamb was born after four weeks in the hospital.
In 2021, the First Affiliatred Hospital at the University of Zhengzhou, China, made a successful experience successfully, also through the implant of sheep embryos in artificial uteros.
On September 19, 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration held an independent consulting meeting to discuss the eventual approval of the first worldwide clinic designed to test “artificial uteros” technology for human beings pregnancy.
For an artificial uterus to work, it must maintain a constant temperature, provide oxygen and nutrients, eliminate feces and prevent infections. With current technologies, it is possible to maintain a constant temperature, but other requirements have to be perfected gradually. Therefore, the launch of the mother's robot market next year will depend on the technological advances that can be obtained to maximize the five functions of the human womb.
More insightful people have realized that when research for the mother robot starts, they will imply significant social changes and controversy. If a human being is born of a mother robot, the first question will be who will pay “the expenses of delivery?” And how much will these expenses be assembled ”?
The first answer is easy, it will naturally be the child's parents. The main reason that will lead them to this method will be any health problem that prevents the mother from getting pregnant and, after medical counseling, uses the help of the mother robot. If the embryo that grows inside the mother robot is the result of insemination of the biological mother's egg by the sperm of the father, there will probably not have great controversy.
But if this embryo is not originated by the couple's genetic material? What happens next? For example, if a couple donate sperm and eggs and then man dies in an accident and later the woman gets married with another man, can the new husband inherit the status and parental rights of the biological father?
An even more complex scenario involves a single father or single mother, two men, or two women who will have to use eggs or sperm from a third person to give rise to the embryo that will grow in the "belly" of the mother robot and then have to be adopted.
In either case, the law is fundamental. Must regulate the following:
1. Is the use of the mother robot cool?
2. If it's cool, can we use the mother robot?
3. How is a mothers robot company to operate.
Next week, we will approach these three questions in detail.

According to a note from the IC, the installation "The Tower of Time" aims to celebrate the "cultural bond between cities of East Asia" and was prepared by "three consecrated artists from China, Japan and South Korea."
These are “reference figures in Asian contemporary art”, being Guan Huaibin, “famous Chinese contemporary artist and specialist in artistic facilities and spatial multimedia art”. Hirotoshi Sakaguchi, “famous Japanese artist and honorary professor at Tokyo University of Art”, also made his contribution. In the case of this artist, he has already carried out “works that cover various means, including painting and landscape art”.
In this installation, the South Korean contemporary artist Kim Sang-Youon also collaborated, "whose creation is deeply influenced by eastern philosophy and focuses on issues related to the coexistence between man and nature."
“Lighthouse of the soul”
"The Tower of Time" combines, according to the IC, "eastern philosophy over time and space with the language of contemporary art, surpassing the limitations of physical space." Thus, a "lighthouse of the soul" is built that "incorporates both historical depth and future tensions."
“Through poetic form in the flow of light and shadow, the work stimulates the sensory interaction between the public and the installation, to jointly build individual and collective memories, inspires the meaning of life and eternity, becoming an artistic framework that inscribes the cultural friendship between the cities of eastern Asia,” also describes IC.
This installation is part of the “Public Art Exhibition” Biennial section, subject to the theme “Waves and Paths”. Within this section of the Biennial has been developed another project since July, entitled “Community Co-Creation and Mutual Help by San Mei On”, led by Australian artist Jason Ho. It is a project that mixes workshop, mixed technique and community art.
The presentations of artist Zhang Xiao, who will develop his artistic activities in the same community between this Saturday and 5th September.

This tour is born from the release in 2023 from the album “Utopia”, considered the best-selling hip-hop album this year, having been in the first place in the Billboard Top 200 for four consecutive weeks. In addition, when it comes to streaming platforms used to listen to music, Utopia recorded over 50 billion streams worldwide, and the Spotify platform considered Scott's album the most heard in the first week of 2023. Also Apple Music confirmed that this album hit records like more heard on the 2023 release day.
Success since 2013
"Utopia" features tracks such as "Thank God", "Hyaena", "Modern Jam", "My Eyes" or "God's Country", having Travis Scott received a nomination for a Grammy, considered the most important prizes in the music industry.
Within the hip-hop universe Travis Scott is a name to retain. Born in the Houston area by the name of Jacques Berman Webster II, the rapper adopted this stage name and began exploring trap style changes with a much more melodic and experimental approach. In this way, the artist, who is also a music producer, has managed to fuse several sounds such as rap, hip-hop or R&amp;B.
Travis Scott is considered one of the most influential artists of the new generation of American rap taking into account the use of so-called self-tone and use of dense drums, also exploring the visual language side that your music can present.
The appointment for a Grammy with "Utopia", his fourth studio album, was not, however, the only one. The artist had been named eight times throughout a career that began to form seriously from the first major release in 2013.
First, the “Owl Pharaoh” album project emerged in the market, followed, in 2014, the “Days Before Rodeo”. These two projects would give rise to the studio -produced debut album, simply titled “Rodeo”, released precisely ten years ago. Then Travis Scott began to know some success in terms of sales and recognition of critics.
But the release of “Birds in the Trap Sing Mcknight” in 2016 began to consecrate him as an artist, who for the first time had an album hers to enter the Billboard 200 list.
In addition to his music work, Travis Scott also created Cactus Jack Foundation. It is a non-profit organization that has the mission of supporting young people in the area where it was born, Houston, with toy collection campaigns, scholarship programs for university students and support in the payment of expenses related to education and creative projects.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:27:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Creative Macau celebrates 22nd anniversary with new exhibition</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/27/creative-macau-celebra-22-o-aniversario-com-nova-exposicao/</link><description>It is now inaugurated in the Creative Macau gallery a new show that aims to celebrate the entity's 22nd anniversary, and simply calls itself “22”. In the show, which is evident until September 27 this year, are revealed works by local artists or names linked to previous projects of Creative Macau, such as Alice Costa (Lili), Angel Chan, Coco Cheong Ut Man, Cristina Lu, David Chio, Denis Murrell, Elisa Vilaça, Gigi Lee, Irene Chio, Joan Lam, Justin Chiang, Justin Ung, Ken C.I. Chau, Law Sao I, Leong Leng, Li Li, Liesl Lee, Lúcia Lemos, M.Chow, Maria João das, Mavin Zin, Ng Cheok Ieng and Yaya goes.
In this collective exposure, a reference to the philosophical concept of tautology is made, which corresponds to a language addiction that leads to unnecessary repetition of unintentional terms and expressions. Thus, the works exposed at Creative Macau contain various forms of expression of the “everyday language” when “unintentional tautologies” are used.
In this case, where the use of tautology in the field of arts is used, this becomes “an expressive and inspiring technique”, where “the possibilities” of this repetition of language are explored to realize whether “it is a limitation or liberation”, or “a meaningless repetition or a self-affirmation with hidden meanings”.
According to a note by Creative Macau, this exhibition “brings together artists who used various means to present 'tautology', challenging the novelty of language and image, and inspiring multiple perspectives”. It is intended, with the exposed works, to “find depth within repetition” and provoke a “rethink of the essence of 'meaning'”, leading the audience to discover themselves in “simplicity”.
Philosophical concept
In tautology there are repeated utterances, the same concepts said differently and with different words. There is, in logic, the symbol “⊤” as a representation “of a true proposition that only depends on internal coherence and is independent of external conditions”. It seems, at the outset, that these repeated statements are empty, but in fact "contain a 'variant in repetition'." Basically, these works of art intend to respond to the idea or possibility of “meaning to be transformed into different contexts”.
According to the organizers of “22”, “the repeated presentation of elements in art challenges our expectations of 'meaning', leading us to question whether understanding is always built from repeated symbols and languages”. "Perhaps, only through repetition, we can see subtle differences," is mentioned.</description><pubDate>2025-08-27 23:55:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Lecture | Xu Bing, Chinese contemporary artist, stars in conference</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/27/palestra-xu-bing-artista-contemporaneo-chines-protagoniza-conferencia/</link><description>The Cultural Institute will hold, next month, a lecture in which the main figure is the Chinese artist of contemporary art Xu Bing.

There were 30 “important” works of the artist, namely “Book of Heaven” and “Book of Earth”.

Long career
Xu Bing was born in Chongqing, China, in 1955, but grew up in Beijing. His connection to the arts began in 1977, when he entered the department of engraving of Beijing Central Academy of Fine Arts, having completed his studies in 1981. Then he taught in this department.

In a statement sent to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the company revealed a loss of $ 182 million from Hong Kong during the first half of this year, 12.3 percent than in the same period as 2024.
Between January and March, the group founded by the late game tycoon Stanley Ho Hung Sun had recorded a $ 31 million profit from Hong Kong. The SJM ended 2024 with a $ three million profit from Hong Kong after unprecedented losses for four consecutive years.
The operator's casinos raised $ 14.8 billion from Hong Kong in the first half of 2025, 7.5 percent than in the same period last year. Non -game revenues, on the other hand, rose 11.9 percent to more than 1 billion dollars from Hong Kong.
Despite the increase in revenues, the company's operating profit dropped 5.1 percent to Hong Kong's $ 1.65 billion. SJM's debt increased in the second quarter, reaching Hong Kong's $ 27.3 billion at the end of June, 2 more percent than at the end of March.
Mass distribution
In June, the Fitch Ratings Financial Notation Agency maintained the SJM debt rating, although the concessionaire decided to end, until December 31, the exploitation of seven 'satellite casinos'.
The 'satellite casinos', under the village of three of the six game dealers to operate in Macau, are managed by other companies, being an inheritance of the Portuguese Administration and already existed before the liberalization of the game in the territory in 2002. When the legislation regulating the casinos was changed in 2022, the end of 2025 was established as a deadline to finish the activity of these gaming spaces.
SJM has decided to try to acquire ownership of hotels where two 'satellite casinos'-bridge 16 and Casino Royal Arc are located-and ask the authorities to take direct management of the spaces. The pasta market, whose revenues rose 7.1 percent, represented 83 percent of the recipes of all SJM casinos, while VIP game recipes decreased 6.6 percent in the first half.
The big bets, which in 2019 represented 46.2 percent of the game industry revenues in Macau, were affected by the arrest of the leader of the world's largest VIP betting company in November 2021.
The former Suncity Executive Director, Alvin Chau Cheok Wa, was sentenced in January 2023 to 18 years in prison.
Also yesterday, SJM said it will pay $ 529 million from Hong Kong (the Mother's Mother Company, the Macao Tourism and Amusement Society, to acquire part of the Lisbon Hotel and thus expand the existing casino on the property.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:44:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Hengqin | Firefighters save two lost residents on the mountain</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/hengqin-bombeiros-salvam-dois-residentes-perdidos-na-montanha/</link><description>Two residents of Macao who were taking a night walk on the Naobeishan mountain in Hengqin lost and were rescued by the Zhuhai firefighters on Sunday night.

The company's results, which explores the Kam Pek Casino in downtown Macao, were announced in a note sent to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

The results of this Paradise Entertainment activity segment were justified by increasing revenues in sales and rental of electronic equipment, with particular emphasis on increasing demand and popularity of multi-game terminals that allow bets on various types of play, following in direct tables with croupiers and meat players and bone.
These terminals allow multiple smaller value bets compared to real tables, adding game options to the mass segment.
Despite the closure of the casino satellite, which operates under the SJM license, Paradise Entertainment said that industry development, moving away from the VIP segment, “is in close consonance” with its strategic objectives. In addition, the group has indicated that it will expand electronic game system services and equipment to Asian markets such as Philippines and Sri Lanka, as well as to northern America.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:23:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Employment | More than 130 places for cleaning and restoration</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/emprego-mais-de-130-vagas-para-limpezas-e-restauracao/</link><description>Enrollment opened today for three employment fairs, organized by the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) and the Macao Workers' Associations Federation (Faom), which will offer 133 job opportunities.

The statements were made on the sidelines of a meeting of the Cultural Heritage Council
 
After all, the lightning rays installed near the ruins of São Paulo may be removed if there are other alternatives, not harming the structure of one of Macao's most iconic monuments. This confirmation arose from the president of the Cultural Institute (IC), Leong Wai Man, who on the fringes of a meeting of the Cultural Heritage Council explained to journalists that the lightning rods are reversible.
According to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, the official explained that its installation took place in a commitment solution after the IC requested an opinion from the Chinese Academy of Cultural Heritage, subordinate entity of the National Administration of Cultural Heritage.
Leong Wai Man stated that questions such as the best method of installing the lightning rods were considered in order not to harm the landscape provided by the ruins. Despite considering that its installation may harm the visual side of the monument, Leong Wai Man stressed that there is a need to protect it against lightning. Thus, the fact that the lightning rods are reversible makes it a better solution in terms of protection and safety so that in the future they can be removed, decreasing the visual impact on the landscape of the ruins.
Question Si Ka Lon
It is recalled that the idea of ​​placing windshields next to the ruins of São Paulo came last year when a lightning hit the monument, which resulted in the fall of a facade stone, without being resulted in injuries.
However, Deputy Si Ka Lon interpelled the government in July this year about whether this would indeed be the best solution. “Given the frequent occurrence of thunderstorms and the fragility of Macao's historical buildings, the government will proceed to a global assessment of the historical buildings of the Macao World Heritage, proceeding to uniform planning, inspection and maintenance of the system, and to reduce the risks coming from thunderstorms and ensure the safety of constructions and the safety of constructions and the safety of constructions and the safety of constructions and constructions and the safety of constructions and the safety of constructions and the safety of constructions and constructions and the safety of constructions and the safety of constructions and constructions and the safety of constructions and the safety and the safety of constructions and the safety of constructions and the safety and the safety of constructions and the safety and the safety of constructions and and the safety of constructions and the safety of constructions of residents? ”He asked.
Si Ka Lon also highlighted the fact that the current technical regulation against fire and enclosure safety and enclosures, responsible for regulating the installation of lightning equipment, having some imperfections, asking the executive to “take as reference the interior practices of China in order to define more rigorous criteria for the update and maintenance of lightning protection facilities”.
In response to the deputy, the direction of soil services and urban construction ensured that the lightning lightning was being installed “given the height, outside design, construction materials, environmental conditions surrounding and the height of the structures adjacent to the world heritage”.
In the specific case of the ruins, and given “it is a historical monument, it was necessary to consider the specificities of the aspect and structure, as well as the location and the surrounding environment”, and information on different lightning technologies ”was collected in order to install an appropriate system.
Under yesterday's meeting of the Cultural Heritage Council, IC President also said that 19 requests from associations, production companies and traders, from the areas of religious customs, culinary techniques and handicrafts were received for candidacies for the title of intangible cultural heritage entity. The names chosen will then be released through the official bulletin.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:19:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Teaching | Classes return to about 80% of schools on Monday</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/27/ensino-aulas-regressam-a-cerca-de-80-das-escolas-na-segunda-feira/</link><description>The government set up a joint operation to make traffic and public transport flexible that next Monday about 80 percent of Macau's schools and childhood gardens will resume classes.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us his wife and daughter (cf. Recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: High there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

Helahoho! Helahoho!
The sewing machine of the poor widow killed to the bayonet…
She sews in the afternoon indeterminate ...

"The Russian Armed Forces are fulfilling the mission. They continue to attack military and paramilitary targets," said Kremlin (Presidency) spokesman Dmitri Peskov, after criticism of the EU Kiev bombing that caused at least 14 dead and damaged the European embassy.
"At the same time, Russia is still interested in continuing the negotiation process in order to achieve the objectives that were set by political and diplomatic means," he said, quoted by France-Presse (AFP) and Spanish EFE.
At least 14 people died and 48 were injured yesterday morning in Kiev due to a 629 russian massive attack and missiles against Ukrainian territory, Ukrainian authorities said. The previous balance indicated by the local authorities was eight dead and 45 injured.
Among the dead are three children, Ukrainian interior minister IHOR KLYMENKO said, citing preliminary data. The numbers are expected to increase, while the rescue teams remain on the ground to rescue people arrested under the rubble.
It was the first major Russian attack on Kiev in weeks, while the United States lead peace efforts.
According to the AFP news agency, Russia fired 598 drones and 31 ballistic and cruise missiles against Ukraine in a new massive attack during yesterday morning, citing data from the Ukrainian Air Force in a statement.
According to preliminary data, 563 combat drones and distraction drones, as well as 26 missiles, were slaughtered or blocked, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. The attacks hit the central part of Kiev, one of the few times the Russian attacks have reached the heart of the Ukrainian capital since the start of the large -scale invasion in February 2022.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:45:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Pyongyang criticizes southern leader for speaking of denuclearization</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/pyongyang-critica-lider-do-sul-por-falar-em-desnuclearizacao/</link><description>North Korea yesterday criticized what it described as the hypocrisy of South Korea President Lee Jae-Myung when talking about the possible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang said South Korea is the “only country that has delivered all sovereignty to the United States,” according to an editorial published by the North Korean state news agency KCNA.
The North Korean agency, which transmits Pyongyang's official position on national and international politics, has lamented that Seoul is promoting "empty illusions about denuclearization." He reaffirmed that North Korea will never deliver the nuclear weapons it has.
"Lee must understand that continuing to feed this dream about denuclearization will not help anyone," he said, according to the Spanish news agency Europa Press. North Korea again defended the possession of nuclear weaponry, which considered that the geopolitical situation in the region was inevitable.
"Lee Jae-Myung has never hidden his true reasons: he is a maniac for confrontation," said KCNA. Lee said on Monday during a speech in Washington before President Donald Trump, who intends to work with the United States to "establish peace and achieve the denuclearization of the Korea Peninsula."
A day later, Pyongyang again criticized the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea in the region, ongoing 10 days ago, which described as hostile and demonstrations of the “desire to invade” the North Korean territory.
"Everyone knows that this is not a defensive, especially from a country that has the largest nuclear arsenal," said Kim Yong-Bok, a high official of the North Korean army, in reference to the United States.
Donald, the Peacemaker
At the meeting with Lee, Trump said he liked to meet again with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, with whom he met in 2018 and 2019, and admitted that he could try a summit between the two Koreas. Trump asked Lee to resume dialogue with Pyongyang and opened a "new era of peace in the Korean Peninsula."
Korea, which was colonized by Japan between 1910 and 1945, was divided by the United States and the Soviet Union in two administrative zones, separated by parallel 38, after World War II (1939-1945).
From this division resulted in the Korean War (1950-1953), which opposed the popular Democratic Republic of Korea (North), supported by the Soviet Union and China, and the Republic of Korea (South), supported by an international force led by the United States.
The armed conflict caused about 2.5 million dead, mostly Koreans, and ended with an armistice, but without a peace agreement, so technically Pyongyang and Seoul remain at war. The two Koreas remain divided by parallel 38, and a demilitarized zone near the village of Panmunjom was created, where the Armistício was signed on July 27, 1953.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:39:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Indian opposition criticizes Trump and government failure</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/oposicao-indiana-critica-trump-e-fracasso-do-governo/</link><description>Indian opposition classified Wednesday the new tariffs in the United States as “economic blackmail” and criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi, so he considers a failure of foreign policy that impairs national interests.
“The 50 percent rate of [Donald] Trump is an economic blackmail: an attempt to press India to accept an unfair trade agreement,” wrote the leader of the Indian National Congress Party (INC), Rahul Gandhi, on social networks.
Gandhi exhorted Modi to “not allow his weakness to prevail over the interests of the Indian people,” according to the Spanish news agency Efe.
In the same line, InC president Mallikarjun Kharge said that “a solid foreign policy requires substance and skill” and classified Modi's diplomacy as a superficial. "They have not been able to reach a trade agreement and are now failing to protect our country," he criticized.
The United States activated Wednesday the new 50 percent rates on India exports as a punishment for the purchase of oil to Russia, the target of sanctions due to the war against Ukraine. The new additional punitive rate is 25 percent. At issue, there are Indian exports of about $ 60 billion, according to EFE.
Russia has already been ready to absorb Indian exports most affected by US punishment. The hardest affected sectors are industries with high employability, such as textile, jewelry and precious stones, seafood and car components.
The United States has not punished sectors producing goods that are important to the companies themselves or the pocket of US citizens such as medicines and mobile phones.
Oil factor
US President Donald Trump initially announced a 25 percent rate on Indian products.
But in early August, he signed an executive order imposing an additional 25 percent rate due to Russian oil purchases by India, which raised combined tariffs imposed on Asian ally allied to 50 percent.
"Our [Russian oil] imports are based on market factors and are made with the general objective of ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people in India," said Nova Deli on August 7, the Hindustan Times newspaper recalled.
To face the measure, the Indian government announced Wednesday the promotion of textile products in markets that considered priority, including those from the UK, Japan and South Korea. India exports currently reach 220 countries and territories, but authorities said that 40 markets are fundamental to diversification.
The list also includes Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland, Canada, Mexico, Russia, Belgium, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Australia, according to The Times of India. The Federation of India Export Organizations (FIEO) expressed in a “maximum concern” statement and requested immediate government support from companies.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:37:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Final allegations end in the case of the tycoon Jimmy Lai</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/hong-kong-terminam-alegacoes-finais-em-caso-do-magnata-jimmy-lai/</link><description>The final allegations in the trial for national security violation of the media of media Jimmy Lai ended yesterday in Hong Kong, without being known the date of the verdict. Accused of sedition and collusion with foreign forces during the 2019 protests, of which he was one of the key figures, Jimmy Lai may face life imprisonment.
Lai declared himself innocent in this long trial, which began in December 2023 and ended yesterday, with the final allegations, with no scheduled date for the verdict. “We will inform the parts in a timely manner” on the date, said Judge Esther Toh.
Founder of the Liberal Journal Apple Daily, banned since June 2021, 77 -year -old Jimmy Lai has been arrested since 2020, being accused of having asked Western governments to have sanctions on China and the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong due to the repression of protests on the streets of the former British colony. Lai is also accused of producing seditous articles and contents, namely in editorials he has signed.
These two infractions are severely punished by the National Security Law adopted after the sometimes violent protests of 2019. The allegations took place over ten days after two postponements: one due to bad weather and another due to heart problems of Jimmy Lai. He eventually could watch the hearings after being medicated and equipped with proper medical equipment.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:36:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Cooperation | Russia and China perform first joint patrol with submarines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/29/cooperacao-russia-e-china-realizam-primeira-patrulha-conjunta-com-submarinos/</link><description>Russia and the Popular Republic of China first performed a joint submarine patrol mission in the Asia Pacific region, the Russian Navy Pacific fleet announced Wednesday.

China wants to work with “all peace -loving countries” and defend the achievements of World War II, the Chinese government said yesterday, in the presentation of the 80th anniversary ceremonies of the end of the conflict. A military stop will mark on September 3, in Beijing, the end of World War II in Asia and the defeat of fascism.
80 years ago, with "huge sacrifices", China occupied "the main front in Asia in the fight against fascism" during World War II, in a "important historical contribution" to the victory of the allies, recalled the spokesman for the Chinese Ministry Guo Jiakun.
Guo pointed out that, in that period, "many European countries and friends offered valuable assistance and even gave their lives, and their achievements will always be remembered by the Chinese people."
So far, “close 50 responsible leaders, sent to China and friends from 30 European countries have confirmed the presence” in these celebrations in the country, reflecting a shared desire to “preserve historical memory and defend peace and justice,” he said.
Asked about the absence of great Western powers, Guo replied that China organizes these events "to remember the story, honor the fallen, value peace and open the future."

Chinese President Xi Jinping will review the troops and speak at Tiananmen Square, in an event that will be attended by almost 30 heads of state and government, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
The parade will end a sequence of events, including the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which will take place between August 31 and September 1, in Tianjin (northeast of China), announced as “the largest” since the foundation of the organization on June 15, 2001.
World War II was parallel to the invasion of China through Japan (1931-1945) and the civil war between nationalists and communists in China (1927-1949), which established a truce to fight Japanese troops. The Japanese invasion caused more than 35 million casualties among Chinese troops and civilians until 1945, according to Beijing, representing a third of the casualties.</description><pubDate>2025-08-29 00:32:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Jimmy Lai Defense Purpose Final Allegations</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/28/hong-kong-defesa-de-jimmy-lai-prossegue-alegacoes-finais/</link><description>Hong Kong Jimmy Lai's defense of the media of the media jimmy Lai continued yesterday the presentation of the final allegations in a trial followed by the international community.
The hearing is surrounded by a large security device, which includes the presence of armed units and patrols with dogs outside the court, where at least a dozen official vehicles remain parked, according to local social media TA Kung Wen Wei.
Lai, 77, founder of the now defunct Apple Daily newspaper and three companies linked to the same editorial group, faces an accusation of “conspiracy to print and reproduce seditious material” and two of “conspiracy with foreign or external forces to endanger national security”.
The criminal frame applied to these accusations may lead to the businessman's life imprisonment. The final allegations phase began last week, in a process started in December 2023, marked by several postponements, including those registered in mid -August due to torrential rainfall and health problems of the accused.
During this week's sessions, the defense focused on refutation allegations of the accusations that Lai orchestrated a coordinated strategy to promote international sanctions against Hong Kong and Beijing through articles published in Apple Daily and alleged support to the activist group known as "Stand with Hong Kong," Hong Kong's press.
The entrepreneur's legal team argued that there is no evidence that Lai gave direct instructions to activists, nor that newspaper publications were incitement to sedition, insisting on the role of media “to facilitate public debate”.

"The evacuation of the city of Gaza is inevitable (…), each family that moves south will receive the most generous humanitarian aid as possible," said Army Arab spokesman Avichay Adraee, quoted by France-Presse news agency (AFP).
The UN calculates in about one million people the current population of the province of Gaza, which includes the city of Gaza and the surrounding area in the northern Palestinian territory devastated by almost two years of war.
Israel approved plans to take the city of Gaza and announced that it intends to force the population to transfer to the south of the territory, a project considered unrealistic and dangerous by humanitarian organizations.
The Arabic press reported on Tuesday that Egypt positioned about 40,000 armed forces staff in northern Sinai, which borders the Gaza Strip for fears a mass escape to its territory.
Papal appeals
Yesterday, Pope Leo XIV called for the full respect of humanitarian law in Gaza, particularly relative to the “indiscriminate use of force and forced displacement of populations”, in a new appeal to the end of the war.
The US pontiff made the appeal at the end of the general hearing in the Vatican City, asking the parts and the international community to commit to "ending the conflict in the Holy Land, which caused so much terror and death."
The head of the Catholic Church has asked "that all [Israelite] hostages be released, that there is a permanent ceasefire, that the safe entry of humanitarian aid is made, and which fully respects humanitarian law."
He mentioned “the obligation to protect civilians and the prohibition of collective punishment, the indiscriminate use of force and the forced displacement of populations,” according to the Spanish news agency Efe. Leão XVI also stated support for the joint statement made on Tuesday by the Greek, Teófilo III patriarchs, and Latin, Perbattista Pizzaballa, from Jerusalem.
The patriarchs asked "the end of the spiral of violence, the end of the war, and the priority of the common good of all peoples." In the joint statement, they asked the Israeli authorities to suspend the plan to take Gaza and transfer the city's population to the south of the Gaza Strip.
"This is not the right way. There is no reason to justify the deliberate and forced massive displacement of civilians," the ecclesiastical authorities said in a statement. They also announced that the clergy and nuns in Gaza decided to stay and continue to take care of all the people who found refuge at the facilities of the Christian churches.
After nearly two years of war, the UN declared on August 22 a hunger situation in the province of Gaza in the north of the territory, which happens for the first time in the Middle East.</description><pubDate>2025-08-28 00:04:02</pubDate></item><item><title>India / Pakistan | Rains kill 32 people dislodge thousands</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/28/india-paquistao-chuvas-matam-32-pessoas-desalojam-milhares/</link><description>Sudden water loads above normal for the time caused chaos and destruction in various areas of India and Pakistan
 
Intense rainfall that hit parts of Pakistan and India caused 32 dead and an indefinite number of missing in the Indian part of Caxemira, the Indian authorities announced yesterday.
The deaths and disappearances occurred in the Jammu region of India -controlled Caxemira, where sudden floods and landslide were recorded on a Hindu pilgrimage route, Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
The period when the deaths caused by floods were not immediately clear, according to the US Associated Press (AP) news agency.
Punjab province authorities in eastern Pakistan, yesterday asked the army's help in rescue and help efforts after torrential rains have overflowed large rivers. Several locations were flooded and more than 150,000 people were displaced, authorities said.
Rescue teams removed more than 20,000 people during Lahore's outskirts, Pakistan's second largest city, which also faced the risk of floods. People taken from the areas near Lahore lived along the Ravi River bed, said Punjab's disaster management authority, Irfan Ali Kathia.
The departure of residents from the most vulnerable areas began earlier this week in six Punjab districts.

Suddenly
The more intense than normal mronics rains and the liberation of water from the neighboring India caused sudden floods in low -altitude border regions, Kathia said.
Meteorologists predicted that rain will continue throughout the region during the week. Striky rains and sudden floods in the Himalayan region killed almost 100 people in August.
Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised local authorities for the timely removal of the population and said that emergency aid was being supplied to those affected by flooding, according to a government statement.
India warned Pakistan about possible transfronist floods through diplomatic channels, rather than the Indian Water Commission, which is the permanent mechanism under the Treaty of the Il, mediated by the World Bank in 1960.
Nova Delhi suspended the committee's work after the murder of 26 tourists in India -controlled Caxemira in April, although Islamabad insists that India cannot unilaterally terminate the treaty. The floods caused by the monsoon rains have killed more than 800 people in Pakistan since the end of June.
Scientists claim that climate change is intensifying monsoon rains in southern Asia, increasing fears of a 2022 climate disaster repetition, which reached a third of Pakistan and killed 1,739 people.
India is the country with the most population in the world, with more than 1.4 billion inhabitants, and Pakistan the fifth, with over 255 million. Monsoon designates seasonal winds related to the alternation between dry and rain stations in tropical and subtropical coastal regions.
From June to September, monsoon rains take place in southern Asia countries, such as India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Laos, according to the National Center for US atmospheric Research. From December to February, the monsoon rains move south of Ecuador towards Australia, while southern Asia goes through dry season conditions.</description><pubDate>2025-08-28 00:01:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, Academic: “China is a reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended at the University of Aveiro the doctoral thesis that analyzes how China has been positioned in recent decades as an important actor in the “global health governance”. Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that the willingness already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages ​​in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary general has ensured that he had “pleasing to work with all parties,” but stressed that this is a “decision that is up to central governments to make” and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, it is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new fund's new direction "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, if by case the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibility of rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish-speaking institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo.

Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the right place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macao, Camões has been poorly used in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani.

Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Motorsport: FIA continues to dream of a Chinese team at F1</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/15/automobilismo-fia-continua-a-sonhar-com-uma-equipa-chinesa-na-f1/</link><description>It's no secret to anyone: the International Automobile Federation (FIA) would like to have a Chinese team in the F1 World Championship. FIA President Mohammed Ben Suulaym is the first to demonstrate this will.
For the first time since 2015, F1 will receive a 11th team on the starting grid next season, with Cadillac's entry, putting an end to a three-year wait since the US team presented its candidacy following the FIA ​​appeal for demonstrations of interest. As there will be a margin for a 12th team, Ben Suulayem is willing to launch a new process of manifestation of interest, making it clear that an application from China would be welcome.
The entry of a Chinese team would be aligned with F1's strategic efforts to expand its presence in key markets. China's Grand Prix has recently renewed its contract by 2030, consolidating the country's role in the long -term view of the sport.
"We have a 11th team [Cadillac]. I believe we should analyze the performance of this 11th team and then if there is a Chinese [candidacy]-and I will now speak on behalf of Fom [Formula One Management]-they will approve it, because it is about sustaining the business," said the FIA ​​president in a joint interview with several journalists from the automobile sector.
Ben Suulayem made it clear that there is no urgent need to have a 12th team. However, given F1's upward trajectory in recent years, the addition of another team to the starting grid, especially one from China, would further increase the call of the sport in the largest business market on the planet. "If there is a team from China, let's say, and the first to approve - and I'm 100% sure that it will approve it - would no longer make money with China's entry? I believe yes," he said.
A huge market for exploring
The Chinese automotive market is incomparable, producing more than 30 million vehicles a year - more than the United States of America, Japan and India together. In addition, China has contributed to the increase in the fan base in sports, with over 150 million fans and more than 1 million new followers on Chinese social networks, increasing the total to 4.3 million. F1 fan segmentation analysis itself has revealed that more than half of fans in the country have started following the sport in the last four years. Interestingly, the audience is younger than the average F1 supporters and more diverse, with a 50% female demography.
For Ben Sulayem, it is more than just increasing the number of teams: it is to unite the main global markets under the F1 flag, because the number of Chinese sponsors and partners in the “Queen Class” of motor sport is currently limited, boiling down to the official Aston Martin Content Creation Partner, and Sauber's Sensetime. The presence of the Chinese brand Yili, which in the meantime came out, and the Sensetime in the Sauber universe was undoubtedly linked to the fact that Zhou Guanyu, the first full -time Chinese driver at F1, running the Swiss team at the time the agreements were signed.

Geely in pole-position
The dream of a Chinese team may still be in an embryonic phase, but with the support of the president of FIA and the growing focus of the sport in China, the view of a Chinese brand on F1's starting grids may be getting closer to reality. A Chinese brand like Geely could naturally fit into F1, taking into account its global presence and the fact that it stops international brands reputed such as Volvo or Lotus, appearances as a shareholder at Aston Martin and Mercedes-Benz Group, and Joint Ventures with Renault.
It is also worth mentioning that, recently, Lotus Cars, owned by Geely, recovered the name Team Lotus, bringing together its competition programs with official support, partner teams, lotus coup championships and drivers development programs. According to the company, the Renaissance of Team Lotus "means our commitment to global competition and the culture of motorized sport." For now, this is limited to GT cars, but one cannot help but imagine where it may evolve in the future.
Lotus Group has been the property of Geely since 2017. Team Lotus team was a constant presence in Formula 1 between 1954 and 1994, and there were some attempts to reactivate the name linked to their historic past in F1, attempts that ended just over nine years ago. In addition to the Lotus Sports Program and others of regional or national work, Geely is also present in Auto Sport with Lynk &amp; Co, at FIA TCR World Tour, and through its partnership with Renault, as a engine supplier, in the Chinese F4 Championship.</description><pubDate>2025-08-15 16:34:43</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FR World Cup will have a new car in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/06/gp-taca-do-mundo-de-fr-tera-novo-carro-em-2026/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) has recently revealed some details about the future of the Regional Formula (FR), the discipline that currently gives body to the Macao Grand Prix and which, from 2026, will finally have a new monolugar - faster and more safe
 
Initially baptized by FIA as F3 Regional, the now designated regional formula (FR) is above the Formula 4 Formula 4 National Competitions and FIA Championship, which, in turn, supports the FIA ​​Formula 2 Championship and Formula 1. Last year, the FIA ​​decided that this category was the one that best filed the Guide Circuit, thus ending four decades of Formula 3 Macao Award.
Last week, the regulator of world motorsport and the Italian national sports association has jointly presented the future monoligue that will compete in the European regional FIA (FREC in English) regional formula championship and will succeed the current freka. The fact that the acronym has lost the letter “A” is due to the exit of the Alpine brand as a partner and engine supplier to the championship. FRECA premiered in 2019, succeeding the Formula Renault Eurocup. In recent seasons, more than 160 pilots, representing 44 nationalities and 22 teams, participated in the championship. This category has gained importance in the FIA ​​monologene pyramid, having as old pilots former champion Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Isack Hadjar, Gabriel Bortoleto and Franco Colapinto-all of them now militate in Formula 1.
The competition will have the FIA ​​support seal and should be the largest supplier of teams and pilots for the FR World Cup of the Macao Grand Prix from next year. FIA involvement in the competition is intended to generate more revenues for it, something that may have reflexes on the price scale. The FR championships in the Americas and Japan, as well as the FIA ​​-certified trophies in the Middle East and Oceania will continue, and progressively will introduce the new car produced in Italy.
FIA President Mohammed Ben Suulayem believes this project "will create a stronger and more support for young pilots. With the full support of the FIA ​​regions and a clear progression vision, we are taking an important step to ensure the future of junior monoliga pyramid." Former Ralis pilot and today maximum leader of automobile sports, who was recently in the territory for the FIA ​​general assembly, said that “accessibility, international credibility and cost efficiency are at the center of this initiative.”
New car promises more
The new Tatuus T-326, the second-generation FR monolugar, is equipped with a 3-cylinder and 1.6 liter Toyota engine, which debits 270 horsepower and 360 Nm of torque, specially adapted and prepared by ATM-Autotechnic Motori. The T-326 represents a natural evolution of the T-318 model, the Tatuus monolugar that defined most FR championships worldwide and says goodbye to the big stages next November, during the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix. The second edition of FR's FR World Cup will continue to use the Tatuus T-318 Monolugar, motorized by a 1.75-liter Turbo Alpha Romeo block, also prepared by ATM-Autotechnic Motori, but the Italian brand has failed to manufacture.
The future car, which will use a new special tire built by Pirelli, will have a fully redesigned aerodynamic profile, shaped by the new FIA technical regulations for the category and inspired by the latest trends in the top categories of single -molding. The result is a general increase in performance, better aerodynamic efficiency and reduction of turbulence effect, which will facilitate overtaking.
Main improvements include weight reduction, optimized direction rack and magazine suspension, offering greater lightness and ease of driving. Security remains a key pillar in all Italian tatus projects, and this car is no exception. Chassis further increased its impact resistance. Crucial elements such as front and rear impact absorption structures, anti-intrusion panels and roll bar have been updated to meet the latest safety standards. In addition to safety, the cockpit is designed to maximize pilot's comfort and ergonomics, welcoming both men and women in a wider range of heights, ensuring the best conditions to compete on track.</description><pubDate>2025-08-06 23:59:42</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Invitations for TCR Asia pilots who participate in Korea and Zhuzhou</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/27/gp-convites-para-pilotos-tcr-asia-que-participem-na-coreia-e-zhuzhou/</link><description>The 72nd Macao Grand Prix Race will again be the stage of the final test of Kumho Fia TCR World Tour, the largest tourist cars competition worldwide under the seal of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). The test will be equally open to the participation of competitors from other supplies
 
Being the last stage of the TCR worldwide competition season, the Macao race will bring together the fastest tour pilots in the world, also crowning the absolute champion of the TCR World Tour. The unique format of the competition promoted by WSC Group will allow local and regional riders of TCR to face international stars, creating an unforgettable show on the streets of the territory.
Prior to the final in Macao, the resurrected TCR Asia Series will share the track with the TCR World Tour from October 17-19, at the Inje, South Korea circuit, and from October 31 to November 2 at the Zhuzhou International Circuit in China. Participation in this race will be mandatory for riders who wish to obtain an invitation to the Guide Circuit event, also providing an opportunity for Macao riders, who did not qualify in other competitions, ensure a place at the big holiday party.
"In 2025, Wildcard registrations will be available to competitors who participated in TCR Asia events. To be eligible to sign up for Macao, competitors will be able to participate in the next races in South Korea and China, where TCR Asia will also share the grid with TCR World Tour," wrote TCR Asia Series on social networks, stressing that: “It's a unique opportunity for life: measuring forces with the best in the world in one of the most legendary strokes of motorized sport.”
On the subject, WSC Group president Marcello Lotti, the father of the TCR concept, added: “We are proud that TCR Asia added two events in conjunction with Kumho Fia tcr world tour. WSC is pleased to confirm that we will assign 'Wildcards' to competitors who want to join us in the final of the season in Macau.”
TCR Asia Series has been competing with Chinese Sailun tires, but in this race the pilots will have to adapt to Kumho compounds, required in the FIA ​​-sanctioned competition. Sean Chang Chien Shang, Taiwan's pilot, leads the four -point lead ranking about Chinese Liu Zhi Chen, both at the Audi RS 3 LMS steering wheel.
GUARANTEED QUALITY
TCR Asia Series will not be the only competition to compose the FIA ​​TCR World Tour subscribers list at the MSA, as the 2025 season of TCR Australia will end in style when joining the Macao's 72nd guide race grid, which will take place from 13 to 16 November. TCR Australia's first international participation was possible thanks to the Global Championship rights holder, the WSC Group, which will ensure the full coverage of transportation costs to Australian teams traveling to Macao.
TCR Australia announced in June that it will focus on the proprietary of the competition at the event “The Bend 500”, from 12 to 14 September, in conjunction with the Australian round of Kumho Fia TCR World Tour, a competition with more than a dozen-time competitors. The Australian competition, which once had starting grids with about two dozen cars, will no longer run this year, beyond this and that scheduled for the Macao Grand Prix.
Also with evidence for playing in Australia, South Korea, China and Macau, the title champion of Kumho Fia World Tour, Yann Ehrlacher of Lynk &amp; Co, leads the 250 points, followed by Esteban Guerrieri, the wheel of a Honda, with 223, while Santiago Urrutia, also to the command of a Lynk &amp; Co, occupies a Lynk &amp; Co. Third position with 215 points.</description><pubDate>2025-08-27 01:54:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Philippines | Carlos Barreto takes the experience of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/20/filipinas-carlos-barreto-leva-a-experiencia-de-macau/</link><description>Carlos Barreto, former racing director of the Macao de Motorcycle Grand Prix, is still active in the motorized sports of the Asian continent, more precisely in the Philippines, where he has been putting into practice the experience of more than three decades in the service of Macau's motorsport and motorcycling
 
“I was invited in 2024 to help develop National Track Motorcycle Championships-Underbone, Scooters and Superbikes-organized by Morac and Fetap,” Macau's former Macau-China General Association (AAMC) told HM. “The experience gained over three dozen years helps. I have done several motorcycle and karting championships on temporary circuits, mud and nape, then in the coloane karting, trials with local riders (motorcycles and karts) and international (karts). several motorcycle championships. ”
With a strong connection to the Macao Grand Prix, Carlos Barreto was a test director in the Karting and Motorcycle Championships between 1991 and 1996, and later, between 2004 and 2008. He was also president of the College of Sports Commissioners between 2009 and 2010. This vast experience allows him today to face this new reality in a different country, but always showed great passion for motorized sports, ease of “some aspects. that deserved more attention to the level of the tests. ” Among them, it highlights “sports regulations, the application of the rules, the dissemination of official documentation, some infrastructure equipment, as well as the structure and functional organization of the team that generates these championships, from the secretariat to track commissioners and proof direction”.
This collaboration began in November last year and, by 2024, already extended to three rounds of the championships. The contribution of Portuguese, born in Mozambique, has been significant: “The various suggestions I presented to each of the two circuits I know, the Clark International Speedway and the Racing Circuit Batangas, some have already been implemented and the rest will be resolved by the end of the year.
The competition itself is also growing: “The pandemia, in a way, delayed the development of these championships, but the number of pilots has been increasing, there are teams with financial capacity and good equipment. Clark tests sometimes come together to gather close to 80 pilots, while Batangas have about 60. The prospects are encouraging.”
Contribution to Karting
The Philippines is a country with a long tradition in Karting, dating back to the 1960s and the enthusiasm generated by Arsenio “Dodjie” Laurel, a pilot who lost his life on the Guide Circuit in 1967. The presence of Philippine Teams and Pilots in the Asian continent is common and, internally, the discipline has always followed what has been done worldwide.
“At Karting level, national tests have a local and functional structure - for years it was Akoc,” recalls Carlos Barreto, adding: “My collaboration has been a sports commissioner at two international events in the Philippines. I did one in 2024 and another recently, the Fifth Rok Cup Asia Philippines, organized by Kilton Motors Corporation (KMC) and performed in Clark. ”
Also there, the former director of the Macao International Kart Prize (2004-2016), the 46th SKF World Championship of CIK-Sfi (2009) and the 49th Cik-Cia World Championship (2012), had the task of “auscultation of people and answering the questions that put me, as well as having suggestions for improvement”.
As for the future, Carlos Barreto believes that “the seed is launched, and now it remains to be expected to grow and that the results will become visible in the medium term.”
Macao a step ahead
For the author of the book “History of Karting in Macao”, written in co -authorship with Pedro Dá Mesquita, the MSar remains a step forward with the sports organization of this nature. “Macau has a clear advantage, but it must be borne in mind that events in Macao have the precious support of government entities, while in the Philippines it is an organization without these supports,” says Carlos Barreto.
Still, the evidence in the Philippines, a country with a vast history in the motorized Southeast Asia sport, are nothing to do with what is done in the territory in terms of competitiveness. "At the event level, scooter races are often very excited and competitive, with six to eight riders fighting every lap in the first place, numerous overtaking and suspense until cutting the goal. In superbike events, they compete for ducatis and enclosures and there is always a spectacle.</description><pubDate>2025-08-20 00:55:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Nürburgring Nordschleife is a new favorite stage of Chinese brands</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/nurburgring-nordschleife-e-novo-palco-predilecto-das-marcas-chinesas/</link><description>In the middle of the Eifel forest - in German, Eifelwald - Two cars with Chinese enrollment are parked in front of a hotel unit. The scenario appears to be intriguing at first glance, but it is not.
Nürburgring Nordschleife, in Rhineland-Palatinado, already close to the Belgium and Luxembourg border, has become the favorite stage of new Chinese automobile builders to show the world that they can also measure forces with their European, American and Asian rivals with regard to high performance vehicles.
Chinese automotive industry bet is strongly concentrated in NEVs - “New Energy Vehicles” - as part of the strategy for reducing pollution, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and boosting innovation in the automotive industry. China represented almost two thirds of global electric vehicle sales in 2024, and their builders, all relatively new, discuss Taco the Taco with the large traditional builders a piece of this appetizing market.
It is undisputed that the growth of sales of this type of vehicles in the world has not been accompanied at the same speed by the evolution of technology applicable to automobile sport, especially with regard to electric vehicles (EVs).
The World Formula World Championship and is the only truly global competition for electric vehicles, after the fiasco and the premature death of the FIA ​​- FIA etcouring world cup. With no alternatives to affirm their everyday products on the tracks, Chinese brands headed in weight to Nürburgring Nordschleife, known to be one of the favorite places of European car manufacturers to test high performance cars.
The “green hell”, a name given by the legendary pilot Jackie Stewart due to its difficulty and the density of the surrounding forest, is a circuit with over 20 kilometers and 170 curves, combining fast lines, technical sections and sharp unenforcement. Many return records are measured here for sports and super -sports car cars, making Nordschleife an unavoidable reference to car performance.
Chapters for History
In 2017, Nio became known to the western world when it established a record with its EP9 electric supercar. The vehicle completed a circuit of 20.8 km in 6 minutes and 45.90 seconds, becoming the fastest production car at the time to travel the famous Germanic layout.
This feat has evidenced the ability of Nio and Chinese industry to compete with brands established in the high performance cars segment. Two years later, Lynk &amp; Co, the first Chinese brand to win a race in the guide circuit, with model 03 Cyan Concept, a high performance version of the Sedan 03, reached a time back in 7 minutes and 20,143 seconds, setting a new record for four -door cars.
Brands such as Zeekr, MG and Lotus passed the old stage of the Formula 1 German Grand Prix, until, in 2024, Xiaomi arrived with a crash. With a production version of the SU7 Ultra, it registered a time of 7 minutes and 4.957 seconds, surpassing rivals such as Porsche Taycan Turbo GT and Rimac Snowra. To keep up with the sales success of your car, the electronic technology brand was even further: Last month, the Su7 Ultra Prototype, built in partnership with Prodrive, reached an impressive 6-minute and 22.091 seconds, becoming the third fastest car of all time on the circuit, behind only the Porsche 919 Hybrid and Volkswagen ID.R.R.
These results from Xiaomi had a significant impact, both in the western and home press, as well as proof of the international affirmation of an industry that wants to be an undisputed leader with regard to Nev vehicles. On the other hand, Xiaomi took the opportunity to “surf the wave” and launched in the market a special limited edition of Su7 -all -how.
More will come
Nürburgring Nordschleife is part of the Chinese auto industry vocabulary and the trend is for an even stronger presence of Chinese brands in the coming years on the German track.
"I believe it was the decision of Xiaomi that brought greater attention to the definition of records back in Nürburgring," explained Chinese journalist Bruno Qi to HM. “With a huge media influence in China and a high profile CEO like Jun Law, Xiaomi attracted a significant focus on this scenario. After Nio's success, this was another strong performance of a Nürburgring high -performance electric vehicle.”
Xiaomi, which already names a bend of the German circuit, may want to improve its time back, while other Chinese brands seek to follow the trend - even to show off on a respected and good memories.
"Brands like Yangwang (BYD's luxury brand) have also sent their models for time attempts around," says Chinese publication journalist Bec Motorsport. “I think Chinese auto builders have now found a relevant opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of their high performance electrical platforms, and this strategy is already helping to boost sales.” Also, at the end of the day, what weighs is what is sold.</description><pubDate>2025-08-01 01:14:03</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA has already defined what the F4 World Cup will be like</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/25/gp-fia-ja-definiu-como-sera-a-taca-do-mundo-de-f4/</link><description>The Macao Grand Prix hosts the first edition of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup, between November 13 and 16 this year. The International Automobile Federation has published the Sports Regulation, which reveals some details about what will be the latest cup in the world integrated into the 72nd Macau Grand Program
 
Registration for the Formula 4 Macao Race - Formula 4 World Cup of the International Automobile Federation (FIA) is open until July 30, and FIA is the selection of the pilots who will participate. FIA responsible will have been pre-selected by the best Formula 4 national championship riders, also encouraging all the pilots interested in directly contacting the FIA ​​and providing details of their sports history to be considered.
The final list of twenty pilots will be confirmed through an official invitation letter, taking into account the current classification of the pilots in the respective championships. The final selection should only be made public in mid -October, as is tradition in the guide circuit test.
At a time when behind the scenes, it is spoken of the possibility of increasing the minimum age of formula 4 to 16 years, the sports regulation stipulates that all pilots must be at least 15 years old, and the birthday is binding. An inscribed pilot may not have participated in more than two races of a championship with any type of monolugar that has been conceived and/or built to achieve a power-to-weight ratio of less than 3.0 kg/hp, which prevents participation in this riders running regional formula seasons or Formula 3.
The sports regulation does not specify technical details, but in previous communications, the FIA ​​had already confirmed that Mintimes - organizer of the F4 Chinese Championship - will be the “unique operator” of the race, together with FFSA (Fédération Française Du Sport Automobile (FFSA), responsible for the world's cup technical support. In practice, all competitors will use Mygale M21-F4 singlesules, recently re-baptized as Ligier JS F422.
These formulas, equipped with 1.3 -liter Turbo Renault engines, will be rented to teams from the interior of China and operated by a single technical team - the same that organizes the French F4 Championship. Pirelli will be the exclusive tire supplier, as is the case with the Macao Grand Prix of Regional Formula and the FIA ​​GT World Cup.
Although the official time of the event has not yet been released, it is known that the World Cup will feature a qualification race played over 8 laps, or at most 60 minutes, most likely on Saturday. The main race will be held on Sunday, with 10 laps or, equally, a maximum of 60 minutes. Prior to that, a 40 -minute free training session will take place, followed by a qualification session with the same duration.
PATACA AND POINTS
About 350,000 patacas in monetary awards will be distributed to the competitors present in this first cup of the world, with the winner of the main race to raise eight thousand US dollars. As a curiosity, all participants will receive three hundred dollars of participation-the same value attributed to the pole-position of Saturday's qualification race and the rider who reaches the highest tip speed during the event.
More important than the monetary awards, the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup winner on the streets of Macau will win two points for the super license - points that may be decisive to access the restricted Formula 1 world. The winner will also be forced to attend the FIA ​​awards ceremony, which will take place on December 12 in Tashkentão, USBekistan.</description><pubDate>2025-07-25 05:01:08</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
