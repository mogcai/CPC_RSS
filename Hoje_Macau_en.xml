At a press conference yesterday in Tokyo, during his state visit, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said that Brazil has "two decisions to make" in response to 25 percent rates that came into force this month: the first is to resort to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and, if it does not work, "resort to other tools".
Lula specifically mentioned the option of “increasing tariffs on American products” imported by Brazil, which defined as “putting into practice the law of reciprocity”. "What we can't do is be silent, thinking that only they can impose tariffs," he said.
"I am very concerned about US government policy because of these rates on all products from all countries," Lula told the press in Tokyo at the end of his visit when asked about the new 25 percent tariffs on all US imported cars from April 2, announced the day before Trump.
"I am concerned because free trade is being harmed, because multilateralism is being defeated, and I am concerned because the American president is not the sheriff of the world, he is only the president of the United States," said the Brazilian leader.
Instead of imposing “unilateral measures”, Lula considers that it would be more appropriate to “talk to other leaders” to reach a beneficial price policy agreement for all parties.
"Honestly, I don't know the benefit of increasing tariffs on the cars bought in Japan," said the Brazilian leader of Asian country, one of the most affected by new commercial measures in the United States, given the weight of his automotive industry.
"The only thing this is going to do is to make cars more expensive for US consumers and increase inflation," said Lula, who also pointed out the risk of higher prices leading to economic contraction.
Leaders according to
Lula arrived in Japan on Monday for a four-day state visit, which ended yesterday, before going to Vietname, where he is expected to meet Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, and Vietnamese President Luong Cuong.
In a summit held the day before Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, the two leaders agreed to launch joint decarbonization initiatives and reinforce commercial ties, with a future free trade agreement between the Asian country and Mercosur on the horizon and the current context of commercial war and climate negationism.
During the visit, the Brazilian president stressed the message that democracy, free trade and multilateralism are in danger worldwide in the face of increased protectionism, authoritarianism, and the “new cold war” between the United States and China.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:33:17</pubDate></item><item><title>MIECF | Deputy Minister guarantees that he stopped building coal centers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/miecf-vice-ministro-garante-que-parou-de-construir-centrais-a-carvao/</link><description>The Deputy Minister of Chinese Ecology and Environment, Sun Jinlong, announced yesterday that China has stopped building new coal centers, unlike in an academic report released in February.

Of the largest group, which used eight goldsmiths as a facade were arrested 33 people, seized 18 million dollars from Hong Kong. PJ estimates that the group, which has been operating since 2019, will have changed funds equivalent to 590 million Patacas
 
The Judicial Police (PJ) dismantled two criminal groups on Tuesday who were dedicated to changing Renminbis to Hong Kong dollars. The largest case, which was the focus of a PJ press conference yesterday, concerns a group that had been operating since 2019. Authorities have detained 33 people, 22 local and 11 residents of China, and seized about 18 million dollars from Hong Kong (HKD) in cash, some game sheets, 48 ​​electronic devices and 12 accounting and false transaction books that put the group's operations to the naked.
Since the beginning of the scheme, which began in 2019 with advanced capital by the group's head, will have earned more than 20 million patacas in illegal profits following the change of money in an approximately 590 million patacas.
According to details of the PJ investigation, quoted by the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, the group wore eight jewelery located in the vicinity of Casinos no Cotai as a facade to exchange money to play at the gambling tables. The scheme was to find gamblers, lead them to stores where they simulated the purchase of products, with the transactions recorded in fake taping of jewelery to hide the illegal money exchange.
In both directions
The PJ added that the group in addition to offering Hong Kong dollars after receiving the bank transfer from players, if they were lucky at the game tables could resort to false jewelery to switch back to renminbis via bank transfer.
Tuesday's operation mobilized about 80 criminal investigators, who separated among the various jewelery involved, as well as pledge houses, a office in a mall and several homes.
It was added yesterday that the group had a narrow connection with a clandestine bank in the North Zone of the Macao Peninsula, which collaborated in operations in the transfer and circulation of money, with a view to escaping the supervision of the authorities. The group's profits were found based on the variation of exchange rates. Authorities have indicated that they will continue to investigate the source and flow of the capital and seek suspects that have not been arrested now.
The PJ announced yesterday that it also dismantled another group of criminals dedicated to the same type of offense, which will have changed about 200 million HKD and found 1 million HKD in improper profits.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:17:51</pubDate></item><item><title>IAS | Smart Creche Funding</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/ias-cortado-financiamento-a-creche-smart/</link><description>The reasons for the cutting cut was not clarified by the government, which merely indicated that it was unable to reach agreement with the Zonta Club of Macau Association, responsible for the exploration of space, on “basic principle” and “important aspects of organization”
 
The Institute of Social Action (IAS) will cut the financing and recover the installed facilities and equipment of the Smart Nursery, operated by the Zonta Club of Macao Association. The information has recently been revealed, but is generating a wave of concern from parents, who fear for the future of children's education.
The reasons that led to the end of the support of the government of the daycare center were not made public. In explanations to Radio Macau's Chinese channel, IAS has stated that the end of financing is not related to any problem with the daycare operation. However, IAS indicated that it was not possible to reach an agreement with the Zonta Club of Macao Association on the molds in which the financing partnership would continue to function, which is in force until August this year.
The broadcaster also points out that IAS indicated that the lack of agreement aimed at “basic principle” and “important aspects of organization”, without further details, which was justified by the fact that the association could still bring the case to the courts of MSAR.
SECURITY TRANSFERS
While confirming the end of public funding for day care, IAS also assured the guardians to be available to help with children's transfers to other day care centers when the Smart nursery closes. The guardians were also informed about the outcome in question and the available options.
The IAS has linked that there are enough vacancies for all children who will have to be transferred, including the mud, where the Smart day care center is located. Currently, IAS reported, the day care centers more than 80 children and about half will enter into kindergartens in the new school year.
Despite the guarantees, during the Macao Forum program, several parents were concerned about having to transfer children in late August, when the closing is expected.
US connections
Smart is explored by the Macao Zonta Club Association, which according to the official portal of the day care center, has been an association linked to the international zone organization, since 2014. This is a non -profit organization founded in 1919 in the United States, which has as its mission the affirmation of women's professional role, through philanthropic, social and cultural initiatives. It has more than 30,000 members worldwide, between 1,200 associations in 67 countries and regions.
At Macao, he currently has president Christiana Ieong and has the support of businesswoman Pansy Ho, as an honorary partner.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:12:45</pubDate></item><item><title>CCAC | WARNING FOR SITUATIONS OF POSSIBLE ELECTORAL CORRUPTION</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/ccac-alerta-para-situacoes-de-possivel-corrupcao-eleitoral/</link><description>Commissioner against corruption, Wong Kim Fong, said that inducing voters to sign list of applications through benefits is electoral corruption. The statements arise after being claimed that an elderly woman was invited to sign a list for the elections while exchanging the Macau Pass card, among other suspected cases
 
Electoral corruption is not limited to the exchange of interests and goods for votes, or benefits to readers. At this stage, the constitution of lists for legislative elections, "if any individual uses benefits to induce voters to sign the application for the event organizer, or the event organizer or who receives benefits commits the crime of electoral corruption."
The explanation was given by the commissioner's deputy against corruption, Wong Kim Fong, in a clarification session organized by the Legislative Assembly Commission of Electoral Assembly (Caeal) and the Commissioner Against Corruption (CCAC), on electoral procedures for legislative elections.
It is recalled that recently arisen that one of the elderly woman who was invited to sign a list for the elections while exchanging the Macau Pass card in an association to participate in the Grand Prix of Consumption. It was also alleged that school teachers would have been requested by associations to collect signatures to set up candidates and that a member of an association has been required to collect a minimum number of signatures. About this last allegation of pressure to collect signatures, the president of Caeal, Judge Seng Ioi Man, said on Wednesday night that the commission sought additional information, "but to date, no response was received"
Despite these suspicions, the president of Caeal revealed that by Tuesday no formal complaints had been filed.
Beyond borders
The CCAC representative also assured that arriving at the campaign phase, already with the lists defined, "will strictly fight illicit means, namely, fraud through threat, coercion related to employment, mistakes, violence, among others, to influence voter voting intention."
During the clarification session, in which about 220 people participated, the issue of supervision for campaign activities organized in Hengqin was raised. Seng Ioi Man indicated that violations of the electoral law outside Macao are also likely to be punished, not directly mentioning the deepened cooperation zone, in statements quoted by the Chinese channel of Radio Macau.
Through police and judicial cooperation, the president of Caeal refers to effective mechanisms to combat violations of the electoral law outside the territory of the MSAR.
Seng Ioi Man asked the population to denounce suspicions of electoral corruption or other irregularities, with “detailed and concrete information, including the form of direct personal contact”, so that Caeal and the law enforcement agencies focus efforts on tracking and investigating complaints.
It is recalled that the election campaign will take place between August 30 and September 12, and residents go to the polls on September 14 to choose the cast of deputies elected directly to the Legislative Assembly.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:07:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Haião | Sam Hou Fai calls for reinforcement of cooperation with hengqin</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/hainao-sam-hou-fai-pede-reforco-da-cooperacao-com-hengqin/</link><description>The Chief Executive went through Haião to participate in the annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia 2025, and had a meeting with the Secretary of the Communist Party Provincial Committee of China, who suggested reinforcing cooperation between Haião and Hengqin
 
The Chief Executive requested the reinforcement of cooperation between the cooperation zone in Hengqin and the Haião Free Commerce Port. The proposal was presented to the Secretary of the Provincial Committee of Haião of the Communist Party of China and president of the Permanent Committee of the Provincial Popular Assembly, Feng Fei, at a meeting on Wednesday.
According to the official version of the meeting, Sam Hou Fai said he was "very happy to see the progress obtained by the creation of Haião's Free Commerce Port." The province that is located on an island is regularly regarded as Hawaii de China, and is one of the major Chinese tourism centers, as well as having a preferential regime at the level of tax payment.
During the meeting, Sam Hou Fai "underlined the deep and long time between the two regions", and "the good base of cooperation between the two parts in the sectors of tourism, health and education."
At the level of future partnerships, the Chief Executive said there is room to reinforce cooperation through Mountain Island, since "Hungqin's cooperation zone and Haião's free trade port have identical political aspects." The resemblance is not surprising, as the two zones are part of the interior jurisdiction. Sam stressed that these similarities can “enhance the […] unique advantages, widening the exchange of cooperation” between the regions “for mutual benefits”.
About Macao, Sam indicated that he is "accelerating with determination the impetus to the proper and diversified development of the economy" to achieve "high quality growth of society and the economy." Macao's government leader also said he was “an expectant of development opportunities through pragmatic cooperation between the two regions”.
Hengqin as a reference
In turn, Feng FEI indicated that the Haião Free Commerce Port will enter this year in operation as an autonomous customs zone and which was based on inspiration on the “several successful experiences of the Hengqin cooperation zone”. Feng FEI also pointed out that Haião will follow the development of the cooperation zone, to be inspired by the latest successes.
The ruler also acknowledged that "the structure of the industries of Haimão and Macao have common aspects, where the proportion of the tourist sector is higher, hoping that both deepen cooperation, reinforcing the union for a new chapter of cooperation in various areas between the two territories."
Sam Hou Fai was in Haião with a delegation from Macao to participate in the annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:04:27</pubDate></item><item><title>MNE | BIR OF PORTUGUESE AND EPM are topics to discuss with Paulo Rangel</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/mne-bir-de-portugueses-e-epm-sao-temas-a-discutir-com-paulo-rangel/</link><description>During the visit to Macao of Portuguese Foreign Minister, Amelia António and Miguel de Senna Fernandes want to discuss the end of access to BIR access by Portuguese. The president of the House of Portugal in Macau associates this article with the position of Lisbon in the issue of 5G
 
It is another visit of a Portuguese ruler to Macau, but Paulo Rangel's first as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the executive of Luis Montenegro, at a time when the country is preparing to go to votes in May after the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic.
After a journey through China, Paulo Rangel will meet with local associative leaders in order to perceive existing problems related to the Portuguese community.
At HM, Amelia António, president of the House of Portugal in Macau (CPM), argues that the difficulties of obtaining residence by Portuguese should be one of the pressing matters. “My expectation is not high. I would like the Minister, after visiting China, to say something friendly, as relationships have been very loose. I would like to see this relationship resumed as usual and also that we were not as followers of the positions of the European Union (EU) so fierce, because we have very special interests and we have a very large Portuguese community. of the EU, and this should not be lost sight of. ”
Amelia António highlights the position that Portugal adopted in the case of Rede 5G and Huawei, but also “the development that occurred in relation to the coming of Portuguese to Macau, subject to Blue Card”. “I have the feeling that everything comes following this EU policy against China. Portugal must have a position to safeguard these interests.”
Speaking to Lusa, the official made similar complaints. "We are here, we suffer the consequences of these relationships [between Portugal and China], good or bad. We had very close relations for a long time, which changed with Covid. I have not seen things again as they were, and I think it was important that Mr. Minister explains what is the position," he said that Portugal does not have to "align faithfully with everything in Europe and, above all,"
Before the pandemic, he recalled the official, there was “permanent communication” and “much exchange” between the Portuguese and Chinese authorities.
Today is noticeable a “hardening regarding the Portuguese” in macao immigration, Maria Amelia António declared, but not being able to affirm categorically whether the position is related to “this removal” between China and the West.
Macao authorities have not accepted new requests for residence in the territory for Portuguese for the “exercise of specialized technical functions”, allowing for justification of family reunion or previous connection to the territory.
Also Miguel de Senna Fernandes, lawyer and president of the Macanese Association, regrets the situation of the assignment of the BIR. "I would like the Government of the Portuguese Republic to take into account the Portuguese community in the territory, which faces some difficulties regarding the possibility of obtaining the residence. It is a topic that may be addressed between the Portuguese State and the MSAR, so that there is greater flexibility to allow the Portuguese community to have greater accessibility to the right of residence, as existed before."
For the causal, "Misrere does not have to randomly assign more homes, but it is something that corresponds only to my desire." "Of course, that Mand has its reasons and Macau is different, and there are other communities that are interested in staying in the territory. The Portuguese community, due to greater historical connection that has to the territory, is still another community, among others. As Portuguese we are, we would like to have greater flexibility," he admitted.
The EPM case
Another point that Amelia António and Miguel de Senna Fernandes want to see approached on Paulo Rangel's visit is the situation at the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) and the lack of teachers. "I think you should see the school and make a little more awareness of the situation, although the EPM is not from its area. As a member of the government it is important to realize that this situation has been poorly conducted, because in Portugal has been gone after some conversations that have little to do with reality and only harm. If he realized a little more of the situation, it would not be bad," said Amelia António.
Already Miguel de Senna Fernandes says that it is time for the Portuguese executive to stop looking at the school as another Portuguese educational institution abroad. “EPM is always a recurring question, and it all depends on how the Portuguese state looks at school: if you look like any Portuguese school spread around the world, this is a mistake. There is no possible comparison, because the EPM emerged in a very special context.”
However, to Lusa agency, Jorge Neto Valente, president of the EPM foundation, was categorical: the school “has nothing to peddling” to Paulo Rangel. "There is no whimper, we have nothing to do, we have nothing to demand, everything is normal," he said.
The lawyer and president of the founding of the EPM said Rangel hoped "take a correct perception of the school, what it is for, the goals he has." “It's always good to have direct knowledge, it's much better than in papers,” said Neto Valente. "We have to account that the school is fulfilling the role that is expected to play," added the leader, recalling that the Portuguese State holds the majority of the capital of the EPM foundation.
Still on the EPM universe, Miguel de Senna Fernandes, who also leads the Macanese Instruction Promoting Association (Apim), suggested a close look at the Chinese teaching in the EPM.
"I have always advocated that Cantonese must have status. Because students, when they leave school, are in a singing world. This with all the merit that can have teaching in Mandarin," he said. "It is an issue that should be posed. It is a delicate question, because we are talking about an official language," he added, referring to Mandarin, an official language in China.
The official, also vice president of the EPM foundation, admits that this is not a question that generates consensus -"many parents do not agree with this view" -but stresses that the learning of Cantonese "is a vehicle of integration", as it is the dominant language in the territory.
Yes to the electronic vote
Also to Lusa several associative leaders defended the transition to electronic vote, stressing embarrassment in the current options for emigration. "As long as it is not advanced without being tested, I am fully in agreement. The future is this and we have to point out," said the president of the CPM.
In legislative elections, the Portuguese abroad have the possibility of exercising the right to vote in person or by post, while in presidential and European, the vote is in person.
In choosing correspondence, the government sends the address indicated in the census notebook the voting report and two envelopes, one of green and one white, which must be returned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs after filling.
The electronic option “can offer greater security”, defended Maria Amelia António. "With the consulates to work badly, in order to have few employees, with their work, and in countries where they are far from the places where people live, it is very difficult for people to vote personally. There has also been a lot of failures in the guarantees of receiving vote [via mail]," he added.
The electronic choice is a longstanding claim of the Portuguese Communities Council (CCP). Rui Marcelo, president of the Regional Council of the Portuguese Communities of Asia and Oceania, who has a meeting scheduled with the Portuguese Foreign Minister, said that the “theme is already part of the CCP agenda“ a few years ago and has been approached several times and with several governments ”.
"With the advancement of technology and the possibility of implementing security systems that can ensure vote safety - which happens today through the provision of services in other areas of the government also - the conditions are created so that we can eventually evolve into a situation where it can obviously be a complement, but not a substitute," he noticed.
In February, the Portuguese Parliament approved a resolution proposed by the PSD to test the electronic vote in emigration. The President of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, suggested in December a pilot electronic voting experience in the circles of emigration.
The head of Portuguese diplomacy arrives in Macau today after passing by Beijing and Haikou, in the province of Haião, where he was present at the Boao Forum.
In Macao, Paulo Rangel has scheduled meetings with the head of local government, Sam Hou Fai, as well as the counselors of the Portuguese communities, associative representatives, educational institutions and entrepreneurs. Visit the EPM and the Consulate General of Portugal in the territory.
In the late afternoon, MNE goes to Hong Kong to visit “Lusas Stories”, an exhibition dedicated to the Portuguese community at the Hong Kong History Museum.

At a press conference yesterday in Tokyo, during his state visit, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said that Brazil has "two decisions to make" in response to 25 percent rates that came into force this month: the first is to resort to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and, if it does not work, "resort to other tools".
Lula specifically mentioned the option of “increasing tariffs on American products” imported by Brazil, which defined as “putting into practice the law of reciprocity”. "What we can't do is be silent, thinking that only they can impose tariffs," he said.
"I am very concerned about US government policy because of these rates on all products from all countries," Lula told the press in Tokyo at the end of his visit when asked about the new 25 percent tariffs on all US imported cars from April 2, announced the day before Trump.
"I am concerned because free trade is being harmed, because multilateralism is being defeated, and I am concerned because the American president is not the sheriff of the world, he is only the president of the United States," said the Brazilian leader.
Instead of imposing “unilateral measures”, Lula considers that it would be more appropriate to “talk to other leaders” to reach a beneficial price policy agreement for all parties.
"Honestly, I don't know the benefit of increasing tariffs on the cars bought in Japan," said the Brazilian leader of Asian country, one of the most affected by new commercial measures in the United States, given the weight of his automotive industry.
"The only thing this is going to do is to make cars more expensive for US consumers and increase inflation," said Lula, who also pointed out the risk of higher prices leading to economic contraction.
Leaders according to
Lula arrived in Japan on Monday for a four-day state visit, which ended yesterday, before going to Vietname, where he is expected to meet Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, and Vietnamese President Luong Cuong.
In a summit held the day before Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, the two leaders agreed to launch joint decarbonization initiatives and reinforce commercial ties, with a future free trade agreement between the Asian country and Mercosur on the horizon and the current context of commercial war and climate negationism.
During the visit, the Brazilian president stressed the message that democracy, free trade and multilateralism are in danger worldwide in the face of increased protectionism, authoritarianism, and the “new cold war” between the United States and China.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Zhu Houcong (1507-67), Emperor Jiajing devoting a lot of his time to his own person, discovered the state's affairs, delegating them in the corrupt Yan Song (1480-1567) who, among other infamies, would have a recognized righteous man who denounced him in a memorial sent to the monarch where his resignation proposed.

Francisco Mannão competes again for president, Jorge Fão for the General Assembly and Daniel Mendonça to the Fiscal Council. Mannão suggests the creation of a “satellite city” only for the elderly and calls for pensions update
 
Increasing the elderly pensions would be "gold on blue." In the meantime, Francisco Mannão continues to fight for this and other flags designed to improve the lives of older residents, again leading the candidate list for the management of Apomac - Macao's retirees, retirees and pensioners association, which take place tomorrow.
The list is unique and the faces have little or nothing difference from previous years: Jorge Fão continues to lead the General Assembly, while Daniel Mendonça competes for the Fiscal Council. There is only one new name in the position of Member of the Fiscal Council.
"It is very difficult to find people available to do this volunteer work. Jorge and I would like to find someone who could replace us, because we are for a long time in this association. We are elderly, but we have energy. As long as we have strength on the legs to walk, we are walking and trying to do our best by Apomac," Francisco Mannhão told HM.
Jorge Fão highlights the fact that Apomac has been about to celebrate 25 years since the foundation, noting that there is, in fact, a leadership problem that if not solved can culminate in the disappearance of the association. "We are not seeing the emergence of another list of younger and younger people, so that we offer our services for another term and so on, as far as possible. There is a leading problem at Apomac and in other associations. The Apomac issue is more serious, because we have been standing for 24 years, we will celebrate in May."
Satellite city and pensions
In a list that will lead the association by 2028, the motto is “we are elderly but energetic”, reads in the action program.
At the first point, it is indicated that the team's objective is "to monitor the government's policy and the Macau Foundation, with a view to adjusting the needs of our action program throughout this three -year term." In addition, they intend to "provide the necessary support to members so that they can enjoy the benefits awarded by the Government of MSAR and other official entities."
One of the requests on the list to the government led by Sam Hou Fai is the increase in pensions, which is currently 3,740 patacas. It would be for the association would be the update to four thousand monthly patacas.
"It would be good for the government of MSar to pay the pension monthly to the elderly, the pecuniary compensation and the old age, instead of having to wait every three months to receive the pension for the elderly, seven months to receive the pecuniary compensation and ten months to receive old age. Hm.
Another idea left by Francisco Mannão is from the construction of a satellite city only for elderly dwellings, in what would be a larger project against residence for the elderly already built by the executive, in the area of ​​sand black.
"I liked the Government of MSA to build a satellite city for the elderly. I worry a lot because there are many living alone, and with the construction of this satellite city they no longer have problems of loneliness, and could live with each other, and can provide services common to all. The construction of high buildings is good, but for the elderly it is not that good," he defended.
Still, Mannão assures that being elderly in Macau is much easier than in Hong Kong. “Nowadays, in Macau, the elderly live quite well, because there are many social support attributed to this group of people.
Sufficient resources
Asked about the essential points to make Apomac a larger association, Francisco Mannhão says that “they have enough”, but lames the closure of the clinic where they were provided to the elderly health care.
"Of course we had the plan to be able to develop our headquarters more, but due to the lack of the allowance we had to end our clinic. In this context, we had a program to develop this area that had to be abandoned, and that would benefit our associates. We tried to organize more lectures about health, because the senior group needs to know more about disease and health affairs, something that can generate great concerns."
In political terms, Francisco Mannhão, who was even a candidate for deputy to the Legislative Assembly, says that Apomac is an advocate of the principle of “one country, two systems”, thought by Beijing to the regions of Macau and Hong Kong. "We agree with the national policy of 'a country, two systems', so that Macau can be a paradise for us. So far we have been quite well in Macau, we have no problems, but we would like this principle to continue."
A lot of bureaucracy
One of the services provided by Apomac goes through bureaucratic support to the elderly in communication with the General Retirement Caixa (CGA), in the case of former civil servants who receive the reform of Portugal, or the Macao Pension Fund.
"The communication with CGA has improved a little, but the bureaucratic part is still very difficult to deal with on the part of our associates. Not long ago one of our associates has waited more than three years for an amount of an amount that was improperly charged," said Francisco Mannão.
Jorge Fão, in turn, stressed that Apomac is also popular with non -partners, including from the Chinese community, to treat various issues, such as requests for subsidies or funeral -related paperwork.
Still looking at the Action program, Apomac's list also aims to “organize more sightseeing tours to mainland China, making known its culture and success of the country”, as well as the promotion of “more coexistence, so that members join periodically”. Much sought after by the dining service, since in Apomac some dishes of macanese gastronomy can be eaten, the list wants to "improve the management of the canteen whenever possible."
Asked if many elderly from Macau want to pass the renovation in China one day, at a time when regional integration is increasingly a reality, Francisco Mannão admits yes, although many “prefer to stay in the territory, as they have their life rooted here, being used to the uses and customs of Macao”. "The Government of MSA has been doing a lot of work so that they can join the great bay," he said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>BOAO FORUM | Ia, globalization and sustainability in discussion</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/26/forum-boao-ia-globalizacao-e-sustentabilidade-em-discussao/</link><description>Another edition of the Boao Forum began in Haião, where topics such as artificial intelligence, globalization, current economic issues and sustainable development will be discussed. The head of the Executive of Masters departs today for the event, whose theme is “Asia in the world in transformation: towards a shared future”
 
Posters to announce another edition of the Boao Forum can be seen everywhere in Haião, the Chinese island that hosts the International Forum promoted by Beijing to discuss, with other countries, issues of economic, commercial and cooperation at various levels.
The MSAR will be represented by an official delegation led by Sam Hou Fai, chief executive, who will be on the island between today and tomorrow. Liu Xianfa, commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the MSAR, continues to join the delegation of MSAR as a guest advisor.
The official delegation of the MSAR is also composed by the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP, and the chief executive chief of the cabinet, Chan Kak. During the absence of Sam Hou Fai, the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, will interim the functions of Chief Executive.
The Boa Goveal Forum for Asia 2025 ends on Friday and has as its theme “Asia in the world in transformation: Towards a shared future” [Asia in the Changing World: Tows a Shared Future], and, according to a statement released by the chief executive's office, focuses on four essential areas, one of them “rebuilding confidence and promoting cooperation in a rapid transformation world”.
Objectives are followed by "encouraging growth and rebalanced globalization for inclusive development" or "modeling the future and rapidly implementing the objectives of sustainable development to respond more effectively to global challenges." In turn, the fourth objective concerns a very current area: Artificial Intelligence (AI).
It is thus intended to “explore potentialities and intensify AI's application and governance for development motivated by innovation”.
According to the People's Daily Journal, this year are expected for more than two thousand participants from 60 countries and regions, being held 50 forums, or discussion groups, around the above objectives. 1,140 journalists are expected to coverage the event.
The forecasts of a forum
The main conferences of the Boao Forum include discussions about the Chinese and World Economy, namely in "High-Level dialogue: China's reform and economic predictions" and "construction of an open world economy: challenges and solutions." Following is “Improvement of the construction of digital capacity &amp; conforming the gap between digital”, as well as “unlock the great potential of regional free trade agreements”.
Among the remaining panels are also conversations about the potential of AI in "AI: how to ensure a balance between application and governance." Countries will also address the issue of global governance in the relationship with the United Nations (UN), in "high-level dialogue: global governance after the UN summit of the future."
But the discussion forums start with some predictions made in the report released in the context of the Boao Forum, entitled "Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress". One of the forecasts is that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the Asian continent should grow 4.5 percent this year, reported Xinhua. "Despite growing global economic uncertainty, Asia remains a key growth engine for the world economy," the report says.
In addition, in terms of parity of purchasing power, the Asia GDP ratio, within the world total, is expected to increase from a registration of 48.1 percent last year to 48.6 percent this year. In turn, the report describes that the general situation of employment and wages “is improving in Asia”, with an unemployment rate of 4.39 percent for this year, less than the global rate of 4.96 percent.
The Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress also highlights foreign investments in Asia, describing that China and Asean-Association of Southeast Asia nations "are the most appealing economies in Asia." In addition, it refers that the dependence on the internal and external foreign direct and external investment of Asian economies in the region itself reached 49.15 percent by 2023.
From the point of view of the bidirectional dependence of IDE in Asia, China continued to be the most dependent economy of the Asian IDE flows, followed by Indonesia, with its dependence rates over 80 percent and 75 percent, respectively.
The report also pointed out that China remains the center of global production value chains, and since 2017, global trade in intermediate goods has been more dependent on China than in North America.
In 2023, China's global dependence on intermediate goods was 16 percent compared to 15 percent to North America. The commercial friction caused by the United States in 2018 did not raise their position in the global value chains of the transforming industry, the report added.
Thus, the advance of Asia is also described in the level of emerging green technologies, since this is "driven by strong industrial capabilities and political support." Thus, the continent seems to be positioning itself "as a potential leader in advanced materials related to batteries or production of biodegradable plastics."
China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea dominate the Lithium Battery Battery Technology Global Supply Chain, a factor considered crucial for the electrification of transport, the report underlines. However, China is at the forefront of the expanding green hydrogen industry in Asia, being the region responsible for almost 70 percent of the worldwide capacity of hydrogen electrolisters, also reveals the same report.
An ecological island
According to an Xinhua report, Haião Island, which welcomes the Boao Forum, is “a pioneer in development with low carbon emissions”, namely the use of photovoltaic energy.
"On Dongyu Island, in Hainan province, southern China, the almost null carbon emissions demonstration zone is redefining harmony between humanity and nature-remodeling modern life through the integration of cutting-edge technology with sustainable development," he describes.
But there are more technological news, such as the use of "a simple QR code that unlocks a coffee carbon emissions experience, and where a robotic arm prepares coffee using clean energy." There is also the bet on recycling, as "an advanced recycling cube separates the materials, converting them into" carbon points ", which can be changed to ecological awards."
The area that welcomes the Boao Forum has a total area of ​​190 hectares, where a bet on “three key strategies” was made, namely the “renewal of ecological buildings, use of renewable energy and ecological transport”. The renewal of the zone for more sustainable bets will have begun in 2022, being proof of “how technological innovation and urban renewal can shape a future with low carbon emissions, paving the way for sustainable development, particularly in the tropical regions of the world,” says Xinhua.
Also according to the same report, "one of the main strengths of the area lies in energy production capacity", currently producing "about 32 million kWh of green electricity, almost double its search for 17 million kWh". In turn, "surplus energy is introduced into the network, contributing to an annual savings of 7 720 tons of negative carbon resources," he said to Xinhua Ouyang Qinglun, deputy director of the Cosco Shipping Boao Co. Department of Engineering.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>History | Lara Reis, Professor of Macao High School, remembered in Lisbon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/25/historia-lara-reis-professor-do-liceu-de-macau-recordado-em-lisboa/</link><description>The former teacher of the Macao High School Fernando Lara Reis was remembered in the “Spring Conferences”, from the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center, by historian Celina Veiga de Oliveira. A native of Leiria, Lara Reis fought in the 1st World War and lived on Avenida da República, in the villa that today houses the Macau Red Cross house
 
Fernando Lara Reis was born in 1892 and died in 1950. Throughout a life filled with historical events and testimonies, the natural man of Leiria was a military man and a teacher at Macao High School, eventually making the territory his home.
Lara Reis's life was recently remembered at the “Spring Conferences” of the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) by historian Celina Veiga de Oliveira, herself to her former teacher in the territory.
At the session, the historian, who won the 2024 Macao International Institute Identity Award (IIM), recalled the “Professor, meritorious, driver of the arts”, and owner of “unusual knowledge”.
“He was a native of Leiria and lived in Macao until his death. He attended Leiria High School, the Military College, then joined the Army School. In World War I was in Elvas, and then left to Angola in 1915 when he faced the German threat over Portuguese colonies in Africa. Observer-Aviator. ”
Lara Reis was never a pilot as she wanted, having dedicated much of her life to teaching and Macao. “In 1919, Lara Reis went to Macao High School. He took a long circum-gap trip, leaving Portugal from Lisbon, going to the United States of America, crossed the entire territory and then went to Japan, down to Hong Kong and even Macau. He was a teacher in Macao, drawing, handicrafts and gymnastics until the end of his life,” said Celina Veiga de Oliveira.
The historian took to the session some written testimonies left by other Macao figures who wrote about Lara Reis, namely Monsignor Manuel Teixeira in the book “Macao Lyceu”. He said he never found "no teacher who had served the High School with greater dedication."
“He was a rigorous methodical teacher, whose military formation was certainly not oblivious to these characteristics. What was truly standing out was his artistic vein, because Lara Reis was always concerned with ascertaining the aesthetic meaning of the students and opening their mental horizons. This at the time when Macau was a small town. that he organized and also exhibitions by Portuguese and foreign artists he sponsored, ”he recalled.
Celina Veiga de Oliveira also highlighted the words left by the writer Henrique de Senna Fernandes in an interview on "one of the greatest qualities of Lara Reis", which "besides rigor and discipline, was the consideration by the students, not distinguishing rich from the poor."
Professor Lara Reis was "a party prosecutor who served to obtain tuition fees for needy students," and "he is due to the initiative of the creation of the High School Association, of which he was the first president." This association organized in the former canhydrome “sports parties of the end of the year when students performed the most difficult exercises”.
Work done in Macau
The historian also highlighted “another aspect of dedication to territory” by Lara Reis. The Leiriense "participated in the First World War and this led him to interest all those who were incorporated into this conflict, having founded the League of the Great War fighters and had built in the cemetery of St. Miguel Archangel the monument where the bodies of combatants rest."
Moreover, "another facet of his personality was a taste for travel, because he had no family and thus left for the world." "I visited museums, art schools and photographed everything I saw, having created a estate with 32 volumes that is now a heritage of Leiria."
Celina Veiga de Oliveira did not forget the old “Sol Pente” villa, located in the middle-leaf zone, namely the Avenida da República, which was the house of Lara Reis, later donated to the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Macao to “an anti-cancer clinic that was the first institution of the genre in the Portuguese colonial space”. Today this villa serves as a house to the Red Cross of Macao, and on its walls you can find a stone with the following message: “In this building legacy by the Rotary Fernando Reis to the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Macao, it was installed at the initiative of the Rotary Club of Macao the first anti-cancer fighting center on April 15, 1951.”
“Change of Ares”
When Fernando Lara Reis goes to Macao, political times are troubled, with the political agitation to be lived in China after the fall of the Empire and the Republican Revolution of 1911.
"In the 1920s the nationalist shock waves lived in the Canton, which sometimes haunted the Portuguese enclave quiet, but never moved with everyday life. The Portuguese administration guaranteed a standard appearance, and the parties at Christmas, Chinese New Year, the religious festivities of the Catholic community and the Chinese population were habitual."
Celina Veiga de Oliveira recalled that in the late 1920s, Lara Reis decided to transfer to Goa, a trip that would only accentuate her belonging to Macau.
“In the late 1920s, he felt he was time to change his air and asked to be transferred to the Afonso de Albuquerque High School in Pangim, and was there between 1941 and 1945, taking the opportunity to know India, and met the whole country. Instead, with a graceful and already sick license, choosing Macau to be his last address, ”he recalled.
Celina Veiga de Oliveira recordou também as palavras de Orlando Cardoso, que no artigo “Macau e o Oriente na vida de Lara Reis” falou do homem que se deslumbrou com Macau “a partir do momento em que, às 8 horas da noite de 23 de Outubro de 1919, avistou pela primeira vez o Farol da Guia, um pouco antes de se instalar no ‘New Macao Hotel’ e sorver de sentidos atentos os sons, os cheiros e as luzes desta porta of an immeasurable and fantastic Asia that he would describe to exhaustion. ”
These Lara Reis testimonies are “in a remarkable set of travel books that lay virtually unexplored in all their research potentialities on the shelves of the Leiria District Archive”, and were investigated by Orlando Cardoso himself.
In the same article, this one refers to a text from the newspaper “News of Macau” of January 17, 1950, about Lara Kings: “The Auster and Worsen Teacher; the tenacious and thorough tourist; the military who fought and consecrated the memory of those who fell in the field of struggle; the honest and firm friend; the lovely and humorous companion; social celibate that, despite this, did not disdain any opportunity to undo its gallants, always kind and inconsequential to any palm with a face that in the goto ”.
Given the few studies that exist about Lara Reis and the estate he left, Celina Veiga de Oliveira left a suggestion: "May the CCCM get the detailed index of the Leiria Archive, so that the research is possible for any interested researchers."</description><pubDate>2025-03-25 00:57:07</pubDate></item><item><title>MNE | BIR OF PORTUGUESE AND EPM are topics to discuss with Paulo Rangel</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/mne-bir-de-portugueses-e-epm-sao-temas-a-discutir-com-paulo-rangel/</link><description>During the visit to Macao of Portuguese Foreign Minister, Amelia António and Miguel de Senna Fernandes want to discuss the end of access to BIR access by Portuguese. The president of the House of Portugal in Macau associates this article with the position of Lisbon in the issue of 5G
 
It is another visit of a Portuguese ruler to Macau, but Paulo Rangel's first as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the executive of Luis Montenegro, at a time when the country is preparing to go to votes in May after the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic.
After a journey through China, Paulo Rangel will meet with local associative leaders in order to perceive existing problems related to the Portuguese community.
At HM, Amelia António, president of the House of Portugal in Macau (CPM), argues that the difficulties of obtaining residence by Portuguese should be one of the pressing matters. “My expectation is not high. I would like the Minister, after visiting China, to say something friendly, as relationships have been very loose. I would like to see this relationship resumed as usual and also that we were not as followers of the positions of the European Union (EU) so fierce, because we have very special interests and we have a very large Portuguese community. of the EU, and this should not be lost sight of. ”
Amelia António highlights the position that Portugal adopted in the case of Rede 5G and Huawei, but also “the development that occurred in relation to the coming of Portuguese to Macau, subject to Blue Card”. “I have the feeling that everything comes following this EU policy against China. Portugal must have a position to safeguard these interests.”
Speaking to Lusa, the official made similar complaints. "We are here, we suffer the consequences of these relationships [between Portugal and China], good or bad. We had very close relations for a long time, which changed with Covid. I have not seen things again as they were, and I think it was important that Mr. Minister explains what is the position," he said that Portugal does not have to "align faithfully with everything in Europe and, above all,"
Before the pandemic, he recalled the official, there was “permanent communication” and “much exchange” between the Portuguese and Chinese authorities.
Today is noticeable a “hardening regarding the Portuguese” in macao immigration, Maria Amelia António declared, but not being able to affirm categorically whether the position is related to “this removal” between China and the West.
Macao authorities have not accepted new requests for residence in the territory for Portuguese for the “exercise of specialized technical functions”, allowing for justification of family reunion or previous connection to the territory.
Also Miguel de Senna Fernandes, lawyer and president of the Macanese Association, regrets the situation of the assignment of the BIR. "I would like the Government of the Portuguese Republic to take into account the Portuguese community in the territory, which faces some difficulties regarding the possibility of obtaining the residence. It is a topic that may be addressed between the Portuguese State and the MSAR, so that there is greater flexibility to allow the Portuguese community to have greater accessibility to the right of residence, as existed before."
For the causal, "Misrere does not have to randomly assign more homes, but it is something that corresponds only to my desire." "Of course, that Mand has its reasons and Macau is different, and there are other communities that are interested in staying in the territory. The Portuguese community, due to greater historical connection that has to the territory, is still another community, among others. As Portuguese we are, we would like to have greater flexibility," he admitted.
The EPM case
Another point that Amelia António and Miguel de Senna Fernandes want to see approached on Paulo Rangel's visit is the situation at the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) and the lack of teachers. "I think you should see the school and make a little more awareness of the situation, although the EPM is not from its area. As a member of the government it is important to realize that this situation has been poorly conducted, because in Portugal has been gone after some conversations that have little to do with reality and only harm. If he realized a little more of the situation, it would not be bad," said Amelia António.
Already Miguel de Senna Fernandes says that it is time for the Portuguese executive to stop looking at the school as another Portuguese educational institution abroad. “EPM is always a recurring question, and it all depends on how the Portuguese state looks at school: if you look like any Portuguese school spread around the world, this is a mistake. There is no possible comparison, because the EPM emerged in a very special context.”
However, to Lusa agency, Jorge Neto Valente, president of the EPM foundation, was categorical: the school “has nothing to peddling” to Paulo Rangel. "There is no whimper, we have nothing to do, we have nothing to demand, everything is normal," he said.
The lawyer and president of the founding of the EPM said Rangel hoped "take a correct perception of the school, what it is for, the goals he has." “It's always good to have direct knowledge, it's much better than in papers,” said Neto Valente. "We have to account that the school is fulfilling the role that is expected to play," added the leader, recalling that the Portuguese State holds the majority of the capital of the EPM foundation.
Still on the EPM universe, Miguel de Senna Fernandes, who also leads the Macanese Instruction Promoting Association (Apim), suggested a close look at the Chinese teaching in the EPM.
"I have always advocated that Cantonese must have status. Because students, when they leave school, are in a singing world. This with all the merit that can have teaching in Mandarin," he said. "It is an issue that should be posed. It is a delicate question, because we are talking about an official language," he added, referring to Mandarin, an official language in China.
The official, also vice president of the EPM foundation, admits that this is not a question that generates consensus -"many parents do not agree with this view" -but stresses that the learning of Cantonese "is a vehicle of integration", as it is the dominant language in the territory.
Yes to the electronic vote
Also to Lusa several associative leaders defended the transition to electronic vote, stressing embarrassment in the current options for emigration. "As long as it is not advanced without being tested, I am fully in agreement. The future is this and we have to point out," said the president of the CPM.
In legislative elections, the Portuguese abroad have the possibility of exercising the right to vote in person or by post, while in presidential and European, the vote is in person.
In choosing correspondence, the government sends the address indicated in the census notebook the voting report and two envelopes, one of green and one white, which must be returned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs after filling.
The electronic option “can offer greater security”, defended Maria Amelia António. "With the consulates to work badly, in order to have few employees, with their work, and in countries where they are far from the places where people live, it is very difficult for people to vote personally. There has also been a lot of failures in the guarantees of receiving vote [via mail]," he added.
The electronic choice is a longstanding claim of the Portuguese Communities Council (CCP). Rui Marcelo, president of the Regional Council of the Portuguese Communities of Asia and Oceania, who has a meeting scheduled with the Portuguese Foreign Minister, said that the “theme is already part of the CCP agenda“ a few years ago and has been approached several times and with several governments ”.
"With the advancement of technology and the possibility of implementing security systems that can ensure vote safety - which happens today through the provision of services in other areas of the government also - the conditions are created so that we can eventually evolve into a situation where it can obviously be a complement, but not a substitute," he noticed.
In February, the Portuguese Parliament approved a resolution proposed by the PSD to test the electronic vote in emigration. The President of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, suggested in December a pilot electronic voting experience in the circles of emigration.
The head of Portuguese diplomacy arrives in Macau today after passing by Beijing and Haikou, in the province of Haião, where he was present at the Boao Forum.
In Macao, Paulo Rangel has scheduled meetings with the head of local government, Sam Hou Fai, as well as the counselors of the Portuguese communities, associative representatives, educational institutions and entrepreneurs. Visit the EPM and the Consulate General of Portugal in the territory.
In the late afternoon, MNE goes to Hong Kong to visit “Lusas Stories”, an exhibition dedicated to the Portuguese community at the Hong Kong History Museum.

The theme was discussed last week at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center
 
The proposal of public hiring, currently under analysis in the specialty in the First Permanent Commission of the Legislative Assembly (AL), was one of the topics addressed in the “Spring Conferences”, at the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) last week. The author of the lecture, the lawyer and teacher Marco Caldeira, made praise for the diploma for his attempt to reform and innovation in many respects.
"Although not perfect, the bill under discussion is justified by the need to update legislation that was approved four decades ago. It is a proposal that seems to point in the good way, with an effort to codify the regime, promote transparency and competition and bet on digitization," said the professor at the University of Lisbon Law School (FDUL) to HM.
In addition, Marco Caldeira understands that the diploma, and the content proposed by the government, aims to "follow what are good practices adopted in Europe and the West in general."
"It is also very commendable that the proposal was prepared following a serious and participated procedure of public consultation, which gave the opportunity to economic operators and contracting entities to identify deficiencies in current legislation and make suggestions," added Marco Caldeira.
At the CCCM session, the FDUL professor also pointed out that the concern [demonstrated, in the diploma] with the competition and transparency of the procedures ”, as well as“ the focus on training in the use of databases, as well as the focus on centralization ”.
The teacher also understood that, in this bill, the Portuguese regime "can help, because the practice followed in Portugal, and legislative evolutions, have useful teachings that, with proper adaptations, can be transposed to Macao."
Positive points
In the presentation at CCCM, Marco Caldeira highlighted several positive aspects of the current law proposal, namely “the express determination of inapplicability to certain contracts”, or the fact that “fundamental principles of public hiring” are established.
It is also required with the new law “qualifications to candidates and competitors” of public tenders, and there is also “the clarification and standardization of the types of public hiring procedures”.
Thus, a “centralized hiring regime” is created, as well as regulating “award criteria” in competitions, and the creation of an exclusive website for the public hiring area is also foreseen.
Marco Caldeira also drew attention to the real need of this diploma, as public hiring was legislated with various diplomas, including two decrees of 1984 and 1985, which established, respectively, the expenditure regime with works and service acquisitions, and the process of acquisition of goods and services. Such diplomas were “undone of reality” of Macao, even though the 1984 decree was reviewed in 2021, the teacher considered.
Marco Caldeira also considered that the process of reviewing this diploma has been “lengthy”, as the public consultation took place between November 6, 2018 and January 4, 2019, and a later report was prepared, but the truth is that the proposal has been under analysis since December 2023, having been voted generally on January 11 last year.
What has to change
In the same session, the causal and university professor also highlighted the points already addressed by the first Standing Commission of AL regarding the necessary changes to legislate in the area of ​​public hiring. It was imposed “expressly consecrating fundamental legal principles, such as economy, efficiency and effectiveness, as well as publicity and transparency”, and there is also “a lack of regulation of public hiring policies”.
There was also the “need to promote transparency in public hiring procedures” and ensure “greater protection of loyal competition”. There was also “lack of rigorous and explicit regulation on the composition and operation of the proposals evaluation committees” submitted to a public tender, and there is “lack of explicit demands on the qualifications and capabilities of candidates and competitors in hiring procedures”.
Other gaps point to “insufficient regulation and transparency in the evaluation and adjudication procedures”, or “lack of explicit regulation on proposals presentation with an abnormally low price”. It was still necessary to “improve the sanctioning and inspection regime”, as well as bet on “regulation that promotes the development of electronic hiring”.
Says the executive
Looking at the justification of the law proposal, submitted by the Executive to AL, it is read that one of the great reasons for his presentation was even the legislative dispersion that was verified and the misfit over the current reality.
"The nuclear part of these diplomas was prepared in the mid-1980s, and has been in force for over 30 years. A significant part of the provisions of other legal diplomas already has an obvious divergence regarding the needs of Macao's current socioeconomic development, the efficiency of public administration management and the reinforcement of transparency and supervision," he reads.
According to the executive, "given that public hiring involves the use of the public purse, it is essential to review these regimes in order to meet the needs of the society of our day." Thus, in this law proposal, “the process and regime of expenses and acquisitions of goods and services” are regulated, with some provisions of a 1999 law, as “the provisions related to the public works contract regime have a high degree of specialization and are still effective”.
It is intended, with the new law of public hiring, to “guarantee justice, impartiality in the evaluation of proposals”, defining “expressly aid criteria and rigorously determining the rules of conduct of workers and members of the opening and evaluation of proposals” subjected to contest, so that “excerpt their functions impartially and entirely”.
Thus, it is foreseen that “contracting entities must adequately publicize the informative elements related to public hiring procedures”. They are “those related to the public tender, the clarifications provided, the rectification of documents, the extension of the deadline for the presentation of proposals, the causes for non -adjudication, the decision to annul the procedure and the award decision”.
In order to guarantee loyal competition, the government wants to ensure that all entities interested in participating in a competition have “the broader access” to all procedures, prohibiting “all acts, agreements or practices that can prevent, false or restrict competition”. Moreover, there is the “principle of impartiality”, which determines that “the program of procedures, book of charges or other documents, made by the contracting party, cannot contain any clause designed to favor or harm a particular interested party”.</description><pubDate>2025-03-24 02:18:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Aviation | Maria José de Freitas regrets removal of panels from the airport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/20/aviacao-maria-jose-de-freitas-lamenta-retirada-de-paineis-do-aeroporto/</link><description>The first attempts to establish in Macao airlines in the early twentieth century were approached by historian Célia Reis in the “Spring Conferences” of the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center. The architect Maria José de Freitas regretted the removal of panels from Macao International Airport that told this same story
 
Between the departure of the plane and the entrance to Macao International Airport (AIM) was a corridor that told the history of civil and military aviation from the territory of the early twentieth century. The project of this area of ​​the airport is by the studio of architect Maria José de Freitas, which regrets the removal of the panels and historical information that were installed in 2013.
The architect left this idea in an intervention after the presentation of historian Célia Reis about the history of civil and military aviation in Macao on Monday, on the occasion of the “Spring Conferences” that take place at the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in Lisbon.
“We decided to tell the story of Aviation in Macao in this corridor, with a great extent, although at the time there was little documentation about it. I discovered some information in a work by Luís Andrade de Sá. We collected texts and images and put it all on the walls of this corridor, and that was there for a while.”
"With a new direction [at AIM], I was asked how I could prove that all these events had happened. I had documentation in Portuguese, but I had nothing in Chinese and English, and at a time when I moved to Portugal on vacation, I saw, when I returned to Macau, who had removed all the information and images from this corridor. This story is unfortunate," he added.
The architect added that she would like the history of the early days of Aviation in Macao to be told in these same walls. "It would be important to realize where there is more information, so that they realize the history of aviation in Macao, which was a pioneer. There was, for example, an aviation hangar near the mud houses, and there are a series of references linked to the history of this land that should be made visible at the airport, in the rooms, for example. This story should be told and things should be placed in the right place," he said.
Ricou plans
Célia Reis, historian and teacher, is developing an investigation project around the early days of aviation in Macao and this was the theme that led to the “spring conferences” on Monday, with the session “Aviation and Air Navigation in Macao in the 1920s-a process of colonial innovation”.
Célia Reis spoke of a time when aviation began to be important to China for security reasons, and also begins to be thought to Macau. In this process, there is a personality whose name is important, a Hong Kong -born Frenchman: Charles William Ricou, a engineering and aviation pilot. From November 1919 the possibility of “establishing an air career between Macao, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Philippines, Java, India” began to equate, from November 1919, the possibility of Macaoi, Shanghai, Java, India, "contacting local government entities to obtain facilities and agreements.
Célia Reis explained that Ricou intended to form two airlines, the “Far East Aviation Company”, with “a much wider connection, reaching Manila”, and another to connect Macau, Hong Kong and Cantão, named “Macau Aerial Transport Company”.
This company "was constituted in Hong Kong, with a capital of $ 50,000, and had as founding partners personalities from Macau, such as Humberto de Avelar, Rodrigues dos Santos, Francisco Nolasco and Francisco da Silva". The historian also said in the presentation that the idea "was to complete the rest of the capital necessary with low value actions so that they could be bought by all [the inhabitants] in Macao."
"There is even the appeal of the company's board of directors for the Macanese to subscribe to capital, showing that the company was extremely important for the inhabitants of Macao, highlighting its patriotic value, of solidarity with progress," he added.
"Several voices demonstrated at that time that the company's commercial success, at first, could be little or none, although it was thought that the company could have some profits, having the ability to transport the air mail. However, this transportation capacity would be extremely limited, as the number of mail objects to transport from Macau was 24 letters a day," said Célia Reis.
At the time it was thought that Macau would be a pioneer, because "it would be the first territory the Early East to have an aviation company", something that would "bring more visitors and increase trade." The Government of Macao, then led by Governor Correia da Silva, "gives in to the company's appeals, granting various facilities, such as the permission to build a provisional hangar on public ground that was vacant or from sea access infrastructure." In addition, “exemption from payment of the fuel storage tax” was allowed.
Thus, Macao even had hydroavião and 21 American airmen hired by the company. "It was considered that it was the largest load of air material exported by the United States of America (USA), all brought to Macao." Then the company tries to organize itself, "even asking for space on Taipa Island, designed to have definitive hangars, although provisional concessions have existed." In this context, he recalled the historian, "there were subsidies, a contract for the transportation of postal bags", to "allow a development of air navigation."
Impasses to the end
In May 1920, a new worldwide aviation convention emerged, to which Portugal adheres, which causes the “Macau Aerial Transport Company” to be nationalized. The project comes to advance, but quickly retreats.
“The airline therefore accesses the condition of obtaining a subsidy, and having four aircraft available for military service in Macau, if necessary. The issue of defense was always present. There was then some disagreement between the conditions required by the company and those that the governor understood were necessary. In addition, the government of Macao needed the Lisbon authorization for the operation of the airline. Advance, and this one begins to negotiate with the company. But voices begin to emerge in Lisbon that will make things change. ”
This is the idea that the US would be showing hidden interests through the establishment of the company. "[In Lisbon] it is fear that this is the found form of an American aviation company to settle in Macao, Portuguese territory, by different ways."
First, Lisbon forbids, retreating in the negotiations, and the next governor, Rodrigo Rodrigues, "is not in accordance with the company, understanding that it will not be viable," which leads to the entire project and dialogue to be suspended.
Célia Reis also pointed out that "the government of Correia da Silva has undergone several difficulties in these years, in terms of security", having occurred "very serious incidents in the relationship between Portugal and China".
“For this reason, the governor considered that having airplanes was extremely important because, at this moment, China was also resorting to aviation. The authorities of Portugal, however, considered that the planes of Macao would be of no importance, comparing with the set of aircraft that would have China or even Japan. When permission for the constitution of the airline in Macao, Lisbon understands that the territory could have in a worrying situation and planes could have functions with planes Military, even if there were few, ”explained the historian. The project would fall, however, by land.</description><pubDate>2025-03-20 01:43:40</pubDate></item><item><title>The garden of Almerindo in Timor-Leste can be watered from Portugal or England</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/17/a-horta-de-almerindo-em-timor-leste-pode-ser-regada-de-portugal-ou-inglaterra/</link><description>The Garden of the Timorese Almerindo Fernandes in Lautém, 231 kilometers east from Dili, can be watered from Portugal or England, after the civil engineer applied new technologies to the agricultural sector.
Almerindo Fernandes, 30, has a degree in Civil Engineering and for years has worked on rural road construction projects, but the 'animal' for agriculture spoke louder and today owns Timor-Leste's first 'smart farm'.
In Lautém, Almerindo Fernandes has about two hectares of terrain, where he planted eggplant, tomatoes and other vegetables, which watering through an intelligent irrigation system that controls through a platform on his mobile phone.
"It means that in Portugal or England we can water the garden with the mobile phone. It's the modern world, the world of technology, digitization. It's the opportunity to use technology, using the mobile phone to water my garden," he told Lusa. "It is a great opportunity to use technology to modernize agricultural productions," he said.
With about 1.3 million inhabitants, the agricultural sector in Timor-Leste is vital to the economy of the country, but production is low and did not follow the growth of the population. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, more than 70% of the Timorese population lives in rural areas and most practice subsistence agriculture.
Almerindo Fernandes started the activity in 2017 with the money he was sparing while working as a civil engineer and today sells his production to the school lunch program, the Armed Forces and the markets of his municipality. “So far it was a private activity, but the government is supporting the expansion of the project to the other municipalities of the country,” explained Almerindo Fernandes.
The support was achieved after presenting the project to the vice-prime minister, coordinating minister of social affairs and Minister of Rural Development and Community Housing, Mariano Assanami Sabino, who eventually hired him as a specialized technician to bring the concept to the rest of the country.
“The government recognizes the creativity of young people and all citizens who have creative initiatives. It is a great opportunity and the government is supporting the transformation of the garden into a youth formation center,” explained Almerindo Fernandes.
In the garden, Almerindo Fernandes already has to work four people permanent and then hire others to plant, take the vegetables and do the maintenance, and at the same time gives training to young people who study agriculture.
Now, according to the civil engineer, the garden also serves to do experiences to improve the system, that is, to make it more efficient and effective, with “little spent and greater performance”. "It is the principle of modernization, increased production, minimal cost is the purpose of the intelligent garden system and it is a theory we have to adapt to Timor to develop the country," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 01:19:38</pubDate></item><item><title>MIECF | Deputy Minister guarantees that he stopped building coal centers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/miecf-vice-ministro-garante-que-parou-de-construir-centrais-a-carvao/</link><description>The Deputy Minister of Chinese Ecology and Environment, Sun Jinlong, announced yesterday that China has stopped building new coal centers, unlike in an academic report released in February.
“We completely interrupt the construction of new coal centers,” said Sun, during the opening ceremony of the Macao's International Environmental Cooperation (MIECF) forum.
The event began yesterday in Macao and will take place until tomorrow, with 26 companies from Portugal, Brazil and Timor-Leste, according to the organizer, the Institute for the Promotion of Trade and Investment of Macao. Sun Jinlong said in a speech that Macau, such as "the only region in the world that has Chinese and Portuguese as official languages," can play "a unique role in promoting financial cooperation and investment with Portuguese -speaking countries."
The deputy minister pointed out that China has already signed agreements with more than 40 countries to meet the impact of climate change. Charcoal production in China has increased constantly in recent years, from 3.9 billion tons in 2020 to 4.8 billion tons in 2024.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:09:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Medicine | More training vacancies for specialties</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/medicina-mais-vagas-de-formacao-para-especialidades/</link><description>The President of the Macao Medical Academy Specialties Council, Law Chin Ion, revealed that the entity is preparing the next phase of medical residency formations, and that there are plans to increase specialized doctors training vacancies.

The statements arise after being claimed that an elderly woman was invited to sign a list for the elections while exchanging the Macau Pass card, among other suspected cases
 
Electoral corruption is not limited to the exchange of interests and goods for votes, or benefits to readers. At this stage, the constitution of lists for legislative elections, "if any individual uses benefits to induce voters to sign the application for the event organizer, or the event organizer or who receives benefits commits the crime of electoral corruption."
The explanation was given by the commissioner's deputy against corruption, Wong Kim Fong, in a clarification session organized by the Legislative Assembly Commission of Electoral Assembly (Caeal) and the Commissioner Against Corruption (CCAC), on electoral procedures for legislative elections.
It is recalled that recently arisen that one of the elderly woman who was invited to sign a list for the elections while exchanging the Macau Pass card in an association to participate in the Grand Prix of Consumption. It was also alleged that school teachers would have been requested by associations to collect signatures to set up candidates and that a member of an association has been required to collect a minimum number of signatures. About this last allegation of pressure to collect signatures, the president of Caeal, Judge Seng Ioi Man, said on Wednesday night that the commission sought additional information, "but to date, no response was received"
Despite these suspicions, the president of Caeal revealed that by Tuesday no formal complaints had been filed.
Beyond borders
The CCAC representative also assured that arriving at the campaign phase, already with the lists defined, "will strictly fight illicit means, namely, fraud through threat, coercion related to employment, mistakes, violence, among others, to influence voter voting intention."
During the clarification session, in which about 220 people participated, the issue of supervision for campaign activities organized in Hengqin was raised. Seng Ioi Man indicated that violations of the electoral law outside Macao are also likely to be punished, not directly mentioning the deepened cooperation zone, in statements quoted by the Chinese channel of Radio Macau.
Through police and judicial cooperation, the president of Caeal refers to effective mechanisms to combat violations of the electoral law outside the territory of the MSAR.
Seng Ioi Man asked the population to denounce suspicions of electoral corruption or other irregularities, with “detailed and concrete information, including the form of direct personal contact”, so that Caeal and the law enforcement agencies focus efforts on tracking and investigating complaints.
It is recalled that the election campaign will take place between August 30 and September 12, and residents go to the polls on September 14 to choose the cast of deputies elected directly to the Legislative Assembly.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:07:12</pubDate></item><item><title>About 1,100 people live in apartments for the elderly</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/cerca-de-1-100-pessoas-vivem-em-apartamentos-para-idosos/</link><description>Until March 7, almost 1,100 people lived in the elderly buildings, a type of public housing that can be leased by residents over 65 years. The information was revealed by the Institute of Social Action (AMI), in the latest meeting of the Commission for Senior Citizen Affairs.
The commission gathered on Wednesday, and was attended by the secretary for social affairs and culture, LAM, which also heard that the 1,100 began to occupy the houses in the context of about 740 applications.
Regarding other people's requests to move to the apartment for the elderly, IAS representatives, including President How Wai, pointed out that they are dealing with the processes received between January last year and February 14 this year. The following work include the evaluation of the candidacies received and their ordering, also taking into account the capacity of the candidates. Only people considered independent can apply for this type of public housing. However, the number of applications that are being classified and organized has not been indicated.
Avoid isolation
At the meeting, the identification of hidden isolation cases was also defined as a priority work. This is a work that IAS expects to achieve through cooperation with “private institutions” and the improvement of “current services”.
On the other hand, the authorities promised to “learn about the housing situation of the elderly of Macao by conducting the 'inquiry to the beneficiaries of the elderly subsidy residing in the Masters' and 'increase extensive service teams abroad.' In this way, IAS believes it can “provide affection to hidden elderly” and provide them with necessary services and support.
The inquiry is in the preparation phase, and aims at the elderly, or couples of the elderly, who live alone and will be done through carrier visits, or requests for information with neighbors or commercial establishments.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:05:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Haião | Sam Hou Fai calls for reinforcement of cooperation with hengqin</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/hainao-sam-hou-fai-pede-reforco-da-cooperacao-com-hengqin/</link><description>The Chief Executive went through Haião to participate in the annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia 2025, and had a meeting with the Secretary of the Communist Party Provincial Committee of China, who suggested reinforcing cooperation between Haião and Hengqin
 
The Chief Executive requested the reinforcement of cooperation between the cooperation zone in Hengqin and the Haião Free Commerce Port. The proposal was presented to the Secretary of the Provincial Committee of Haião of the Communist Party of China and president of the Permanent Committee of the Provincial Popular Assembly, Feng Fei, at a meeting on Wednesday.
According to the official version of the meeting, Sam Hou Fai said he was "very happy to see the progress obtained by the creation of Haião's Free Commerce Port." The province that is located on an island is regularly regarded as Hawaii de China, and is one of the major Chinese tourism centers, as well as having a preferential regime at the level of tax payment.
During the meeting, Sam Hou Fai "underlined the deep and long time between the two regions", and "the good base of cooperation between the two parts in the sectors of tourism, health and education."
At the level of future partnerships, the Chief Executive said there is room to reinforce cooperation through Mountain Island, since "Hungqin's cooperation zone and Haião's free trade port have identical political aspects." The resemblance is not surprising, as the two zones are part of the interior jurisdiction. Sam stressed that these similarities can “enhance the […] unique advantages, widening the exchange of cooperation” between the regions “for mutual benefits”.
About Macao, Sam indicated that he is "accelerating with determination the impetus to the proper and diversified development of the economy" to achieve "high quality growth of society and the economy." Macao's government leader also said he was “an expectant of development opportunities through pragmatic cooperation between the two regions”.
Hengqin as a reference
In turn, Feng FEI indicated that the Haião Free Commerce Port will enter this year in operation as an autonomous customs zone and which was based on inspiration on the “several successful experiences of the Hengqin cooperation zone”. Feng FEI also pointed out that Haião will follow the development of the cooperation zone, to be inspired by the latest successes.
The ruler also acknowledged that "the structure of the industries of Haimão and Macao have common aspects, where the proportion of the tourist sector is higher, hoping that both deepen cooperation, reinforcing the union for a new chapter of cooperation in various areas between the two territories."
Sam Hou Fai was in Haião with a delegation from Macao to participate in the annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:04:27</pubDate></item><item><title>DSEDJ | Government wants young people to celebrate victory in the war against Japan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/27/dsedj-governo-quer-jovens-a-celebrar-vitoria-na-guerra-contra-o-japao/</link><description>The Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) wants to see the young people of Macao celebrating the “80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people's resistance against Japanese aggression and world victory against fascism” and, therefore, will fund various activities in schools.
The revelation was made by the vice president of the Youth Council, and director of DSEDJ, Kong Chi Meng, at the meeting that took place on Tuesday. The goal is to lead "young people and students to better understand the history of the resistance war and increase the feeling of belonging to the nation and love of the country."
According to the official statement of the meeting, financing fits the program for young people “looking for red roots” and has as recipients the local schools and associations.
The representatives of DSEDJ also framed the financing of activities in the “implementation of patriotic education with young people and students in different aspects and forms” in the “continuous enrichment of the work content of patriotic education” and the “comprehensive dissemination of the social fundamental value of love for the homeland and Macao through attractive means”.
At the meeting, the Secretary for Social and Culture Affairs and President of the Youth Council was also present, LAM, which warned the Youth Council that “patriotic education work must be developed more deepened, more detailed and more appropriate” in the future and that the hengqin cooperation zone should be used as a “exchange platform between young people from Macau and the interior”. Lam also linked that Xi Jinping pays close attention to the formation of Macao young people.</description><pubDate>2025-03-27 03:26:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Mountain Island | Complaints of obstacles to integration</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/27/ilha-da-montanha-queixas-de-obstaculos-a-integracao/</link><description>Long lines to cross the border, insufficient health services, non -recognized addresses and letters that never reach the destination. These are some of the problems of Macao residents in Hengqin, that Deputy Nick Lei expects the government to be able to resolve
 
Deputy Nick Lei states that there are many obstacles to ensure the integration of Macao residents in Hengqin, and asks authorities to take new measures to improve the situation.
Heard by the Citizen Journal, the deputy linked to the Fujian community indicated as one of the main obstacles the lack of conditions to cross the border, which makes those who live in Hengqin, but work or study in Macau has to often face long lines, especially during holidays or in the edge hours.
As a solution to this issue, the deputy proposes that Macao authorities coordinate with the hengqin customs to install automatic border calculations or inspection channels only for Macao residents, in order to increase the speed of border passage.
Regarding the identified problems, Nick Law also points out that the Health Center of the new Macao neighborhood of Hengqin, which began operating in November last year, has no regular blood harvesting service. Another of the identified flaws is the fact that some drugs available in Macao are not in Hengqin. Health services in the neighborhood for residents of Macau are thus considered insufficient. Law even reveals that there were residents who had to come to Macau to receive the necessary health treatments as they were not available in Hengqin.
Bureaucratic problems
In the list of complaints that appears in the statements made to the Citizen Journal, Nick Lei states that several residents find difficulties when they have to declare the address on Mountain Island with public services or financial institutions of Macao.
According to the deputy, it is often that Hungqin addresses are not accepted in local institutions as a resident recognized in Macao. Another frequent situation happens when the home on mountain island is recognized, but correspondence never reaches the destination. Law thus asks the authorities to ask the post office on the other side of the border to find a way to overcome this obstacle.
On the other hand, law regretted that the measure of the interior authorities so that the macao enrolled cars authorized to circulate in Hengqin could circulate throughout the Canton province has not yet come out of paper, although announced.
Nick Law understands that integration is a process that takes its time, but argues that these aspects should be improved quickly to attract more residents from Macau to Hengqin.</description><pubDate>2025-03-27 03:22:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Ambush</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/emboscada/</link><description>When danger lurks is the body that speaks. We are able to decipher in record time our powerful transmitters that we will never know exactly where they come from. The impressive accuracy capacity is perhaps the hallmark of thought to adjust to the unlikely, a genius network of components that add themselves before any analysis: we can designate as prescience, strong angle, innate talent to survive. However, it will always be supernatural, for nature does not need in its constancy of such tears, to live, after all, it is not even a great danger, but there are times.
Just as the behalf of life are open, also in our favor, resources are added, and in this succession we call miracle, this arithmetic that we must not ask too much so that it always constitutes its own atmosphere.
Cultural Europe of constant and almost legendary ramifications does not gather its daily life roles in the lives of nations, and has been in an offensive entertainment in these hosts, often from a difficult to interpret, and not to be east and west, to the center, or within its periphery. The dogmas launched fell asleep their cultural charm that no clairvoyance can already awaken, that a certain base hedonism has crossed everything so that no one else feels empty times in the many enthusiasts, and this begins as we are seeing, crumbling in various ways. Looking better (far forever any conspiracy theory, emphatic, superficial, delirious model…) when we only have a certain and incisive observation of events, we know that there is much more not revealed. There is now no analysis that overcomes René Char's great conclusion: "The dangers always come from an angle that we were not waiting."
For those who entertain in this amalgam of sudden changes, for those who are sheltering in the nations' head hat, which are unaware of the initial purpose is so great that they run the danger of an ambush. It's like the Silk Route, China brought a product that reaching Mediterrane, people of the desert and other Damascus roads, found, never seeing the real faces they made of a larger art. Mongolia climbed up there with some affinities with these nomadic tribes, and no one also concluded that this whole region below had not been in the domain of the great seda. More: that outside it pioneer. And now make our superlative friends who disdain Europe as who hides a slave? This, no one knows.
But after all, what would they want Europe? For nothing. The fact that we are being reduced in this way is already extremely perfidious even compared to that majestic Roman phrase "the gods drive those who want to lose". If we are thinking that we are of unquestionable attractiveness, the problem beyond pathetic, it will be still tragic, laughable. Ultimately, and not to saturate the world of strategies further, who tells us that they are human who represent the factors of these abrupt changes? Artificial intelligence may be much further, and never exclude extraterrestrial participation in the domains of the now.
In our personal lines things are no better either; We are full of ambushes, addictive, delusional complexities that such a old continent of people, and so atonitious in the face of its presumption, is now unable to react with the prerogatives that make any defensive organism. We are paralyzed. We go and saw at tea time, we squeezed our hands, future skeletons, and smiled as if we didn't want to understand anything else. However, we were only an ordinary market. Our modern condition is nothing more, and as we should calculate, the market is always very little. We shared the ordinary goods, deluded the war, made the sports frames of former armies, only none of this now matters, nor the atomic French incentive, that these defensive people must understand them only as an added danger. Zelensky is a Jewish struggle outside of a non -promised land, but there was a time when Crimea could have been his state. All this is over and it's over time, but we all behaved like a reality. China gently says nothing until we fall all inanimate in our words.
There is anything much wider than all these positions. When all begins to run away as a destination, we must have the circumspection that can make us understand this new modified world.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:32:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Artificial Intelligence in Macao Culinary</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/27/inteligencia-artificial-na-culinaria-de-macau-2/</link><description>(Continuation of the March 20 edition)
As the food industry adapts to new technologies, bosses take on new roles as curators of experiences rather than mere producers. The combination of human creativity with AI capabilities can lead to unparalleled gastronomic offers.
The impact of AI on consumer behavior cannot be ignored. The emergence of mobile applications that use AI algorithms to predict gastronomic preferences can change the way residents and tourists experience food in Macao. Food delivery services, such as FoodPanda and Uber Eats that do not yet operate in Macao, use AI to suggest restaurants based on users' habits and preferences.
This personalization increases customer satisfaction by presenting options that closely align with individual tastes. In addition, food sustainability is another critical area to which AI can contribute positively.
In Macao, like in other regions, there is increasing sensitization for the environmental impact of food production and waste. AI can optimize supply chain logistics, predict demand and reduce excesses, leading to more sustainable practices. For example, algorithms can analyze seasonal trends to suggest menus that align with available ingredients, reducing waste and ensuring that customers receive fresh offers.
Collaboration between food brands and AI development companies is also becoming predominant. Partnerships may arise with the aim of creating innovative culinary products that capitalize on AI data and knowledge.
For example, collaborations between chefs and technology companies can result in products designed specifically for Macanese cuisine, combining traditional recipes with AI -generated recommendations for the purchase and use of ingredients. The future of AI in the gastronomic landscape of Macau is promising. With continuous advances in automatic learning and data analysis, we can expect even greater AI integration into kitchens. For example, kitchen robots that may replicate the accuracy of human heads may become common.
These robots will be able to improve techniques such as cooking and precise emphasis, improving the consistency of food production. In addition, virtual reality and AI can join to revolutionize gastronomic experiences in Macao.
Imagine that customers can participate in virtual cooking classes guided by top chiefs, learning how to prepare traditional dishes while exploring the integration of Ia in real time. These experiences would promote culinary education, maintaining the essence of heritage. In the light of such advances, the ethical considerations surrounding AI in the culinary arts should also be carefully analyzed.
The question of the displacement of jobs due to automation is a pressing concern. As AI assumes tasks traditionally performed by humans, bosses and kitchen staff can see their functions evolve.
The formation and improvement of competences will become fundamental to ensure that cooking professionals can prosper in an IMI environments. Educational institutions in Macao must respond to this need, incorporating culinary technology courses in their curricula. This initiative will prepare aspiring bosses not only to dominate traditional cooking techniques, but also to understand the role of AI in modern kitchen.
By combining the traditional teaching of culinary arts with technology, the next generation of bosses can enjoy the best of both worlds. The use of AI in Macau cuisine means an important turning point in the way food is prepared, served and experienced.
By improving operational efficiency and customizing gastronomic experiences, AI brings a new era of culinary possibilities. Influential heads like André Chiang are leading the process, demonstrating how technology can coexist with tradition. However, the authenticity of Macanese cuisine should be preserved as we adopt these innovations.
By addressing this weighted integration, Macau can remain a vibrant gastronomic center, balancing the richness of his heritage with the exciting possibilities of the digital age.
The interaction between AI and traditional macao cuisine is a reflection of broader trends in the culinary arts globally. The trip of mixing the AI ​​with Macau's cultural heritage is just starting, but has a vast potential to shape the future of food. Resistance to embrace it can mean stagnation, while opening to innovation can lead to a prosperous and dynamic culinary scenario in the future.</description><pubDate>2025-03-27 03:53:47</pubDate></item><item><title>LIMITS OF WORK</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/25/limites-do-trabalho/</link><description>On March 17, the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department released data showing that approximately 12,900 people worked on digital food delivery platforms and other goods over the past year.
52.5 percent of these workers are between 15 and 39 years old, more than half are less than 40 and 24.2 percent over 50 years. 64.7 percent of respondents stated that this work is their main source of income, 61 percent receives less than $ 5,000 from Hong Kong (HKD) per month and 37.1 percent earns more than 15,000 hkd a month.
53.9 percent work less than 44 hours a week, 24.9 percent over 44 hours per week and 21.2 percent of these workers claim not to have a fixed time. 68.6 percent work only for a delivery platform every day.
91.3 percent of respondents say they have started working in this business because it is easy to enter, having a flexible working method and having great control over methods and procedures. 98.2 percent claim to have more maneuver field to balance work with personal life. 45 percent are attracted to this work due to salary.
Other data previously issued by the Hong Kong government show that the average salary of these workers was 22,000 USD between October and December 2024. By comparison, only 37.1 percent earn more than 15,000 USD, showing that they usually receive wages below average.
Office employees in Hong Kong usually work from 9am to 6pm during the week and another four hours on Saturdays, which means a total of 49 hours of weekly work. Excluding the break from an hour for lunch from Monday to Friday, exactly 44 hours. Since 53.9 percent of distributors work less than 44 hours per week, it is reasonable that their salaries will be lower than the market average.
98.2 percent of people who make deliveries say they do this service by giving them more room to balance their work with family life. This demonstrates that the new generation pay more attention to the balance between work and personal life, a different phenomenon from the “tele-work” that emerged during the epidemic. The “tele-work” means working from home because it is difficult to evaluate the limit between work and family life.  As people working on delivery platforms can control their working hours, the problem of defining the border between work and leisure is very small.
The three main limits that define the exercise of labor functions are psychological, temporal and physical. Psychological boundaries are rules created by individuals who determine specific thoughts, behaviors and emotions, which means that one should have a rational attitude when working and an emotional attitude when one is in family. Time limits mean defining working hours, turning off duties outside this time, and dedicating this extra labor time to home and family. The physical limit is defined by the workplace. When you go to the office you will work, when you leave the work ended. The statistical data of delivery platforms show that people choose to collaborate with them mainly because they have more room to control their hours and work model. This phenomenon indicates that the new generation values ​​the existence of boundaries to work time and, in terms of psychological limits, seeks to have more control over their work.
In the post-epicide era, it is given greater importance to the balance between professional and family career. Limits theory helps companies understand and better manage work and family boundaries, thus achieving better balance and allowing workers' quality of life to improve.
In Hong Kong, delivery platform distributors earn less. Although it has a better notion of the limits of work and a happier family life, material goods that can give to the family are limited. These workers need to achieve balance between family life and material goods. From a business point of view, giving workers more space and flexibility, as well as broader borders, will help recruit a new generation of employees.

Authorities have no hands to measure to investigate the causes of crimes, and in most cases investigators are perceived. There are people who kill or have their mates kill, allegedly, for love.
It is a transverse reality to all age groups and all social strata, which happens throughout the year. The passion crime happens by jealousy, revenge, a sense of possession brought to the extreme, or simply because the relationship has ended and cannot be lived without the presence of the other person - most of these passionate crimes are imputable being rare cases of unconsciousness due to pathological causes.
Those who decide to punish this way their companions or former companions always find a reason that legitimizes the death of the other. The murderer often happens, suicide next. The latest data point to an increase in marital homicide in Portugal in the last ten years. Worst of all is when passionate crime inserts the death of young children. There are psychologists who have not yet arranged full explanation that justifies how a father can kill a minor child.
Our arrests are full of criminals, but in prisons there is a very special "status" for the prisoners who have killed their mate or a child, as they will know later. This internal status is a justice for those who, even having committed another kind of crime, does not accept or admit to killing a child. The arrests of our country have been dozens of times in the various media. Or because they have more prisoners, without hygiene conditions, without food with the minimum of quality, with little recess, with the postponement of medical support, finally, a gap panoply that places Portugal on the tail of countries that do not fulfill human rights rules. The Portuguese prisons are a world apart, where it happens a little and even escapes so scandalous that they are international news. We recently had that Jewish Valley Escape, where five of the biggest detained criminals managed to escape while a vigilante ate a cream pastel…
By the way, with us a prison guard resides with us and one day I invited him to have a coffee. By chance, I drank the coffee but he drank six beers. All good. The conversation demonstrates well what is happening in the underworld of prisons.
So you now had an increase. Wasn't it bad?
Ah!… Do you think the increase in salary was something that solves the difficult life we ​​have? Don't even think.
And the risk allowance?
Look, I haven't received anything yet and from what I heard there in the prison of Monsanto, the risk allowance is a bullshit…
Tell me one thing: How was it possible that those dangerous criminals had managed to escape from the Jewish valley? And why weren't they in Monsanto?
Well, first I never realized how the worst of them was in my Monsanto prison and was transferred to Jewish Valley, where I had friends… Surely there was a lot of money…
To whom?
Well, that now I can't tell you, but the Lord certainly imagines that those who are in prison are not saints ... and that escape was very well prepared with the mobster support from abroad.
But, you prison guards are the reputation for being corrupt. To take the drug, to introduce mobile phones and other lethal objects…
Not quite. We cannot take a dry branch through the tree. Of course, I have colleagues who make good money from what they just said, but not all. And about the mobile phones and drugs, I can tell you that we have already caught women of prisoners who were visiting and had all this inside the vagina…
A mobile phone?
Exactly! Nothing special for some…
Another thing, do you run or not danger to life, or have a "agreement" with prisoners' heads?
We risk life if we make black life to prisoners. There are many who do not play in service, there are many who control the drug business through coded abroad messages, there are even mobsters who control life within arrests in all aspects and even control abroad activity. I give you an example: in prisons there is a certain “statute” among prisoners. These heads of the prisoners admit nothing to those who go to prison for killing the woman or a small son… Then we couldn't do anything, even if we put the children who killed their children… They arrange the way when the bath time treats them.
Do they take a beating?
Batcher? A lot and not only. They sticking them with a stick by the tail inside, oblige them to oral sex and whenever they can kill them…
And the news is not given to the family and the public?
Of course, the information is given. But always the same way.
As?
That the prisoner committed suicide ...
- And you, prison guards, silents…
Obviously. Do you have no family either? Are you realizing me?
Absolutely. I would like to ask him something else: there is a lot of homosexuality in prisons. Do you allow?
It is not a matter of allowing. This happens during the bath, in the cells with more than one inmate, in the work in the countryside and even in the libraries, especially oral sex.
Do you see any solution so that life in prisons can have more quality and more human rights?
I don't see. From now on it will always be worse because new arrests are not built, such as in the Nordic countries.
I thank this meeting and I can inform you that our conversation will be read in Macau, but be rested that your name does not exist. Thanks. I was pleased to know him better.</description><pubDate>2025-03-24 03:21:01</pubDate></item><item><title>SOAGAO | “Year 3” exhibition inaugurated today</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/amagao-exposicao-ano-3-inaugurada-hoje/</link><description>It is today inaugurated, at Galeria Amagao, at Artyzen Grand Lapa, a new collective exhibition that marks the third anniversary of the gallery.

Of the largest group, which used eight goldsmiths as a facade were arrested 33 people, seized 18 million dollars from Hong Kong. PJ estimates that the group, which has been operating since 2019, will have changed funds equivalent to 590 million Patacas
 
The Judicial Police (PJ) dismantled two criminal groups on Tuesday who were dedicated to changing Renminbis to Hong Kong dollars. The largest case, which was the focus of a PJ press conference yesterday, concerns a group that had been operating since 2019. Authorities have detained 33 people, 22 local and 11 residents of China, and seized about 18 million dollars from Hong Kong (HKD) in cash, some game sheets, 48 ​​electronic devices and 12 accounting and false transaction books that put the group's operations to the naked.
Since the beginning of the scheme, which began in 2019 with advanced capital by the group's head, will have earned more than 20 million patacas in illegal profits following the change of money in an approximately 590 million patacas.
According to details of the PJ investigation, quoted by the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, the group wore eight jewelery located in the vicinity of Casinos no Cotai as a facade to exchange money to play at the gambling tables. The scheme was to find gamblers, lead them to stores where they simulated the purchase of products, with the transactions recorded in fake taping of jewelery to hide the illegal money exchange.
In both directions
The PJ added that the group in addition to offering Hong Kong dollars after receiving the bank transfer from players, if they were lucky at the game tables could resort to false jewelery to switch back to renminbis via bank transfer.
Tuesday's operation mobilized about 80 criminal investigators, who separated among the various jewelery involved, as well as pledge houses, a office in a mall and several homes.
It was added yesterday that the group had a narrow connection with a clandestine bank in the North Zone of the Macao Peninsula, which collaborated in operations in the transfer and circulation of money, with a view to escaping the supervision of the authorities. The group's profits were found based on the variation of exchange rates. Authorities have indicated that they will continue to investigate the source and flow of the capital and seek suspects that have not been arrested now.
The PJ announced yesterday that it also dismantled another group of criminals dedicated to the same type of offense, which will have changed about 200 million HKD and found 1 million HKD in improper profits.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:17:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Borders | Car circulation increases 23.5%</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/fronteiras-circulacao-automovel-aumenta-235/</link><description>Data from the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) reveal that in February the car circulation was 783,129 vehicles, an increase of 23.5 percent in annual terms.

The Institute of Social Action (IAS) will cut the financing and recover the installed facilities and equipment of the Smart Nursery, operated by the Zonta Club of Macao Association. The information has recently been revealed, but is generating a wave of concern from parents, who fear for the future of children's education.
The reasons that led to the end of the support of the government of the daycare center were not made public. In explanations to Radio Macau's Chinese channel, IAS has stated that the end of financing is not related to any problem with the daycare operation. However, IAS indicated that it was not possible to reach an agreement with the Zonta Club of Macao Association on the molds in which the financing partnership would continue to function, which is in force until August this year.
The broadcaster also points out that IAS indicated that the lack of agreement aimed at “basic principle” and “important aspects of organization”, without further details, which was justified by the fact that the association could still bring the case to the courts of MSAR.
SECURITY TRANSFERS
While confirming the end of public funding for day care, IAS also assured the guardians to be available to help with children's transfers to other day care centers when the Smart nursery closes. The guardians were also informed about the outcome in question and the available options.
The IAS has linked that there are enough vacancies for all children who will have to be transferred, including the mud, where the Smart day care center is located. Currently, IAS reported, the day care centers more than 80 children and about half will enter into kindergartens in the new school year.
Despite the guarantees, during the Macao Forum program, several parents were concerned about having to transfer children in late August, when the closing is expected.
US connections
Smart is explored by the Macao Zonta Club Association, which according to the official portal of the day care center, has been an association linked to the international zone organization, since 2014. This is a non -profit organization founded in 1919 in the United States, which has as its mission the affirmation of women's professional role, through philanthropic, social and cultural initiatives. It has more than 30,000 members worldwide, between 1,200 associations in 67 countries and regions.
At Macao, he currently has president Christiana Ieong and has the support of businesswoman Pansy Ho, as an honorary partner.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:12:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Attack | Aggressor in psychological evaluation at the hospital</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/27/ataque-agressor-em-avaliacao-psicologica-no-hospital/</link><description>The man who attacked two people with a knife in a store in Travessa dos Anjos is indicted of the commission of attempted murder and severe offense to physical integrity. The information was revealed yesterday by the Judiciary Police, at a press conference, and cited by the newspaper or Mun.
The 41-year-old suspect is a resident of Macao and is currently at the Conde São Januário Hospital Center, where he will be evaluated, as he is suspected of suffering from mental problems.
According to the authorities, the man, unemployed and without a fixed residence, was inside and entered Macao at 1:30 pm on Tuesday, through Qingmao border. It was seen the wandering for several areas of the city, until it arrived at Rua do Campo, where at first it attacked a passerby with a Chapada, for no reason.
Once the first attack, the man moved to a supermarket and bought a knife to peel fruit, with a blade about nine centimeters.
Unimportant
With the knife, the man entered the telecommunications store at Travessa dos Anjos, where four employees, three men and one woman were.
Inside the store, without making him an anticipation, the man soon attacked one of the employees, who was struck in one of his arms. Another of the employees tried to prevent the attack, and was hit with a cut on the back of the neck that lasted for 18 centimeters to the back. Given the uncontrolled attack, the men eventually hid in a collection, which did not prevent the attacker from trying to persecute them. It was at this time that it dropped the knife.
Without the white weapon, he turned to the maid who tried to drag out the store. The woman asked people who passed on the street, unsuccessfully, while stores employees contacted the authorities.
When public security police officers arrived at the scene, they managed to control the man and, minutes later, to deliver him to the Judiciary Police. Employees told authorities that the attack began for no reason and that there was no discussion.
The employee with neck and back injuries, who even lost consciousness, was sewn with 100 points. However, the vital organs have not been hit, so a quiet recovery is expected, with no danger of life.</description><pubDate>2025-03-27 03:55:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

At a press conference yesterday in Tokyo, during his state visit, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said that Brazil has "two decisions to make" in response to 25 percent rates that came into force this month: the first is to resort to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and, if it does not work, "resort to other tools".
Lula specifically mentioned the option of “increasing tariffs on American products” imported by Brazil, which defined as “putting into practice the law of reciprocity”. "What we can't do is be silent, thinking that only they can impose tariffs," he said.
"I am very concerned about US government policy because of these rates on all products from all countries," Lula told the press in Tokyo at the end of his visit when asked about the new 25 percent tariffs on all US imported cars from April 2, announced the day before Trump.
"I am concerned because free trade is being harmed, because multilateralism is being defeated, and I am concerned because the American president is not the sheriff of the world, he is only the president of the United States," said the Brazilian leader.
Instead of imposing “unilateral measures”, Lula considers that it would be more appropriate to “talk to other leaders” to reach a beneficial price policy agreement for all parties.
"Honestly, I don't know the benefit of increasing tariffs on the cars bought in Japan," said the Brazilian leader of Asian country, one of the most affected by new commercial measures in the United States, given the weight of his automotive industry.
"The only thing this is going to do is to make cars more expensive for US consumers and increase inflation," said Lula, who also pointed out the risk of higher prices leading to economic contraction.
Leaders according to
Lula arrived in Japan on Monday for a four-day state visit, which ended yesterday, before going to Vietname, where he is expected to meet Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, and Vietnamese President Luong Cuong.
In a summit held the day before Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, the two leaders agreed to launch joint decarbonization initiatives and reinforce commercial ties, with a future free trade agreement between the Asian country and Mercosur on the horizon and the current context of commercial war and climate negationism.
During the visit, the Brazilian president stressed the message that democracy, free trade and multilateralism are in danger worldwide in the face of increased protectionism, authoritarianism, and the “new cold war” between the United States and China.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:33:17</pubDate></item><item><title>BOAO FORUM | Beijing asks Asian countries to oppose protectionism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/28/forum-boao-pequim-pede-aos-paises-asiaticos-que-se-oponham-ao-proteccionismo/</link><description>Chinese vice-master-master, Ding Xuexiang, yesterday asked “resolute opposition to protectionism” at the Forum dedicated to economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.
"Asia has become the world's most dynamic region in terms of development and growth potential," said Ding Xuexiang, vice-Chinese-prime minister, in his intervention at the event, which was attended by Portuguese Foreign Minister Paulo Rangel.
"Asia has actively opened its doors and took the initiative to integrate into the world," said the Chinese official, in a period of growing commercial frictions the United States and the rest of the world.
Ding Xuexiang stated that the region should “work together to protect free trade, adhere to open regionalism and resolutely oppose commercial and investment protectionism”. He appealed to the “resolution of differences and differences through dialogue and consultation” and defended “opening, cooperation and economic globalization” as “inevitable choices” for the region.
The deputy minister said China's economic performance “remains stable” and that “industry growth rates, consumption, investment and other indicators in the first two months of this year were higher than those last year”.
Ding said authorities “will implement more pro-active macroeconomic policies” and “expand internal demand on all fronts” at a time when weak domestic consumption raises deflationary pressures in the second largest economy in the world.
The leader added that the Chinese government will "promote the healthy development of real estate and scholarship more vigorously."

“More than ever, the current context requires a powerful frank-chinese partnership in the service of geopolitical stability, prosperity and the future of our planet,” said Barrot, visiting Beijing, before meeting his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.
The two ministers squeezed their hands on Diaoyutai's state -owned residence in front of the flags of both countries before keeping conversations on the door closed. Paris said the conversations would focus on the resolution of the Russian conflicts - Ukraine and the Middle East, and in commercial tensions between China and the European Union.
"The rhythm of the crises is accelerating," said the French minister, alongside Wang Yi. "Our two countries should therefore promote a stability dialogue that leads to solutions," he said.
"Given the political, economic and security challenges, a new Europe is emerging rapidly. Its only compass is strategic autonomy," said Jacques Barrot. "Europe will be particularly vigilant in defending its interests and values," he added. The minister also stressed that Paris and Beijing "must coordinate to promote just and lasting peace in Ukraine."
"China also has a role to play to convince Russia to sit at the negotiation table with serious proposals and in good faith," the French minister told the Chinese counterpart. Chinese diplomacy chief warned that "the international situation has changed again and will become even more chaotic."
France and China should “join multilateralism” and “work together for peace and development of the world,” Wang Yi insisted, who considers China one of the main targets of US President Donald Trump's commercial offensive.
"France opposes any form of commercial war and defends the dialogue on commercial issues, namely between the European Union and China," said Jean-Noël Barrot in Beijing.
Barrot also spoke of the sanctions applied by China to the French brandy, in response to the additional rates imposed by the European Union to Chinese electric cars. He claimed to be looking for a "quick solution" for this commercial difference, which allows both countries to focus "on building partnerships and investments for the future."
Under pressure
Jean-NOël Barrot is expected to keep conversations late in the afternoon with an unidentified senior Chinese employee. The French minister will then move to Shanghai, where he should inaugurate on Friday a hydrogen production factory built by the French group Air Liquide and participate in a Franco-chinian business forum.
Jacques Barrot's visit to China is part of a vast tour of Asia during which he visited Indonesia and Singapore.
The threat of Russian aggression in Europe "is not theoretical," Barrot said last Tuesday, from Singapore, after the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said on Sunday, which did not believe that eventuality.
Russia's “aggressiveness” “over the last three years has extended far beyond Ukraine itself,” Barrot told reporters.</description><pubDate>2025-03-28 00:23:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Tokyo | Japanese newspaper correspondent killed in Gaza</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/27/toquio-correspondente-de-jornal-japones-morto-em-gaza/</link><description>A Palestinian correspondent from the Japanese newspaper The Asahi Shimbun was killed in the Gaza Strip, apparently by an Israeli attack. According to the newspaper, Mohammed Mansour, 29, died in the city of Khan Youis, in southern Gaza, on Monday. It is believed to have been killed by an attack by an Israelite missile.
The newspaper initially told NHK that Mansour died with his wife and son still a baby, but then corrected the explanation, citing information that his wife and son were being treated in a hospital.
Mansour, a native of Gaza, began working for The Asahi Shimbun in 2023. The young journalist worked at Rafah and Khan Youis, sending reports and photos about the evolution of the situation in Gaza. The newspaper issued a statement expressing the inevitable feeling of deep sadness and anger at his death.
The publication emphasized that attacks on civilians, including journalists, can never be tolerated under any circumstances. Meanwhile, the Qatar-based Al Jazeera satellite TV station, said on Monday that one of its reporters was killed in another Israeli air strike in northern Gaza.

Paetongtarn, 38, who took office in August, was supported by 319 deputies, against 161, who voted against it, totaling 500 members of the Chamber of Representatives, the Baixa do Parliament
As planned, the leader was supported by the 11 parties of the government coalition, led by Puea Thai (Thai people), a platform linked to the Shinawatra clan. The motion was presented Monday by the Popular Party, in opposition, heir to the Avanzar party, dissolved last August by a controversial court decision.
During the two sessions preceding the vote, the debate turned around the poor performance of the Thai economy and the alleged influence of Thaksin, who ruled the country between 2021 and 2006, the year that was removed from power by a military coup.
Paetongtarn, a first-minister candidate for PUEA Thai in the May 2023 elections, reached the power in August 2024, after the then leader Srettha Thavisin, also from PEA Thai, was deprived by order of the Constitutional Court after appointing minister a corruption-convicted leader.
Do what I say
Thaksin, Thailand's most influential and polarizing politician in the last 20 years, has returned to the country after spending almost 15 years in exile the same day Srettha has taken office.
The former leader was arrested on arrival at Bangkok, accused of corruption, but did not pass a night in prison, having been transferred on the same day to a hospital, where he was six months old, and then placed in house arrest until his release, days after his daughter had risen to power.
Thaksin, 75, claims to be taken from politics, but occasionally admitted to advice to the current leader and was seen to preside over meetings with other prominent Thai political leaders. The Reform Party Advance won the May 2023 elections, but failed to rule due to a Senate veto, then composed of representatives linked to the extinct military council.
The party was eventually dissolved by the Constitutional Court, following an electoral promise to alter the laws that protect the Thai Royal House of criticism. PEA Thai, which initially allied with Advance, eventually agreed with a coalition government in which parties are associated with the military, once enemies of the Shinawatras.</description><pubDate>2025-03-27 03:49:42</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korea | Forest Fires have already made 24 dead</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/27/coreia-do-sul-fogos-florestais-ja-fizeram-24-mortos/</link><description>The fires that triggered last Friday are sowing the chaos through the Asian country.

The wind fires caused by the wind, which are among the worst in the history of South Korea, caused the death of 24 people, destroyed more than 200 structures and forced the evacuation of 27,000 people, according to the last balance.
The death toll included a pilot who died after a helicopter dropped during efforts to contain forest fires in the city of Uiseong in the Southeast, one of the hardest areas, according to the authorities.
The aircraft had no other crew. According to the National Fire Agency, at least 26 other people suffered varying degrees of injuries.
An old Buddhist temple, houses, factories and vehicles are among the structures destroyed in forest fires. South Korea's acting president Han Duck-Soo said the forest fires that began last Friday are causing worse damage than many other previous forest fires.
"The damage is increasing. We fear having forest fires damage we have never had before, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities to erase the fires by the end of this week," said Han.

Rangel stated that Portugal and China “have a long history of interaction” and that relations between the two countries “have been developing well,” reads the note widespread by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
Beijing and Lisbon “gave an example to the world” by solving the issue of Macao peacefully, he added. Quoted in the same statement, Wang Yi highlighted the “good tradition of respect and mutual support” between the two countries.

The city, located in eastern China, is considered a technological epicenter of the country, at a time when the artificial intelligence sector (IA) is having a new boom in the region.
The initiative is part of the Apple Mobile App Incubation Fund, a fund created to support the formation of entrepreneurial programmers and encourage the development of mobile applications in the iOS ecosystem.
Through this program, participants will receive technical training, mentoring and access to investors and experts from the sector.
"We believe that programming is a powerful tool that allows us to create, communicate and solve problems in totally new ways. We have the honor of deepening our collaboration from a decade with the University of Zhejiang to enable the next generation of programmers," said Cook.
According to Apple, the company has allocated 50 million Yuan to the university in the last ten years.
The mobile innovation contest, supported by Apple a decade ago, attracted more than 30,000 applications from nearly 1000 universities from “Greater China”.
In recent years, specific students have been added to students without prior program track and recent entrepreneurs (“Launch Track), simultaneously widening their reach to less developed regions in the country.
"We will work together with Apple to create a new generation of talents with integrity in terms of knowledge, skills, character and values," said Ren Shabo, secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at Zhejiang University.
Commitment and investment
Cook's visit to Hangzhou is part of his current tour of China, where he has reiterated Apple's commitment to the local market.
On Monday, in Beijing, he met Chinese Minister Wang Wenta, whom he reaffirmed plans to increase investment in investigation, supply chain and social responsibility in the country.
Cook made at least three trips to China last year to show his commitment to further increase the investment in the country and "take advantage of the opportunities offered by its opening."
In one of these visits he said he gives his Chinese partners "great value", without whom the manufacturer "could not do what he does," and on another trip opened the largest Apple store in Asia, located in the eastern megalopolis of Xangai. Greater China is Apple's third largest market after America and Europe.
However, iPhone sales have decreased in the region, partly due to increasing competition from local brands such as Huawei and the lack of AI functionality in the latest Californian company.

Is it difficult to legislate on the AI ​​at this preliminary phase?
Maybe we will never stop being at this stage. Notice, AI did not come up with ChatgPT or anything that looks like. Since the middle of the last century, and even before, but especially since Alan Turing's 'Paper' that Ia exists, first in the laboratory, girded with a group of researchers. Then it began to be released into the world and to be part of our lives, but never as now. We are currently in a kind of pandemic, where AI propagates in our existence as a virus, but not a bad virus, because I understand that the AI ​​often propagates with positive effects. Of course, although it is not a completely new thing, it is a very mysterious reality for us jurists. The problem begins that we can't even get a definition mostly accepted by experts of what AI is. First of all, we don't know what it is, because it is a moving entity that constantly changes. What we thought was ten years ago, today it will be an algorithm.
In the areas of private life defense, or personal data, for example, or copyright, what does European legislation tell us in concrete terms?
The AI ​​regulation [of the EU] is part of what we call “Data Package” [Data Package], it is inserted in the group of regulations that concern product security. But this is understood in very comprehensive terms, not only security as we are used to thinking about it, as something that calls into question physical integrity, but covers environmental issues, respect for fundamental values ​​and technology rights and data protection. It is true that the regulation has these practical aspirations and realization in some standards, but the idea is to develop with other existing regulations on data protection and intellectual property, and that does not conflict with them.
We currently have ChatgPT on the American side, and DeepSeek on the Chinese side. Do you think China positions itself as a leader in the AI ​​area?
China is found to be a colossus in the digital world. The way the world has been evolving has differentiated. 100 years ago we had war conflicts, and today we have wars where we continue to kill people, but we also have commercial wars and these technological wars. And I say that more than a war is a race to reach the new invention. The old blocks of countries have different strategies. For example, in the case of the United States of America (USA), this strategy has changed a lot with the presidency of Trump, but was always more liberal and "Laissez-Faire". This has also been the form of US action, but with Trump is more in the line of "Vale Tudo", what matters is to arrive first. There is a great promotion of technological companies, as you see with the great support they gave to Trump's presidential campaign. Then we have China, with a state policy, which is not so much in the hands of the private. There is a great focus on technological advancement, but it is visible that the country is already in a position that will hardly be achieved by others. Europe is not exactly well positioned.

Why?
Europe has made the decision that the best way to develop technological progress and foster innovation is through hyper-regulation. There is no centimeter that is not regulated or not being regulated by the EU. Of course, it may have some advantages, and the aspirations can be in the face of controlled and sustainable development, and respect our fundamental rights and the rule of law. But I have some doubts. First, that this is achieved, because the protection of fundamental rights does not go through this hyper-regulation either. Then it seems to me that we are doing this at the expense of a value that seems to me, which is innovation. This idea comes, by the way, in the report of Mario Draghi, who warned the EU to the ability to mortgage future generations because we are leaving innovation behind. I don't see that any of these three technological models [US, China and EU] be particularly fruitful because they have benefits and disadvantages. We have an interesting model, which is the British.
In what sense?
The United Kingdom maintains the legal framework it inherited from the EU, and has not yet changed it. The United Kingdom will not adopt AI regulation [Europe's Ai Act], because it is no longer part of the EU, it seems that it will not create such a regulatory framework, but have an approach that is having a very generic picture that fixes the main points and limits, but then there will be a sectoral regulation. This regulation, which is still being created, is to establish the 'guidelines' for each area of ​​activity, so that there is autonomy in each sector and always respecting the particularities of each. In theory, it is more interesting, but everything is at first and I have not seen cases applied in practice.
How do you comment on the use of AI in the legal and judicial area?
Using sources that are not desirable to do our work was not something that came with ChatgPT. Speaking of something I know well, such as academic theses or scientific papers, it is not unprecedented that some less scrupulous authors quote sources in which they have never put their eyes, and then quote the wrong way, or quote sources that do not exist. There are situations in which unafable sources are cited, such as blogs, or papers that have not been subject to the peer review system. This is not new. We have the chatgpt beside it helps a lot and the temptation is great. I don't think it's the end of the world. Literacy was fundamental to the academy and any citizen. We all have to understand the benefits of Generative AI and risks as well. Research on Wikipedia pages can also generate errors. It is impossible to tell students not to use chatgPT, because this ban would be hollow. I can't know how people do their job. There may be situations of scientific dishonesty and situations where information is not true, but if someone tells me who wrote something with ChatgPT support, I have no problem with that. I have if the person is considered to be the author's author. ChatgPT works a lot as a Google search, it's not completely new. But I have to realize that the information that ChatgPT gives me has to be very analyzed and again investigated. ChatgPT can only give me clues where I can go, and then it can be useful and make us think. It is a source like any other, but it is not very credible. Chatgpt never deals with things in detail, for example.</description><pubDate>2025-03-21 16:42:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Ruby Hui, President of the Macao Autism Association: “Autism differs from person to person”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/19/ruby-hui-presidente-da-associacao-de-autismo-de-macau-autismo-difere-de-pessoa-para-pessoa/</link><description>Created in 2012, the Macao Autism Association continues to fight for more care for children and young people with this development disturbance. But the association's president, Ruby Hui, warns of the need for more incisive policies for adolescents and their specific needs, especially in access to employment
 
 
What balance does the work done by the association in recent years?
My work is above all to establish a connection with all the entities and resources made available by the government and also the game industry, as the authorities have started to [the context of the new game concession contracts] that develop more social support activities. Therefore, we have gathered all these resources to organize recreational activities for children and youth. In addition, we organize therapy sessions for our members. Usually, we request financial support from private companies and the government, covering 30 to 50 percent of these expenses.
The support of the game sector is therefore quite important.
Yes, but it has not really been a great support. For example, the government covers part of our monthly expenses, about 40,000 patacas. But this amount comes only to hire two full -time employees and one part -time employee. They are the ones who organize all activities, deal with the bureaucratic part, which includes the presentation of many reports to the government, because we ask for subsidies for almost half of our expenses.
Therefore, do you consider that they need more support from the executive to be able to hire more professionals?
Yes, it would be ideal. Associations like ours are getting bigger and the children we support are growing. I would say that 60 percent of our members are 11 or more, and about 20 percent are even larger, over 14 years old. We have to think about their future and the needs of therapy and treatment for adolescents, as it is not only small kids who need therapies such as speech or occupational therapy. They are young people who are still in high school and need to acquire different types of social skills, boys need to know how to deal with girls and vice versa. Then, when they become adults, they need to know how to deal with bosses in jobs. There are many valences to explore, but at this moment I would say that the supports are not enough.
Are schools not yet prepared to receive these students, for example?
Autism may be different from person to person. Students with autism, but who have better learning skills, are in normal schools. But parents tell me that there are not enough teachers with certain skills to deal with and teach these children. There are teachers who still have a very traditional mindset to treat these young people, who often have to deal with alone with bullying, for example. I would say that there are many children and young people with autism with psychological problems because of the school.
When it speaks of the traditional mindset, what does this mean in concrete?
In the case of my son, for example, he is obliged to always be sitting at school, but often likes to move and get up from his chair. From the point of view of parents who have children with this problem, there would be no problem, as long as it did not bother others, but for teachers it cannot be, and complain. They say things of the genre: "He will beat the table, he will move the painting, makes a lot of noise." Every day I receive complaints from parents to connect with the school, and for small situations like this.
What are the main difficulties or challenges that Macao families face when they deal with an autistic child?
In my case, my family is middle class, and we are financially well. But when my son was younger needed to do therapy and it was very expensive. Now these therapies cost even more. At the time my son was in primary education, 600 to 700 patacas was paid for each therapy session, but there are days a father told me that the sessions now cost about 1000 patacas per class, which is very expensive. Families of lower social classes cannot afford. Therefore, this support is one of the great objectives of our association, raising money so that we can provide explanations, therapy sessions or other type of support. All so that our members can attend classes with 50 percent discount, where the association pays half the amount.
When the association was created, what were its main objectives?
In 2012 autism was not a very spoken theme. Therefore, we joined [some parents and families] and we started to ask for support from the government and try to draw attention to the subject. We got some things because the government now gives more support to these young people, at least for those under 12. The problem we feel is that these young people are growing and adolescents need other types of supports that do not exist.
What is necessary to change in mindsets and society in relation to autism?
In Macao there are not many companies willing to hire young people with autism. Situation that is not seen in Hong Kong, where there are several hiring programs with social companies. Macau needs to follow this path.
One day in Rio
World Autism Consciousness Day is celebrated on April 2 and, in this context, the Macao Autism Association joined Sands China for a series of activities with children and parents, which took place last March 10th. Through the program “Sands Care”, the game operator provided a visit to the exhibition “Coastal Fantasia”, with the figure of “King Lobster”, a creation of Philip Colbert artist ” A boat trip through the Delta of the Pearl River.
In total, 70 people participated. Quoted by a game operator statement, Ruby Hoi said the tour "allowed children to enjoy the maximum of the trip." "Thank you for all the support provided to people with autism in Macau, and I hope that all sectors of society can continue to support the development of these people and promote their inclusion in society," he said.
For the game operator, this type of events can help “reinforce the cohesion of families dealing with autism, but also promote the awareness of society and support for the community of people with autism fostering a more inclusive and supportive social environment”.</description><pubDate>2025-03-19 01:26:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Paul French, writer: Looking for Wallis Simpson in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/17/paul-french-escritor-a-procura-de-wallis-simpson-na-china/</link><description>The Rota das Letras literary festival, which starts on Friday, will feature the presence of writer Paul French, who launched last year a new biographical book, "Her Lotus Year", which describes Wallis Simpson's experience in China before being a Duchess of Windsor. The British author will also talk about “Destination Macau”, a nostalgic and almost cinematic account of the city's history
 
How did you come to the history of Wallis Simpson's life experience in China?
I lived in Shanghai for many years and many visitors knew that Wallis Simpson had spent time in the city. Rumors ran on what he had done, and visitors always wanted to know if the rumors were true, such as the idea that she had learned esoteric sexual techniques or had posed naked for photographs. It was also said that he had belonged to a group of opium smuggling, or a group of bets that combined horses races. For me, as an author and expert in foreign experiences in Shanghai in the first half of the twentieth century, none of this made sense. So I thought this was the ideal time to really find out what Wallis had done in China. The fact that she was in the country in 1924 and 1925, two of the most fascinating years in the history of modern China, helped a lot.
How do you describe the life of the duchess in the country during that specific political period?
China was in total chaos when she was there, because Puyi, the last emperor, had been expelled from the forbidden city and occurred the biggest strikes ever in Hong Kong history. In addition, political fractions were recorded in Guangzhou, warlords of war in Shanghai and northern China. These were also the most wet years that there is a record in China, with crop production breaks and the occurrence of tiphoid and cholera fever outbreaks. He fired the number of bandits and pirates. Then, in March 1925, Sun Yat-Sen, leader of the Republican Revolution of 1911, died without leaving an obvious successor. Wallis came across all this, as he was retained on the island of Shamian, Guangzhou, while the city struggled; In Shanghai, he saw corpses to be brought to the city from the battles of the warlords; He saw victims of typhus and anger in Tianjin; and troops of the warlords threatening Beijing. But he was also largely in a foreign protective bubble that protected her from foreign soldiers and her white skin. He could delight in China's culture and aesthetics, while around him the whole country threatened to explode.
How was the personality of Wallis Simpson, a controversial figure in the context of the marriage to the Duke of Windsor?
It is very important not to confuse Wallis of 1924 with the later Wallis, from the long years of exile and controversy as Duchess of Windsor. In 1924 Wallis was only 28 years old, fleeing from a physically abusive husband (her first husband, Win Spencer, an American Navy commander) and was not yet particularly sophisticated or cosmopolitan. These were characteristics that would learn in China, mingling in the “colonies” [concessions] international foreign and bohemiums of Shanghai and Beijing. In fact, it was in Beijing that it first mixed with ambassadors, high -level Chinese politicians, high -ranking military officers and a stretch, and from them learned everything from playing Bridge and enjoying Jade to how to behave in high society. Obviously, this was useful a decade later when he met the Prince of Wales in England. Admittedly, the posterior Wallis, the Duchess, is a more difficult figure to like. Perhaps she and the Duke have made some bad political decisions and made some friendships, perhaps Wallis became a little bitter for not being accepted by the British royal family. But the truth is that in 1924 she was young, free of a bad husband and was in one of the most fascinating countries in the world.
What can readers perceive this figure and about China of that time, with "Her Lotus Year"?
China in 1925 was on the brink of potential explosion, as the whole country could have fallen into total chaos, dividing into the size of Portugal managed by warlords with private armies, or a resurgent Qing Dynasty supported by Japan in the North [China], the South and, of course, the foreign powers-England, America, France and Japan-who had Chinese lands like colonies. Ultimately, this did not happen, but no one knew this in 1925. Wallis herself oscillated between feeling incredibly comfortable and happy in what was her "year of lotus," as he described him, quoting Homer's Sopoifers who never want to return home; and feel terrified of the violence of the warlords or those who were against foreigners.
What are the biggest challenges, as a writer, in the process of researching the history of Wallis?
Wallis probably became the most photographed and spoken woman in history, more than Marilyn Monroe, more than Queen Isabel II. But in 1924 she was not famous at all. So it left a very difficult trail to follow. He wrote his memories, but these were "disinfected." A big problem was also the rumors that the British government and secret services circulated in 1936 in an attempt to destroy the idea of ​​a marriage between King Eduardo VIII and Wallis. The attempt failed because he abdicated the throne and they married, but these sexual rumors and insinuations, many of them racist and misogynists, have remained to this day, and they continue to be regularly recycled in the British and American Tabloid Press. I found the real Wallis a much more friendly character than I expected, and I hope readers will feel that too.
Is invited to another edition of Rota das Letras. How do you feel for being part of the festival?
I love to be part of the Macao Literary Festival. Although he had spoken before in Macao, namely in the Portuguese bookstore and other places, he had never participated in the festival. I look forward to being able to talk about Wallis Simpson and also about my new collection of rehearsals about Macau, entitled "Destination Macau". Some stories of Macao that have pleased me over the years, some of them presented with a more English look, as it were, may be interested and will be new to the local public.
Book | “Destination Macau”, the city between “The Imaginary and the Real”
Paul French has just launched the third volume of the “Destination” collection, which had editions of Shanghai or Beijing, and is now dedicated to telling stories of the ancient macao, a “place as imaginary as real”, as described the synopsis of the work. The work of the British author presents "The Macao by artists George Chinnery and George Smirnoff, from Writers Deolinda da Conceição and Maurice Dekobra, to the fantasies of" Pulp Fiction "and febrile dreams of Josef von Sternberg and Jean Delannoy."
There is still no shortage of Paul French, stories around historical figures such as Pedro José Lobo and Ian Fleming, author and creator of James Bond. Macao of the time of World War II, those who “came to Macao in search of gold, and those who sought war refuge” is described, not forgetting “the combatants looking for a secret passage through the 'neutral' macao”.
Paul French unveil mysteries or tells forgotten stories to many, such as the idea that Japan had tried to buy Macau in 1934 or the person who sailed with the Macau pirates queen, Lai Choi San. There are, in all, 18 stories “true of fascinating people who lived or visited Macau in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries”.</description><pubDate>2025-03-17 00:38:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Augusto Nogueira, President of Artm: “Macau is ahead of Hong Kong”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/augusto-nogueira-presidente-da-artm-macau-esta-a-frente-de-hong-kong/</link><description>The Macao toxicode dependent rehabilitation association is 25 years old this year. Augusto Nogueira makes a positive balance of the fourth century that began with a small therapeutic community and reached international recognition. The Association's president argues that, in prevention, Macau is at the head of Hong Kong and that the use of synthetic drugs is not yet problematic in the territory
 
 
What balance does the work developed by ArtM in these 25 years?
We do the balance very positive, because we started with a small area and a small therapeutic community. Nowadays we have a community with a capacity of 60 people, much more than the 15 we had at the time. We have developed several programs, namely the syringe distribution, which is a success, because it has led to a reduction and almost suppression of HIV contagion by people who inject drugs. For nine years there is the program and we have zero cases of infection. We developed support for social integration and follow -up after treatment, with “After Care”. We do preventive work in schools with the “Be Cool” program. We have the project “Hold on To Hope”, betting on vocational education, through coffee and the art gallery. It is a project that is well achieved and that turns out to be turned to tourism. We have visits from international entities and various non-governmental organizations, and the United Nations themselves. The most positive for us is to know how many people are recovered and who are well today. Unfortunately, we could not recover all people, but in each relapse there is always the possibility of the person coming again to do treatment.
How many people have recovered in 25 years?
We couldn't get this notion. We maintain contact with many people, but others have already left Macau, followed their lives. We have some contacts in the first two years after treatment, but then life goes on. People also want to go on a lifetime with no connection with the artm, sometimes marry and new companions don't know about their previous life and want to keep some confidentiality. But sometimes we meet. The other day they paid me a water without me knowing (laughs). These are small gestures that give us satisfaction to continue and make us believe that recovery is always possible.
What are the big challenges to maintain the ArtM project in terms of space and financing?
In terms of space and places for treatment we are well. The facilities are ten years old, there are maintenance problems, but this is more related to the panorama of construction in Macao. We need a space for the After Care, because what we have currently rented and is deteriorated. We are talking to the Institute of Social Action (IAS) to have a new space. With regard to the back, all our departments have financing, but we obviously seek support for our activities otherwise.
Regarding the authorities' posture regarding consumption and treatment, do you understand that it is still conservative in relation to other countries and regions?
This question is a little ambiguous. In terms of treatment and strategy in combating consumption, I think Macau is very ahead of Hong Kong, for example. In Macao, we have therapeutic community, we work on prevention and treatment, as well as our syringes and methadone distribution program. We have a range of treatments available to those in need. In the area of ​​prevention, the government has given a lot of support. The IAS has been quite open in strategies to combat consumption and prevention. In Hong Kong, for example, there is no syringe distribution program. Macao is from the few regions of Southeast Asia that has a government -supported syringes distribution program. But there could be another different interpretation of the law, with a differentiation between what is trafficking and their own consumption. For example, at this time if the person has a higher amount than that stipulated is soon considered trafficking, without proof. We think that in this case there should be a differentiation. It is then up to the police to investigate whether the quantities found are for consumption or trafficking. There should be an opening to give people more opportunities to be referred for treatment instead of going to prison. But lately, there have not been as many cases as that.
How do you describe the current consumer profile in Macau?
There is a large reduction in heroin consumption, and the few people who did so consume it today, or sleep. At this time the highest consumption is metabetamin, cannabis and some ketamine residues. As for the new synthetic drugs, there have been some records, but so far nothing alarming. But of course we have to be alert, we have to continue to do a good prevention job so that people are aware of the problems related to drug use. Regarding trafficking, we know that before the pandemic there was much cocaine trafficking to Macao, and after Covid-19 this situation almost ceased to happen. A good dissuasive work has been done and has to continue to be done so that there is less traffic to pass through Macau. It does not mean that there are no situations currently, but we are not in such a chaotic situation as that.
Speaking of synthetic drugs and their consumption, which according to the latest United Nations report has reached a worrying situation around the world. What is your comment to the scenario described in the annual report of the International Narcotics Control Board?
It is evident that the use of this type of drugs has been increasing over the years. Synthetic drugs are a real problem in the United States of America, for example, with fentanyl consumption, and Asia in some countries. It is a global problem because consumption and production are easy. Some of these drugs are made with other chemicals and many other products that are not well known to the origin and that can cause many overdoses. The UN suggests combating the production of ingredients that are used to produce these drugs, continue to reinforce the investigation to catch traffickers. But there are points of this report that it is necessary to follow, for many countries, which is the struggle between ideologies.
In what sense?
There is a struggle between those who argue that harm reduction is sufficient to combat all these problems that are arising, and that it is the solution to everything. Then we have those who think that harm reduction is not missing. In the artm we consider that there has to be a balance, because prevention is something important that cannot stop. What happened in Portugal, for example, when they liberalized the drug and failed to prevent and support treatment, [it was not good], and today Portugal is again in a slightly chaotic situation at consumption and trafficking. This means that prevention can never cease to exist. There should be quality treatments, with supervision of entities. The speed of access to treatment has to exist, and it can not be like in some countries where people have been waiting for a vacancy or permission to enter, as non -governmental organizations do not let the person enter until they receive the subsidy for each bed and patient. In these months a lot can happen. Damage reduction should be seen as a continuity for recovery, with rooms for consumption with medical and technical support, or syringe management programs. There is another problem, especially in Europe, which is heroin consumers, when they reach a more advanced age, already have many health problems and need sites to be, of a certain dignity. We have been wasting a lot of time with these ideological wars, and some of them exist for the sake of power, to influence the liberalization of drugs, and this is quite harmful. People's rights end when it is beginning to harm the rights of all other people, there must be a balance. As the report also says, there is a lack of medicines for some countries in Africa.

Art
To commemorate the 25th anniversary, the artm inaugurated on Friday the “Exhibition of the 25th Anniversary of Artm”, which is evident in the Hold on To Hope Gallery until the 23rd of this month. In the cultural space in the village of Nossa Senhora in Ká-Hó, which is part of the Occupational Therapy Program for the Arts users, you can see an art show done by these, with 45 works of ceramic, painting and wooden works. According to a press release of the association, the exhibition “celebrates resilience, creativity and healing”. “Throughout the last quarter of century, the artm has been a symbol of hope for individuals on its journey of recovery of dependence.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Iame Asia finals of Karting back in December</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/finais-da-iame-asia-de-karting-voltam-em-dezembro/</link><description>The Macao Karting International Award will receive again, from December 11 to 14, the Iame Asian finals. Like last year, the coloane karting race will give invitations to the very coveted world end of Iame in 2026.
Organized by the Institute of Sport, Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), Otk Kart Asia and Iame Asia, the 2024 event brought back the international spirit to one of the largest competitions of the sport on the Asian continent. Coloane's karting received several races and different categories of Iame Series Asia, recovering the international prestige of an event that has been the scene of the Cik-Fia World Championship events.
Pilots from the interior of China, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Italy, France, Austria, the United States of America, Brazil, Hong Kong, and, of course, Macao, filled the track from the mashes in 2024 for four days of intense Competition, something that has not been seen for several years.
After the success of the previous edition, the formula is repeated this year. Singapore's organization again chooses Coloane's karting for its biggest event of the season, confirming the presence of the usual categories: Cadet, Junior, Senior and Master.
Thank you Macau!
The Iame (Italian American Motor Engineering) is one of the world's leading engine manufacturers for Karting. Founded in 1968 by Bruno Grana, the company is headquartered in Italy and is one of the references in Karting Internacional, having bet strongly in the Asian market in recent years. The presence in Macau is part of this strategy of growth and expansion.
The announcement of the return to the territory was made on social networks: “After an incredible debut in 2024, we are back with the Macao International International Award and the Iame Asia final for another epic confrontation! The city of emotions at high speed and legendary races will be the stage for the best pilots in Asia and the world!
Satisfied with the reception in 2024, Iame Asia organizers took the opportunity to leave a "huge thanks to AAMC and the Macao government for their continuous support and confidence to make it possible!"
In addition to the Macao test, the 2025 calendar of Iame Series Asia includes three events in Malaysia and three events in Thailand. However, for the first time, last weekend of March, the Iame Asia Cup will be held at the International Shanghai Circuit Karting.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 01:04:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Return to GIC | Local tests return to Zhaoqing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/regresso-ao-gic-provas-locais-voltam-a-zhaoqing/</link><description>The dates for the Macao of Tourism Car Championship (MTCs in the English acronym) were made known on the past Friday by the General Automóvel Association of Macau-China (AAMC) through a newsletter. The competition for local pilots and decides to find out the Macao Grand Prix in November will again return to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC).
After a year when the MTCS headed to the Zhuzhou International Circuit in Hunan province, AAMC listened to most of the territory pilots and chose to make these important races closer to the main interveners' house - the pilots. In recent years, the circuit of the surroundings of Zhaoqing has been the preferred stage for the realization of these races, due to the proximity and the fact that it serves as an operational basis to most teams.
The first of the two events scheduled for the 2025 MTCS is scheduled from 18 to 20 April, while the second round is scheduled from 16 to 18 May. The AAMC newsletter says that "all riders must go through a selection process before they can participate in the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix - Macau Touring Car Challenge."
Registration, for the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8), are open until March 29 and after the end of the registration period, "all applications will be subject to AAMC approval, which reserves the final right to accept or reject any registration."
The technical regulation was also published, as was officially confirmed the use of tires of the Italian brand Pirelli, which belongs to the Chinese conglomerate Sinochem, as had already happened on the last edition of the Macao Grand Prix.
Confirmation of the Great Bay
AAMC also confirmed the two findings for the GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4), which will be concomitant with the new Chinese Championship Sro GT Cup. The first race will be played from March 21 to 23, at the International Circuit of Shanghai, in the Formula 1 China Grand Prix. Zhuhai International. Also here Pirelli will be the only tire supplier.
These two tests will be determined for the big holiday party on the guide circuit, and it is defined that only 28 cars will be accepted on the starting grid in the mashed race. The 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix runs from November 13 to 16.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:17:32</pubDate></item><item><title>FIRST RALENT PROOF FOR THE MACAU GP took place in Shanghai</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/25/primeira-prova-de-apuramento-para-o-gp-macau-decorreu-em-xangai/</link><description>The first determination test for the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix took place last weekend at the International Shanghai Circuit. Integrated in the Formula 1 China Grand Prix Program, Chen Weian and Lichao Han won the two races that will serve to select competitors entitled to participate this year in the GT - Great Bay Cup -
 
A Taça GT – Corrida da Grande Baía passou a integrar a recém-criada SRO GT Cup, a mais recente competição de GT lançada no Interior da China, inspirada na prova para viaturas da classe GT4 do Grande Prémio de Macau. Trinta e três carros, seis deles conduzidos por pilotos de Macau, inscreveram-se para esta estreia – um número recorde de participantes numa prova da categoria GT4 na Ásia.
De acordo com o comunicado do organizador, o SRO Motorsports Group, “o número total de carros e a variedade de construtores superaram até mesmo as expectativas dos organizadores para um campeonato que só começou a ser discutido no final de novembro de 2024. Desde então, a equipa da SRO Asia e o seu parceiro AAMC (Associação Geral Automóvel de Macau-China) têm trabalhado incansavelmente para tornar a série uma realidade antes da sua estreia.”
The event started in a troubled way. Devido a um problema alfandegário que afectou vários carros, mais de uma dezena de concorrentes ficou impossibilitada de participar na sessão de treinos livres de sexta-feira. Felizmente, para este grupo de pilotos, entre os quais se incluíam os pilotos do território Kevin Leong Ian Veng, Kim Hou Lao e Un Hou Ip, os carros chegaram ao circuito a tempo da qualificação de sábado.
Animated races and decision in Zhuhai
With three dozen cars, from ten different brands, on track, all with very balanced tasks, was attended by two animated races in the imposing Shanghai track. In the first 12 -lap race, the two Lotus Emi GT4 Officials, by Daniel Lu and Luo Kailuo, who departed from the first line of the grill, were overcome on track by the Chen Weian Audi R8 LMS GT4. In the second match of the weekend, Lichao Han, behind the wheel of the same Toyota GR GT4 who beat the GT Cup - Great Bay Race in 2024, triumphed ahead of Chen Weian and Lotus de Liu Kai Shun.
Macao pilots had no easy life on a track where they had little or no experience. The most rewarded of all, Kelvin Leong, abandoned in the second round of the first race, while Miguel Law, in Audi R8 LMS GT4, was the best of the riders of MSAR, ending in 19th place. In Sunday's race, Leong took his BMW M4 GT4 F82 to 11th place.
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, at the end of the season, on the streets of Macau. The places will be attributed based on the classification after the second round of the championship, scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit, in a date yet to be announced.</description><pubDate>2025-03-25 01:20:30</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Fia introduces costly measure to GT world cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/21/gp-macau-fia-introduz-medida-onerosa-para-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) announced on Tuesday afternoon a technical measure for the GT3 cars participating in the GT World Cup of the Macao Grand Prix, which will certainly have an impact on a race that is the event's headlord
 
To improve the Balance of Performance (BOP) - the method that balances the progress between all cars in the GT3 category - the FIA ​​decided to force the use of torque sensors, like what you already do in their championships, such as resistance worlds (WEC) and Rally Raid or Formula E. Torque sensors offer a very high precision in power measurement, allowing FIA ensures that the power of each car does not exceed the values ​​assigned by BOP and that external factors, such as atmospheric conditions, do not influence performance.
Although Sro Motorsports Group is co-organizer of this race, and having a bop recognized worldwide, in the last two years, the Macao Bop has been provided by the FIA ​​itself. Last year, the FIA ​​BOP was worth a series of criticisms, with teams and pilots-particularly from Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, the main impaired-to publicly express their natural discontent with the difference in progress.
These sensors are installed in car transmission veins and represent the most effective tool for measuring wheel power, being individually attributed by the BOP process to each car model that participates in the world's most prestigious “sprint” race for GT3 class machines. According to FIA, the decision to make torque sensors mandatory after consultations with the brands involved in the GT3 technical working group.
Costs will shoot
For a race that has several private teams, this measure will be expensive, as these sensors exceed half a million patacas per car, and the teams need to have another same spare reserve system. This, given that most teams that participate in the MSar test do not use torque sensors in their cars in any competition, and cannot amortize the brutal investment.
"From the experience I had in Qatar, it is noted that there is a difference between several builders in the way it generates this technology. An extra support team is needed to monitor and maximize performance without exceeding the stipulated limits," he told HM Duarte Alves, the experienced track engineer in the territory who was with the official Ford team in the first WEC season in the Arab country.
"A good example is the difficulty and time needed for a builder who enters as a newcomer. An illustrative case is Mercedes-AMG, which is facing growth pains while developing its own systems," said Duarte Alves. “In more flat circuits, the management of these systems is simpler. In places like Macau, where 'torque peaks' will always be frequent, it will be a real challenge for the engineers of these systems!”
Confident
Immune to all this, the FIA ​​chooses a speech directed to builders, forgetting that most of the starting grid is made up of private competitors.
Lutz Leif Linden, chairman of the FIA ​​GT commission, said the institution that represents “made this decision in consultation with the builders”, adding that, to the international federation, “this means even more justice and improved control of BOP values, which is particularly important in such a prestigious and media event, in such a demanding circuit, where the long -speed straight lines contrast with tight curves and narrow ”.
Fabrice Van Ertvede, FIA speed technical manager, stressed the idea that "our goal, as a regulatory entity, is to ensure total equity for all participants." The implementation of torque sensors “is an extremely effective tool for achieving this goal, allowing us to align very different cars in parameters such as pure power, but also at full speed, a crucial factor in a circuit like the guide circuit.”
Despite the difficulties that Mercedes-AMG encountered with this system last month, Fabrice Van Ertvede praises that “the builders we hope to see in Macau this year are already familiar with this innovation, through their experience in the FIA's LMGT3 LMGT3 class, and the decision to adopt torque sensors resulted from the dialogue we kept with them.”
This is the second news that the FIA ​​introduces in the mashed race, having announced last month that the second qualification segment will have a super pole format, with each pilot to go to the track individually for a total of two qualification laps. The eighth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup will take place from November 13 to 16, as part of the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-03-21 17:11:10</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | FIA confirms GT World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/gp-macau-fia-confirma-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>The World Council of the FIA ​​last Wednesday confirmed the expected, that the eighth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup will be held as part of the Macao's 72nd Grand Program, from November 13 to 16. However, there is a big news for this year's edition
 
The International Federation, which co-organizes this race in partnership with Sro Motorsports Group and the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), took the opportunity to announce a new qualification model for the race. In addition to the 30 -minute qualification session equal to the previous editions (Q1), a second qualification segment (Q2) was added, reserved for the top ten pilots of the first session.
The Q2 session will be held in Super Pole format, with each pilot to go to the track individually for a total of two qualification turns, and each pilot is also allowed to use a new tire set at this session. This novelty will allow qualification to be decided without interference from third parties.
The remaining program of the Queen of GT will remain the same as the previous editions, with the free training session, the traditional 12-lap classification race on Saturday afternoon, followed by the 16-lap main race that will decide the world's Cup winner on Sunday.
Veterans compliments
These measures introduced by the FIA ​​were very well received by the most experienced GT riders. This is because traffic has always been a huge obstacle in obtaining a good qualification return on the guide circuit, something essential for those who aim to win this title.
"It's an excellent idea to introduce the Super Pole session in Macao," said German Maro Engel, the winner of the World Cup last edition by Mercedes-AMG. This will be one of the most spectacular and exciting sessions of the season and should also secure sports justice.
Raffaele Marciello, for two occasions winning of this trophy, and one of the BMW factory riders, also reacted positively, adding: “In Macao, it was always complicated to make a clean lap. With this new format, you will not hear the excuse of traffic or a red flag. Having only two laps will be very challenging, but now the fastest pilot will probably be in pole.”
This is an opinion shared by Laurens Vanthoor, the World Cup winner in 2016, who said there will no longer be “apologies” in the qualification. Porsche's experienced Belgian pilot believes that “there will be an added pressure because you only have these two turns”, because in a difficult circuit like this, “if you make an error, there is nothing more to follow. In a normal qualification, you have more opportunities. Personally, a shootout is always something that I appreciate a lot. For pilots, it will be almost the highlight of the weekend.”
And the younger ones too
Chinese pilot Yifei Ye premiered at the Grand Prix last November at the World Cup. Ferrari's official pilot, which is up to the Endurance Fia World Championship (WEC), has left a good impression on the guide circuit, and he also welcomes the measurements now introduced.
“It's good to eliminate these red flag interventions and yellow flags, so that in the end, the one that really is the fastest to get pole position,” said Yifei Ye that she could return to the race this year. "In Macao, everyone is very close in terms of times, so it will be extremely difficult for pilots to try to get to 'Super Pole'. I think it will also be great for viewers."</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 01:03:51</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Célio Alves Dias will continue to run this season</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/gp-celio-alves-dias-vai-continuar-a-correr-esta-temporada/</link><description>Macaense pilot Célio Alves Dias was one of the long -term returns of the 2024 car.
 
The Macao Cup winner of Macau in 2021 was removed from motorsport at the time of 2023 for personal reasons, but last year made his debut in the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8). Despite the vast experience in tests of the specialty, having conducted several generations of tourism cars, Célio Alves Dias had never managed the new bobbinns that the Macao-China General Association (AAMC) introduced in its competition in 2023. Last time turned out to be of learning, with some difficulties in the tuning and behavior of the Japanese car.
Participation in races at the Zhuzhou International Circuit and the Macau Grand Prix made Célio Alves Dias realize that his Toyota GR86 was not at the strongest competition level. Based on the conclusions drawn from these experiences, he decided to start preparing for the new season.
"The car had to be all dismantled. My car was bought in Monday, and the chassis and the security arc, for me, were not well done," explained Fu Lei Racing Team pilot to HM. "This, I made the car too hard and very difficult to bow. I tried a well -mounted China car, and there is a difference. I had a long time in January, in China, with this car. Our cars, made in the same workshop, were very hard, which made it difficult to get around quickly."
If in the Macao Grand Prix, the house riders, excellent guide circuit, managed to equate the progress to their hong Kong opponents and the interior of China, in the initial races on the Zhuzhou track in Hunan province, it wasn't quite like that. "There are many differences between cars, but especially in chassis, because the engines, in terms of power and horses, are almost all at the same level. Our opponents have also experienced many pieces, many engines, even speed boxes, and chassis. Competition cars are always the same.
Silver Jubilee in November
Being a usual Portuguese name in the Macao Grand Prix in recent decades, Célio Alves Dias debuted at the Guide Circuit in 2000 and from then was a frequent presence and no faults in the race until 2023. This year, its objective is to account for its twenty-fifth participation in the biggest sports event of RAEM, but will have to align in the findings.
While awaiting the announcement of the 2025 calendar by AAMC, Célio Alves Dias details details to start his test program, because his Toyota, after being reviewed, "is ready to test" in the interior of China, something that will happen "very soon," says the pilot.
In the last edition of the Grand Prix, Célio Alves Dias qualified in 12th place for the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. However, his participation was short and unhappy: at the wheel of Toyota with dorsal No. 11, was forced to give up after being immobilized on the climb of San Francisco. The Macanese pilot was out of the race on the first lap, in an incident that caused the Safety Car.</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:50:53</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
