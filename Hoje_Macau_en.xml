Sources cited by the agency indicated that the shipments have already been reserved for future dates and could be part of the “preliminary agreement” signed by Beijing and Washington last week, in Kuala Lumpur, in preparation for the high-level meeting scheduled for this Thursday, in South Korea. The acquisition could mark the resumption of soybean trade flows between the two countries, within the framework of a broader understanding between the two leaders, which includes the reversal of tariffs and restrictions imposed in recent months.
On Sunday, the US Treasury Secretary and head of the negotiating team, Scott Bessent, anticipated a strong return of Chinese purchases, guaranteeing that US farmers would be “extremely satisfied” with the terms of the agreement. Since Donald Trump reactivated the trade war with the imposition of tariffs in April, China has used soybeans as an instrument of pressure.
Despite Trump's calls “to quadruple” orders, China diversified suppliers, increasing imports from Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, investing in domestic production and even reducing the use of soybeans in livestock farming, according to consultancy Trivium.
The same consultant warned that Chinese leaders “have no interest” in returning to depend on the US for their food security and ruled out a “structural restart” of bilateral soybean trade. This month, state television CCTV indicated that the US could lose up to 16 million tonnes in exports to China if orders were not resumed by mid-November. “Losing China means losing half the market”, he pointed out.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:48:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Government | Wong Sio Chak visited public services</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/governo-wong-sio-chak-visitou-servicos-publicos/</link><description>Having recently taken office as Secretary for Administration and Justice, Wong Sio Chak recently visited several public services under his authority, in order to find out how they work.
Since October 16th, when he took office, he has visited the Directorate of Justice Affairs Services (DSAJ), the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM), the Directorate of Administration and Public Service Services (SAFP) and the Official Press (IO), “having exchanged opinions with management and leadership staff and frontline workers”, highlights an official note.
In the case of DSAJ, the visit took place on the 21st, with the secretary “taking note of the status of the work due to the merger of DSAJ with IO”, which will be formalized from this Friday. Another visit took place on Monday afternoon, with the government official, in the company of SAFP director Leong Weng In, and other leaders, visiting “the work offices of that service and meeting with management and leadership staff, to learn more about the work to promote Public Administration reform, matters relating to voter registration and public service on the front line of the Public Information Center”, among other tasks.
Wong Sio Chak left several notes on these visits, namely “the strengthening of unity and cooperation” between workers and the promotion of “horizontal and positive communication, in order to unite the team’s synergy”, and should also focus on “the reformist and innovative spirit and assuming its responsibilities”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:08:50</pubDate></item><item><title>PJ | Indicted for kidnapping and rape of lover</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/pj-indiciado-por-sequestro-e-violacao-de-amante/</link><description>The Judiciary Police (PJ) announced the arrest of a 34-year-old man on suspicion of kidnapping, rape and serious harm to the physical integrity of his lover. The case took place in a local hotel, after the two began an extramarital relationship last year.
According to the PJ's version, the man and woman are from the interior, where they met and began a romantic relationship. However, the most recent meeting in Macau ended with the alleged commission of several crimes. After a meeting in a restaurant on Saturday morning, the woman was blackmailed into going to the man's hotel room in Macau. If she refused, the lover threatened to reveal the relationship to her husband and his entire family.
The woman eventually gave in, but when she arrived at the hotel room she was raped and kidnapped for at least an hour. After the first attack, the woman contacted her sister to ask for help and ended up being attacked, with an ashtray on her head, in addition to being strangled with a cell phone charger cable.
Given his injuries, the man allowed the victim to contact his sister, who in turn alerted the police. The suspect ended up being detained by the authorities, and when questioned by the authorities he asserted his right to silence.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:45:44</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC | Debate on the “China-Brazil Puzzle” and the place of the Macao SAR</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/frc-debate-sobre-puzzle-china-brasil-e-lugar-da-raem/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) presents today, starting at 6:30 pm, another debate session integrated into the “Wheel of Ideas” cycle, with the theme “The China-Brazil Puzzle: Positioning Macau’s Strategic Piece”. According to a note from the FRC, the aim of this session is “to bring together key voices to address a crucial question: how can Macau’s unique ecosystem be harnessed to facilitate, reduce risk, and add tangible value to this vital economic corridor”.
Co-organized by FRC and Well Link Bank Macau, the conversation will feature four guests, namely Yuri Ribeiro, founder and CEO of “Valor da China”, a consultancy and market intelligence company exclusively dedicated to Brazil-China relations, cultural understanding and international business development, based in Guangzhou.
Another guest is Alexandre Lobo, vice-rector and professor at the University of São José in Macau, presented as a “Brazilian leader in innovation, with 20 years of global experience, and who combines deep knowledge in artificial intelligence and data science, with the passion for leading transformative projects”.
O leque de convidados completa-se com Felipe Ribeiro de Assis, advogado associado da PK Advogados, São Paulo, com um escritório full-service sediado no Brasil, onde coordena o “Chinese Desk”, e ainda Rodrigo Barbosa, co-fundador e director comercial da “Modular Park Brasil”, a representante exclusiva da Mussini no Brasil, especializada em construção metálica.

He was also vice-president of the Foundation for Science and Technology between 2019 and 2022.
Challenges and opportunities
Today's conversation addresses the current global panorama, where, in the “world of geopolitical and economic realignment, the China-Brazil relationship presents unprecedented opportunities and complex challenges”.
Therefore, “in this new scenario, Macau’s role needs to be re-examined and redefined”, he argues. In this round table, the aim is to “translate this dialogue into action, identifying real obstacles and mapping practical paths for the integration of services in Macau, transforming its latent potential into a concrete competitive advantage”, it is said.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:45:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Portuguese MP filed case against Rita Santos</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/eleicoes-mp-portugues-arquivou-caso-contra-rita-santos/</link><description>The information about the shelving of the investigation for electoral interference in the 2024 Legislatures in Portugal was provided by Canal Macau, which quotes Rita Santos herself. HM confirmed, however, the filing with the Public Ministry in Portugal
The Public Ministry (MP) will have archived the investigation targeting Rita Santos, related to the 2024 Legislative Elections in Portugal. The complaint came from some members of the Socialist Party (PS) in Macau, based on suspicions about electoral interference by the Portuguese Communities councilor. HM confirmed, however, the filing of the case with the MP.
According to Canal Macau, which cites Rita Santos, the investigation by the Portuguese MP was archived and the order containing the decision stated that “no evidence of irregularities was found” in the conduct of the target.
The order to close an investigation is issued when evidence is collected that no crime has occurred, or even if there has been a crime that was not committed by the subject of the investigation. The MP also orders the investigation to be closed if it has not been possible to obtain sufficient evidence to verify the crime or who was the perpetrator.
It was in March 2024 that information emerged that Rita Santos and the Macau Public Service Workers Association (ATFPM) were being investigated in Portugal. At the time, Portugal's National Elections Commission (CNE) revealed that it would forward complaints received about interference in Macau to the MP.
The complainants accused Rita Santos and ATFPM of having influenced voters to vote for the Democratic Alliance, the coalition that in 2024 was made up of the Social Democratic Party, CDS – Popular Party and Popular Monarchic Party and which won these elections with 28.83 percent of the votes.
Suspended mandate and local cooperation
Despite claiming to have been exonerated, the case had an impact on Rita Santos' political activity. At the beginning of October 2024, the advisor to the Portuguese Communities chose to suspend her mandate, with the newspaper Plataforma stating that the suspension was intended to avoid notification of the ongoing electoral fraud investigation. In turn, Rita Santos justified the suspension with the desire to dedicate herself to the elections for the Chief Executive in Macau, which took place on October 13, 2024, and the elections for the Legislative Assembly, which took place on September 14 of this year.
Until June of this year, ATFPM leaders, such as José Pereira Coutinho, guaranteed that Rita Santos would join the list competing with the legislative ones for the Legislative Assembly.
However, in June, Rita Santos was left out. The Macanese justified her absence with the fact that she wanted to dedicate more time to her family. However, the retreat came just a few days after the Macau Public Prosecutor's Office announced that Rita Santos had been questioned in the Macao SAR, due to a request for cooperation from the Portuguese authorities in the face of suspected irregularities during the elections.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:14:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Housing | Carlotta Bruni regrets lack of creativity in Zone A</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/habitacao-carlotta-bruni-lamenta-falta-de-criatividade-na-zona-a/</link><description>Architect Carlotta Bruni regrets that the public housing being built in Zone A of the New Landfills is not very creative. “What we see being built in Zone A are very repetitive projects, and this is a problem that has always existed in Macau.” Bruni speaks today about public housing at Casa Garden at another Docomomo Macau conference
Taking place today at Casa Garden, starting at 6:45 pm, is the conference “The advent of collective housing in the 20th century”, with architect Carlotta Bruni, an event promoted by the Docomomo Macau association.
At the Fundação Oriente headquarters in Macau, the topic of public housing and its urban functions will therefore be discussed. To HM, Carlotta Bruni regrets that the projects being built in Zone A of the New Landfills do not have the desired creativity.
Asked whether Macau is building too much public housing, the architect said “not too much, but we are building it poorly”. "It's the evil, the ugly in those buildings. It's a co-responsibility of whoever designed them and whoever commissioned them", he said, regretting that Macau had lost an opportunity to innovate in this area.
"The criticism I can make is the way these projects are developed. What we see now being built in Zone A are very repetitive projects, and the issue of having a repetitive project is a problem that has always existed in Macau. The fact that no one cares about having an ugly city", he highlighted.
For Carlotta Bruni, this ugliness aspect of housing “is something that is quite disturbing”, because “we, architects, have a mission in the world to make beautiful things, in addition to making practical, functional things that are cheap and all that”. “When looking at Zone A, currently, I honestly have to say that there was a bit of a mistake there,” he added.
“The two examples that I will discuss at the conference [Fai Chi Kei project and B10 building in Zone A] are a bit of a draw to the fact that social housing can be created in another way, with the same entities, but with more functions than the minimum indispensable.”
Living in a box
In today's talk, Carlotta Bruni “questions the spatial consequences of Macau's rapid urban densification, where the prioritization of gross built area led to the erosion of community space”, highlights a note about the conference.
In this way, the architect will “explore how architectural design can recover public and semi-public environments through the strategic placement of volumes, layered typologies and pedestrian connectivity”, highlighting “alternative spatial models that resist conventional categorization, such as open courtyards, narrow squares and elevated public areas, offering new structures for collective engagement in high-density contexts”.
Founder and director of the LBA Arquitectura &amp; Planeamento studio, Bruni will tackle some of the team's projects, namely the public housing development in Fai Chi Kei, now demolished. "Then we proposed public areas on all floors, because in Macau it is often forgotten that, when building a 30-story building, a certain detachment from the street is created. People feel that, when they leave the street, it is no longer part of their daily experience."
Carlotta Bruni regrets “the way social housing is designed in Macau, certainly with legal minimums in terms of space”. "We are designing very small apartments that then have no place where people can have a little more life. In the Fai Chi Kei building, there was, on every two floors, a very large space, with double height, so people could be outside, sit, do some exercise, for the children to meet up", he said. The Fai Chi Kei social housing neighborhood was designed by Manuel Vicente in 1977 and completed in 1981. Demolition took place in 2010.
The LBA Architect &amp; Planning studio designed the B10 social housing building in Zone A, whose construction has already been completed. There, too, the option was to create “a series of hanging gardens, with a varied location throughout the building”, creating “specific situations for each floor”, in order to build “small communities”.
The official also defended to HM that there is “a certain lack of planning” in the context of the Greater Bay Area, or at least “planning requirements”. “It is up to architects to worry about creating buildings with more interesting urban interfaces, we have to make an effort to create a more dynamic and interesting city”, he pointed out.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:11:23</pubDate></item><item><title>HK / Elections | John Lee praises Macau model and promises to follow it</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/hk-eleicoes-john-lee-elogia-modelo-de-macau-e-promete-segui-lo/</link><description>The Chief Executive of the neighboring region confirmed that he sent representatives to Macau to learn from the experience of the September Legislatures. John Lee also confirmed that he sent letters to civil servants indicating that voting is a proof of loyalty to the Basic Law and the HKSAR
The Chief Executive of Hong Kong promised to follow the Macau model in the next elections for the Legislative Council. John Lee praised the measures in Macau, where public servants were warned that abstention in Legislatures could be understood as a lack of patriotism, and some heads of Public Administration departments prepared questionnaires about their subordinates' voting intentions.
“I have already asked all public services to take all possible measures so that employees who need to work on voting day can travel to the polling stations in a convenient way,” said the leader of the Hong Kong Government. Like Sam Hou Fai, John Lee admitted that he also sent a letter to civil servants indicating that participation in the elections is taken as proof of loyalty to the Basic Law and the HKSAR.
Unlike what happened in Macau, at first, John Lee's letter was publicly released. In the letter, the Chief Executive indicates that public servants need to be an example of civic responsibility, which they should do when voting. However, John Lee did not clarify, similar to what happened in Macau, whether he will penalize public servants who choose not to go to the polls.
Messages to companies
The leader of the Hong Kong Government also publicly acknowledged that as a way of preparing the Legislatures, several representatives of his Government were in Macau, where they met with local government officials, to learn about the model. John Lee gave a very positive assessment of this exchange, which he explained by considering that the elections in the Macao SAR were “carried out successfully”.
However, the HKSAR Government's efforts do not stop at just mobilizing public servants. As happened in Macau, where some concessionaires and state-owned companies questioned workers about their intention to vote and arranged transport, in Hong Kong it is intended that private companies will also mobilize workers. “I also appeal to all private and public entities, organizations and companies to encourage their employees to vote, with appropriate measures”, can be read in the letter made public.
Despite this plan, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong did not set a target for voter participation. "We don't have any rigid indicators, but we will do our best. That's our indicator", said John Lee. In the Macau Legislature, the participation rate was 53.35 percent, the third lowest since the transition of sovereignty.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:01:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Labor Rights | Leong Pou U debuts with orders</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/direitos-laborais-leong-pou-u-estreia-se-com-pedidos/</link><description>Deputy Leong Pou U made his debut in the Chamber calling on the Executive to update several labor rights, which have not undergone any changes for more than 30 years.
“In reality, Macau's labor standards are always behind those of neighboring countries and regions, despite having a socioeconomic development similar to that of Macau, [...] and some labor standards have not been updated for decades”, began by stating the deputy linked to the Operários. “For example, working hours and annual holidays have not been changed since 1984, that is, 41 years; mandatory holidays have not been adjusted for 36 years, since 1989”, he pointed out.
Based on these data, the deputy elected indirectly called on the Executive to move forward as quickly as possible with the “systematic review and improvement of labor laws and regulations, taking into account the real situation and the development trend of the Macau labor market”.
Despite this request, Leong Pou U defended the need for a consensus between employers and workers to implement changes, which rarely happens, even within the Permanent Council for Social Concertation (CPCS).</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>AL | Leaders of work committees defined</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/al-definidas-liderancas-das-comissoes-de-trabalho/</link><description>José Chui Sai Peng will assume the presidency of the Rules and Mandates Committee, one of the most important committees. The Portuguese José Pereira Coutinho is the most experienced and oldest deputy and was the “king of votes” in direct suffrage, but he was not chosen for any leadership position
On Tuesday, deputies chose the compositions and presidencies of the Legislative Assembly's working committees. Legislator and businessman José Chui Sai Peng will assume the presidency of the Rules and Mandates Committee, which is particularly important as it has the power to suggest changes to the legislative body's operating rules.
For the cousin of the former Chief Executive, Fernando Chui Sai On, the presidency of a committee is nothing new, given that in the previous Legislature he led the Monitoring Committee for Public Land and Concessions Affairs. In relation to the secretary of the Rules and Mandates Committee, the choice of deputies fell on the lawyer and academic Iau Teng Pio.
With regard to the permanent work committees, the 1st Committee will be led by Wong Kit Cheng, a nurse by training and Women's deputy. The secretary will be Nick Lei Leong Wong. Wong also has experience in leading committee work, as in the previous Legislature he led the Monitoring Committee for Public Finance Matters.
In the 2nd Commission, the presidency was handed over to Ip Sio Kai, vice-president of the Bank of China (Macau), while the vice-presidency went to Lam Lon Wai, from the Workers' Party. In the 3rd Commission, the person chosen for president was Leong Sun Iok, also a Workers' deputy, while the secretary will be Leong Hong Sai, linked to the Residents.
Lots of follow-up
As for the monitoring committees, they also underwent several changes. In the Monitoring Committee for Land Affairs and Public Concessions, the presidency was attributed to Ella Lei Cheng I. In the previous Legislature, the Workers' deputy was the president of the 1st Permanent Committee. The secretary will be Joey Lao Chi Ngai, returned to the hemicycle, after being passed over as a legislator appointed by the Chief Executive by Ho Iat Seng.
In the Monitoring Committee for Public Finance Affairs, Song Pek Kei will assume the presidency, while Ngan Iek Hang will serve as vice president. Finally, at the level of the Monitoring Committee for Public Administration Affairs, businessman Ma Chi Seng will be responsible for the presidency, with Kou Kam Fai as secretary.
The presidency of the Administrative Council of the Legislative Assembly, which deals with matters such as the hemicycle's budget, was handed over to Ângela Leong On Kei. The committees' choices also confirm that José Pereira Coutinho was excluded from any leadership position despite being the most experienced deputy in the hemicycle, the oldest and also the one who was the “king of votes” in direct suffrage.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 01:42:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Commerce | China resumes purchases of US soybeans</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/comercio-china-retoma-compras-de-soja-dos-eua/</link><description>This week, China purchased two shipments of soybeans from the United States, the first of the current harvest, after months of suspension due to tariffs, Bloomberg reported yesterday, on the eve of the meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump.

According to Porto Editora, which published the novel “O Filho de Mil Homens”, the release date of the feature film was advanced by the streaming platform. The film had its official screening this Monday, at the 49th International Film Festival in São Paulo, Brazil, one of the main cinematographic events in Latin America.
Starring Rodrigo Santoro, the film tells the story of Crisóstomo, a fisherman who finds a new meaning in life when he takes in Camilo (Miguel Martines), a young orphan. The relationship between them triggers a reflection on love, acceptance and the bonds that define the concept of family. Filmed in Búzios and Chapada Diamantina, the film is a co-production between Biônica Filmes and Barry Company, which focuses on a delicate and symbolic visual approach, highlights the publisher.
According to Netflix, it is “a fable about loneliness, love and acceptance”, which translates the emotional strength of Valter Hugo Mãe's writing into film. The cast also includes Rebeca Jamir, Johnny Massaro, Miguel Martines, Juliana Caldas, Grace Passô, Inez Viana, Lívia Silva, Antonio Haddad and Tuna Dwek.
The São Paulo film festival also showed, in its world premiere, on October 25th, the biographical documentary “De Lugar Não”, by Portuguese director Miguel Gonçalves Mendes, about Valter Hugo Mãe and his creative process, which should arrive in Portuguese cinemas in 2026.
“Retrato intimista”
The work paints an intimate portrait of Valter Hugo Mãe, following the writer over seven years, as he wrote the novel “A Dehumanização”, between trips to Iceland, Brazil, Portugal, Colombia and Macau, according to information from the Portuguese consulate in São Paulo.
The documentary, a visual meditation on loneliness, loss and belonging, features the participation of cartoonist Laerte Coutinho and Icelandic composer Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, mentor of bands such as Sigur Ros and Bjork, according to the exhibition's official page. The film “From nowhere” is part of the “The Meaning of Life” project, on which director Miguel Gonçalves Mendes has been working for more than a decade — a set of nine feature films, in a kaleidoscope of contemporary figures.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:21:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Technology | Beijing launches plan to accelerate self-sufficiency</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/tecnologia-pequim-lanca-plano-para-acelerar-auto-suficiencia/</link><description>The Chinese Communist Party called for a national mobilization to achieve “decisive” advances in semiconductors and key technologies, on the eve of the meeting between the country's President and his North American counterpart in South Korea.
The initiative comes at a time of renewed commercial tension with the United States, marked by the increasing use of technological controls and restrictions on access to strategic materials. In the text published by the PCC, which details the priorities for the 2026-2030 five-year plan, the party calls for “extraordinary measures” to achieve technological self-sufficiency in key areas.
The official version of Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech on the plan, released yesterday by the official Xinhua news agency, highlights the need to “accelerate high-level scientific and technological self-sufficiency”. “The proposals must promote original innovation and ensure that China firmly maintains control of its growth trajectory”, stated the Chinese President, recognizing the challenges of an “increasingly adverse external environment”.
The document will serve as the basis for the preparation of the official plan by the State Council (Executive), the final version of which should be approved in March 2026. In addition to the focus on innovation, the plan proposes greater investment in “human capital”, including birth subsidies, expansion of free education, reinforcement of pensions and insurance and increased rural income.
Xi stated that these measures must be “integrated with investment in infrastructure”, to stimulate domestic consumption, a long-standing goal given the dependence on public investment and exports. Among the new priority sectors are quantum computing, unmanned aerial vehicles ('drones'), biotechnology, hydrogen and fusion energy, humanoid robots with artificial intelligence, brain-machine interfaces and 6G mobile networks. The use of artificial intelligence across industries is equally highlighted as a priority for the next five years.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:47:21</pubDate></item><item><title>HK | Smuggling case worth 200 million dollars discovered</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/contrabando-sete-casos-na-semana-passada/</link><description>Shark fins, cigars, cell phones, pharmaceutical products and even donkey skin. These are the products discovered in two more smuggling cases discovered by the Hong Kong Customs Service (SA) on the 3rd and 7th of this month.
According to a statement from this organization, the value of the goods is around 200 million US dollars, with two ships involved, one of them destined for river trade. This ship was destined for Macau and was caught by the authorities on October 3rd. Five containers destined for Taiwan were also inspected and were declared to be transporting frozen food. On October 7, the SA in Hong Kong realized that 150 tons of donkey skin were circulating here and not the declared food.
The same statement indicates that the investigation continues and that “the possibility of arrests is not excluded”. Under Hong Kong's Import and Export Law, anyone found guilty of importing or exporting undeclared cargo is subject to a maximum fine of US$2 million and a seven-year prison sentence upon conviction.
Seven cases last week
Taking into account the holding of the National Games starting next month, the Customs Service (SA) wants to show service and admitted to having reinforced inspection efforts at the Portas do Cerco Border Post. As a result of these efforts, seven cases of smuggling were recorded between 21 and 25 October.
According to a statement from the SA of Macau, within the scope of the seven cases, customs agents found a total of 120 old cell phones, often used to circumvent internet access limitations, 85 pieces of electronic products and 1344 grams of cigar.
The smugglers involved residents of Macau and the Interior, aged between 38 and 64 years old. Those involved were fined, the SA announced, under the provisions of the foreign trade law.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>This week, China purchased two shipments of soybeans from the United States, the first of the current harvest, after months of suspension due to tariffs, Bloomberg reported yesterday, on the eve of the meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump.
Sources cited by the agency indicated that the shipments have already been reserved for future dates and could be part of the “preliminary agreement” signed by Beijing and Washington last week, in Kuala Lumpur, in preparation for the high-level meeting scheduled for this Thursday, in South Korea. The acquisition could mark the resumption of soybean trade flows between the two countries, within the framework of a broader understanding between the two leaders, which includes the reversal of tariffs and restrictions imposed in recent months.
On Sunday, the US Treasury Secretary and head of the negotiating team, Scott Bessent, anticipated a strong return of Chinese purchases, guaranteeing that US farmers would be “extremely satisfied” with the terms of the agreement. Since Donald Trump reactivated the trade war with the imposition of tariffs in April, China has used soybeans as an instrument of pressure.
Despite Trump's calls “to quadruple” orders, China diversified suppliers, increasing imports from Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, investing in domestic production and even reducing the use of soybeans in livestock farming, according to consultancy Trivium.
The same consultant warned that Chinese leaders “have no interest” in returning to depend on the US for their food security and ruled out a “structural restart” of bilateral soybean trade. This month, state television CCTV indicated that the US could lose up to 16 million tonnes in exports to China if orders were not resumed by mid-November. “Losing China means losing half the market”, he pointed out.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Paulo Maia and Carmo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Yelu Abaoji (872-926), the head of the nomadic Khitan people, a word sinised as Qidan, contrary to tradition, decided to establish in his vast territory in 916 a dynasty in the style of the disintegrated Tang dynasty (618-907) and all the others that preceded it, with the succession of the maximum leader becoming hereditary and not a choice by a tribal council.
He even went so far as, once again going against nomadic tradition, to build a «Supreme capital», Shangjing, Linhuangfu, designed in a grid pattern with streets aligned in the style of Chang’an, the capital of the Tang. And although it was the tribal military who made the decisions, Han civilians were chosen for state administration. He called this State Da Qidan and was posthumously given the title of Taizu Tian Huangdi, “Heavenly Emperor Taizu”. His successor would change the name of the dynasty to Liao and despite subsequent setbacks, this would be the name that would prevail.
Abaoji had a son, Yelu Bei (899-937), whom he named Crown Prince and gave the title Renhuang Wang, «Imperial King of Men», handing him over the governance of the kingdom of Dongdan. And when the time for succession arrived, Yelu Bei naturally expected to inherit his father's title, but his mother, the ruthless Empress Dowager Shulu Ping (879-953), had other plans and with cold blood and cunning made the succession fall to another of her sons.
What was improbable followed in Yelu Bei's life would be remembered years later by the poet, calligrapher and painter of the Yuan dynasty, Zhu Derun (1294-1365). Next to the figure of a horseman on a swift ride in the Deer Hunt on a horizontal scroll that was attributed to Yelu Bei (ink and color on paper, 24.6 x 79.9 cm, in the Metmuseum) he wrote: «To escape the persecution of Yelu Deguang (r. as Liao Taizong, 927-947) he crossed the sea and arrived at Dengzhou (in Shandong) and there he performed allegiance to Emperor Mingzong (r.925-933) of the Late Tang (923-936) and in return he was granted the name Li and the commandership of Huaihai.”
Li Zanhua would therefore be the name that Yelu Bei would use from then on. A name – Li – of enormous prestige because this was the name of the ruling family during the Tang dynasty, offered by Emperor Xianzong (r.805-820) to the founders of that second of the Five Dynasties period as a reward for their loyalty and which they carried, like the name Tang, with pride. Li Zanhua, wrote Zhu Derun, “used to take paintings and books with him when he traveled. He liked to paint knights with bows, on hunts or excursions. His clothes and accessories followed the rustic conventions of the barbarians because that was what he was used to and felt comfortable with. The way he used the brush was soft and fine while the dynamism of the men and horses corresponds to the spirit of the 8th century Tang. A painting that deserves to be appreciated.”</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>This week, China purchased two shipments of soybeans from the United States, the first of the current harvest, after months of suspension due to tariffs, Bloomberg reported yesterday, on the eve of the meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump.

The decision was taken after a meeting with his government colleague in charge of Culture, Rachida Dati, said the same ministerial source, cited by the French news agency AFP.
The institution, in the center of the French capital, remained closed yesterday, one day after a group, still at large, managed to steal multiple works of jewelry art. "The Louvre Museum will remain closed today (yesterday) for exceptional reasons. We apologize for the inconvenience", read a message published on the museum's official website.
A group of four men stole jewelry on Sunday morning, in just a few minutes and when the museum was already open and with visitors inside, using a forklift machine, parked on the respective bank of the River Seine, and raising it to the height of a window on the first floor of the building.
The group took eight pieces “of inestimable heritage value”, including the tiara of Empress Eugenie (wife of Napoleon III, emperor from 1852 to 1870) and two necklaces, the French Ministry of Culture reported on Sunday. That jewel alone has 212 pearls and 1,998 diamonds, according to the Louvre's description, while the pieces belonging to Queen Maria Amélia have multiple sapphires and hundreds of diamonds.
This Parisian museum is the largest and most visited in the world, with nine million people enjoying part of the 35,000 works that the institution houses, in its 73 thousand square meters of space.</description><pubDate>2025-10-21 01:53:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Cuts leave 13.7 million people at risk of extreme hunger</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/16/cortes-levam-137-milhoes-de-pessoas-a-correr-risco-de-fome-extrema/</link><description>Cuts in humanitarian aid funding could expose up to 13.7 million people to extreme hunger around the world, the World Food Program (WFP) warned yesterday. “The humanitarian aid system is under severe pressure as partners withdraw from frontline areas, creating a void,” the Rome-based agency said in a new report titled “A lifebuoy in danger.”
The UN agency said that six of its operations – in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan – are “facing major disruptions, which will only worsen”. WFP warned that its financing “has never been so challenging”, anticipating “a 40 percent drop” in 2025, “which will translate into a projected budget of US$6.4 billion, compared to US$10 billion in 2024”.
The report does not name any countries, but points to a study published in the medical journal The Lancet, which found that 14 million additional deaths worldwide from disease, nutritional deficiencies and maternal and perinatal conditions could occur by 2030 as a result of cuts in US humanitarian aid alone.
Returns and records
Since US President Donald Trump's return to the White House, Washington has announced massive cuts in its foreign aid, dealing a huge blow to humanitarian operations around the world. "Program coverage has been significantly reduced and rations cut. Vital assistance to families in food disaster situations [Phase 5 of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification/IPC] is threatened, while preparedness for future impacts has significantly decreased," warns WFP.
Globally, “WFP estimates that its funding gaps could push 10.5 to 13.7 million people currently in acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) into a humanitarian emergency (IPC Phase 4),” the organization added. The UN agency said global hunger has now reached record levels, with 319 million people facing acute food insecurity — including 44 million at emergency levels.</description><pubDate>2025-10-16 02:52:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Death | António Coelho dies aged 77, but leaves a legacy in Portuguese gastronomy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/14/obito-antonio-coelho-morre-com-77-anos-mas-deixa-legado-na-gastronomia-portuguesa/</link><description>The founder of Restaurante António died on Sunday in Macau, due to heart problems. Behind him, he leaves a mark and an innovative concept for promoting Portuguese food in Asia
A father, a friend and one of the great ambassadors of Portuguese gastronomy in Asia. Chef António Coelho died on Sunday, aged 77, due to heart problems, but leaves behind a professional career spanning almost 40 years and an influence that can be felt in several restaurants and Portuguese food chefs in Macau.
Born in Portugal in 1948, António Coelho's first contact with Macau took place in 1970, when he had to complete his four-year mandatory military service. After two years, the land remained in his memory, but the future chef chose to return to Europe.
In Portugal, he started working at Social Security, later moving to a clinical analysis laboratory. It was in this area that he developed his taste for gastronomy, not through work, but through various lunches and dinners in different restaurants. Increasingly interested in cooking, António decided to take a job, in 1984, in a restaurant, where he admitted to having learned to cook, according to an interview with the South China Morning Post newspaper, in 2018.
The first years of António Coelho's new career were spent in Portugal, where he performed different roles as manager-administrator of the Botequim do Rei restaurant or director of the catering department at the Grande Hotel da Curia. In 1996, he had his first international experience, as director of the restaurant department at the Hotel Trópico, in Cape Verde. The experience lasts one year.
Creating a legacy
Returning to Macau in 1997, António worked for 10 years in different spaces, such as the restaurants Frol de la Mar, Lusitano, Lisbon, and also had a brief stay in Hong Kong, in 2002, at Restaurante Inn. However, the decisive step towards his affirmation as one of the most influential chefs of Portuguese gastronomy in Asia came in 2007, with the opening of Restaurante António.
And the success that followed was not the result of chance, as said by Edgar Rodrigues, a chef who came to Macau to work on the launch of the project: “The success was based on the recipes, the quality of the food, but also the very professionalism”, says Edgar Rodrigues, to HM. "He was very attentive to his customers. If there was an order for clams à bolhão pato, he would have different recipes adapted to the nationality. For example, Koreans don't like coriander, the recipe for them didn't have coriander. Chinese customers like little salt, they were served with little salt, and locals like the more traditional recipe. In a single dish there were several ways of cooking, just to satisfy different customers", he recalls.
Cristiano Tavares, currently chef at the Macalhau restaurant, also came to Macau to work at the António Restaurant. He believes that the chef found a position for Portuguese food that still influences other restaurants today. “I think his success was due to his way of being, he was a politically correct person, he had a way of working that pleased both Chinese, Korean and Japanese tourists”, explained Cristiano Tavares, to HM. "We were a street restaurant with four or five cooks. He managed to do what many large restaurants still cannot do today. Nowadays there are many restaurants with Portuguese food that open in Macau, but follow the example of what he did", he considered.
Quality and spectacle
In addition to the food, Restaurante António customers were seduced by the “show”. This is the vision of Marcelino Marques, António's friend and musician who for several years livened up the space's nights, with traditional Portuguese music.
"The quality of the food made the space popular. He took great care in choosing the food and drinks served. He went to Portugal to choose wines from various regions, such as Douro or Alentejo, all of high quality, which were bottled under the António brand. People knew they weren't going to pay little, not that it was a space with luxury prices, it wasn't, but the quantity served wasn't small", recalled Marcelino Marques.
However, the musician believes that the success was also due to a concept in which the meal was also a spectacle: "People liked listening to Portuguese music, but also being with António. He was an affable, big person and appeared in that white jacket with the flags of Portugal, China and Macau and people liked his presence and asked him to take photographs", he says. "He also opened a bottle of champagne with a sword. He did a whole ceremony and people really liked it. It was a spectacle and a party to see the cork flying out of the bottle. It worked well", he recalled.
Marcelino Marques recalls that the food and the show made the restaurant very famous, especially among Japanese, Korean and Hong Kong tourists. The musician reveals that Japanese tourists booked days in advance. And this factor also contributed to the fact that António offered a glass of port wine at the end of the meal, which also led to the recognition of the Port Wine Confraternity.
The success of Restaurante António led the chef to sell the space to an investment fund, becoming an ambassador for the space. The break with the fund happened in 2020, when he was fired without just cause. The case ended up in court, with António winning the case. In recent years, António took on the position of executive chef at Angela’s Café and Lounge, at the Hotel Lisboeta.
A father, a friend
Due to his work in Macau, António was distinguished, in 2013, by the Macao SAR Government with the MSAR Tourist Merit Medal. Also in 2015, he received the merit medal for Portuguese communities from the Portuguese Government. However, for those who worked with him the most important thing was the relationship that went beyond the strictly professional field.
"He had a big impact on Macau and for me he was like a second father. When I came to Macau I didn't have an easy life and he always held my hand", confessed Rodrigues. "He was always a person who was there for me. And I always saw him as a man of iron. In everything he did, there was a great will", he pointed out.
This is a feeling shared by Cristiano Tavares. "António is my father in Macau. He worked until the last day, always with seriousness, honesty and integrity. He is an example for all the chefs in this area", he said.
For Marcelino Marques, António's death is the loss of a friend. "António was the person who welcomed me to Macau and was capable of doing the same to everyone. He was strict and demanding, but he was an excellent person", he described. "Everyone knew him. He was an affable person and received people like no one else", he added.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Pop Mart, maker of Labubu, falls 10.8% in Hong Kong amid doubts about growth</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/24/pop-mart-fabricante-de-labubu-cai-108-em-hong-kong-entre-duvidas-sobre-crescimento/</link><description>Shares in Pop Mart, the Chinese company responsible for the global phenomenon of Labubu figures, sank 10.8% this Thursday, the biggest drop since April, in a new episode of volatility that contrasts with the good sales results released the day before.
The devaluation reflects investors' growing caution regarding the possibility of a slowdown in the company's growth, after several quarters driven by the popularity of its collectible products.
On Wednesday, Pop Mart shares rose 4.23% on the Hong Kong stock exchange, despite the negative tone of the market, following the announcement that revenue in the third quarter increased between 245% and 250%, driven by Labubu's virality on social media and the company's international expansion.
According to data provided by the company, domestic sales grew 190%, while international sales soared 370%, highlighted by increases of 175% in the Asia-Pacific region, more than 740% in Europe and almost 1,270% in the United States. The strong drop recorded today is largely attributed to profit taking, after appreciation of more than 186% since the beginning of the year, and uncertainty about the sustainability of the current growth rate.
The stock fell 8.1% on Tuesday, its worst performance since April, weighed down by fears of a slowdown in sales after months of euphoria. The preliminary release of results helped to temporarily dispel these concerns, but the absence of an official date for the presentation of the accounts maintains uncertainty regarding the company's future evolution. Executive chairman and founder Wang Ning expressed confidence in the long-term resilience of the Labubu character, arguing that cultural icons continue to generate revenue even after peak popularity.
According to the Bloomberg agency, the explosion in demand forced the company itself to revise its internal goals upwards. If at the beginning of 2024 Pop Mart predicted a turnover of 2,800 million dollars (around 2,400 million euros), in August Wang raised this target to 4,200 million dollars (3,600 million euros), pointing to the brand's global momentum as a key factor.
Founded in Beijing in 2010, Pop Mart has established itself as one of the main Asian references in the toy and collectible figures sector, combining exclusive design, limited editions and collaborations with international brands, artists and franchises.
Its business model is based on so-called “surprise boxes”, which encourage repeat purchases and have created a community of fans willing to pay high premiums for rare pieces. Among its main lines is Labubu, a monster with pointy ears and a mischievous smile inspired by Norse mythology, created by Hong Kong artist Lung Ka-sing in 2015 and integrated into the company's portfolio in 2019.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Chemistry | Nobel Prize for the development of metal-organic structures</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/09/quimica-nobel-para-o-desenvolvimento-de-estruturas-metalorganicas/</link><description>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Susumu Kitagawa, from Kyoto University, Richard Robson, from the University of Melbourne, and Omar M. Yaghi, from the University of California, “for the development of metal-organic structures”, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced yesterday.
Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar Yaghi have developed a new form of molecular architecture – metal-organic frameworks – that can be used to collect water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide, store toxic gases or catalyze chemical reactions.
The three laureates created molecular constructs with large spaces through which gases and other chemicals could flow. The president of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, Heiner Linque, highlighted precisely the fact that these “metal-organic structures have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for personalized materials with new functions”.
The research that led to the discovery of this new form of molecular architecture began nearly four decades ago, in 1989, when Richard Robson tested the use of the inherent properties of atoms by combining positively charged copper ions with a four-armed molecule.
When combined, they bonded "to form a spacious, well-ordered crystal. It was like a diamond filled with countless cavities," the academy explains. Robson immediately realized the potential of his molecular construction, but it was still unstable and crumbled easily. It was chemists Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi who managed to provide a solid foundation for this construction method.
Notable applications
Following the discoveries of the three laureates, chemists built tens of thousands of different MOFs. Some of them could contribute to solving some of humanity's biggest challenges, with applications including breaking down traces of pharmaceuticals in the environment, capturing carbon dioxide or collecting water from desert air.
The discovery also allows the separation of perfluoroalkylated and polyfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS) from water. PFAS are a group of synthetic chemical compounds known as “forever chemicals” due to their extreme persistence in the environment and in the human body.
PFAS are used in a wide range of industrial and household products, such as stain- and water-resistant textiles, food packaging, non-stick cookware and firefighting foams. Its accumulation in the environment and potential health risks, including liver damage and other problems, have led to concerns and a search for safer alternatives.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:41:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Study | Trump was the main disseminator of disinformation in the USA in 2024</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/09/estudo-trump-foi-principal-disseminador-de-desinformacao-nos-eua-em-2024/</link><description>North American President Donald Trump was the main disseminator of disinformation in the United States of America (USA) in 2024, concluded a study by the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ). “US President Donald Trump was the dominant source and distributor of disinformation” in 2024, say the authors of the study “Disarming Disinformation: United States”.
The study highlights that Trump has drawn on the functions of domestic political forces, rather than foreign state actors, as the main source of disinformation narratives in US political discourse. Furthermore, the existence of WhatsApp groups and other closed digital spaces often act as “information cocoons” that encourage rumors and other forms of misinformation.
In this way, "the viral spread of misinformation and the strategic attack on journalists have emerged as interconnected threats to democracy. In an era of increasing authoritarianism and democratic backsliding, falsehoods are often used as a weapon by state actors to influence public opinion, undermine journalism and intimidate journalists."
The study authors state that these factors are increasingly the North American reality, with Donald Trump “promulgating manifestly false narratives” in recent years.
“The American media faces a profound information crisis, at a time of repression of freedom of expression”, the study reads. In this sense, trust in the mainstream press continues to decline in a climate of increasing attacks on the media by the Trump Government.
The study published by the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) was based on the analysis of 10,000 news and media publications during 2024, as well as a survey of 1,020 Americans.</description><pubDate>2025-10-09 00:38:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Scientists ‘reduce’ the age of the Egyptian temple of Karnak, in Egypt</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/08/cientistas-reduzem-idade-do-templo-egipcio-de-karnak-no-egipto/</link><description>Researchers have carried out the most comprehensive geoarchaeological study of the Karnak temple, near Luxor, and revealed suggestive links to ancient Egyptian mythology and new data about the interaction between the complex's riverine landscape and the people who occupied the site during its almost 3,000 years of use.
The results of the investigation were published on Monday in Antiquity magazine, reported the Efe news agency. Researchers from the University of Southampton, in the United Kingdom, and Uppsala University, in Sweden, participated in the study. Up to 61 sediment samples from the interior and surroundings of the temple and thousands of ceramic fragments found in the Karnak complex, located 500 meters east of the current Nile River, near Luxor, in the ancient Egyptian religious capital of Thebes, were analyzed.
The researchers mapped how the landscape around the site changed throughout its history and found that, before 2520 BC, the site could not have been suitable for permanent occupation due to periodic flooding caused by the Nile's strong currents. Therefore, they placed the earliest occupation at Karnak during the Old Kingdom (between 2591 and 2152 BC).
Pottery fragments found at the site corroborate this discovery, with the oldest dating between 2305 and 1980 BC. Therefore, the conclusions of this international team of researchers provide new evidence about the age of Karnak, which has been hotly debated in archaeological circles for decades.
The origin of everything
The ground on which the temple was founded was formed when river channels advanced west and east, creating an island of high ground in what is now the east-southeast region of the site. This emerging island laid the foundation for the occupation and initial construction of Karnak.
Over the following centuries and millennia, the river channels on both sides of the site diverged further, creating more space for the development of the temple complex, as researchers have now confirmed. This new understanding of the temple's landscape bears striking similarities to an ancient Egyptian creation myth, leading the team to believe that the decision to locate the temple there may have been related to the religious views of its inhabitants.
Ancient Egyptian texts from the Old Kingdom indicate that the 'Creator God' manifested himself as high ground emerging from the lake, and researchers have found that the island where Karnak was founded is the only known area of ​​high ground surrounded by water in the region.
Thus, archaeologists have suggested that the Theban elites chose the location of Karnak to be the abode of a new form of 'Creator God', alluding to Amun-Ra, the supreme god of ancient Egypt, since the location fit perfectly into the mythological setting of the highlands that emerged from the surrounding waters as the origin of the formation of the Universe.</description><pubDate>2025-10-08 17:22:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Government | Wong Sio Chak visited public services</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/governo-wong-sio-chak-visitou-servicos-publicos/</link><description>Having recently taken office as Secretary for Administration and Justice, Wong Sio Chak recently visited several public services under his authority, in order to find out how they work.
Since October 16th, when he took office, he has visited the Directorate of Justice Affairs Services (DSAJ), the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM), the Directorate of Administration and Public Service Services (SAFP) and the Official Press (IO), “having exchanged opinions with management and leadership staff and frontline workers”, highlights an official note.
In the case of DSAJ, the visit took place on the 21st, with the secretary “taking note of the status of the work due to the merger of DSAJ with IO”, which will be formalized from this Friday. Another visit took place on Monday afternoon, with the government official, in the company of SAFP director Leong Weng In, and other leaders, visiting “the work offices of that service and meeting with management and leadership staff, to learn more about the work to promote Public Administration reform, matters relating to voter registration and public service on the front line of the Public Information Center”, among other tasks.
Wong Sio Chak left several notes on these visits, namely “the strengthening of unity and cooperation” between workers and the promotion of “horizontal and positive communication, in order to unite the team’s synergy”, and should also focus on “the reformist and innovative spirit and assuming its responsibilities”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:08:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Qinghai | Sam Hou Fai highlights tourist attraction</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/qinghai-sam-hou-fai-destaca-atractividade-turistica/</link><description>Sam Hou Fai highlighted the “abundant eco-tourism” resources of Qinghai province, which he said is one of the places sought after by residents. The statements are contained in a press release, following a meeting between the Chief Executive and the deputy secretary of the provincial committee of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) and governor of Qinghai province, Luo Dongchuan, at the Government Headquarters, which took place last Monday.
In addition to highlighting the tourist attractiveness of the province whose capital is Xining, Sam Hou Fai also pointed out that the two Chinese regions should reinforce their focus on tourism by “working together to explore more tourism products to achieve mutual complementarity of advantages and common development”.
At the meeting, Sam Hou Fai indicated that Macau is a “precision interlocutor” between China and Portuguese-speaking countries and that it can “actively play the role of a service platform for commercial cooperation”. The Chief Executive thus showed the Macao SAR as a platform to “help Qinghai's characteristic products to explore more promotion and sales channels within Portuguese-speaking countries”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:06:14</pubDate></item><item><title>HK / Elections | John Lee praises Macau model and promises to follow it</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/hk-eleicoes-john-lee-elogia-modelo-de-macau-e-promete-segui-lo/</link><description>The Chief Executive of the neighboring region confirmed that he sent representatives to Macau to learn from the experience of the September Legislatures. John Lee also confirmed that he sent letters to civil servants indicating that voting is a proof of loyalty to the Basic Law and the HKSAR
The Chief Executive of Hong Kong promised to follow the Macau model in the next elections for the Legislative Council. John Lee praised the measures in Macau, where public servants were warned that abstention in Legislatures could be understood as a lack of patriotism, and some heads of Public Administration departments prepared questionnaires about their subordinates' voting intentions.
“I have already asked all public services to take all possible measures so that employees who need to work on voting day can travel to the polling stations in a convenient way,” said the leader of the Hong Kong Government. Like Sam Hou Fai, John Lee admitted that he also sent a letter to civil servants indicating that participation in the elections is taken as proof of loyalty to the Basic Law and the HKSAR.
Unlike what happened in Macau, at first, John Lee's letter was publicly released. In the letter, the Chief Executive indicates that public servants need to be an example of civic responsibility, which they should do when voting. However, John Lee did not clarify, similar to what happened in Macau, whether he will penalize public servants who choose not to go to the polls.
Messages to companies
The leader of the Hong Kong Government also publicly acknowledged that as a way of preparing the Legislatures, several representatives of his Government were in Macau, where they met with local government officials, to learn about the model. John Lee gave a very positive assessment of this exchange, which he explained by considering that the elections in the Macao SAR were “carried out successfully”.
However, the HKSAR Government's efforts do not stop at just mobilizing public servants. As happened in Macau, where some concessionaires and state-owned companies questioned workers about their intention to vote and arranged transport, in Hong Kong it is intended that private companies will also mobilize workers. “I also appeal to all private and public entities, organizations and companies to encourage their employees to vote, with appropriate measures”, can be read in the letter made public.
Despite this plan, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong did not set a target for voter participation. "We don't have any rigid indicators, but we will do our best. That's our indicator", said John Lee. In the Macau Legislature, the participation rate was 53.35 percent, the third lowest since the transition of sovereignty.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:01:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Administration | Nick Lei accuses managers of incompetence</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/administracao-nick-lei-acusa-dirigentes-de-incompetencia/</link><description>Deputy Nick Lei accused several public service managers of not having “knowledge” for the functions they perform and treating their positions as “feudal states”. The accusation by the deputy linked to the Fujian community was made during the intervention before the agenda of the Legislative Assembly plenary.
In an intervention in which he called for a reform of the laws that regulate Public Administration, Nick Lei indicated that “in the face of internal and external changes, the challenges of economic development and the growing needs of society in the context of public services” it is necessary to implement changes, to achieve “practical and viable results for residents”.
Law later defended that “the lack of clarity regarding the powers and responsibilities of public services, the lack of interdepartmental coordination, the complexity of administrative procedures, the irresponsible attitude of the services, the action of each one in their own way and the outdatedness of some laws and regulations”, shows that “many leaders do not have sufficient knowledge about the services they provide, and that, in addition, bureaucracy and “feudal states” continue to constitute obstacles to increasing government efficiency and promoting development socio-economic”.
In this sense, the deputy asked that Xi Jinping's speeches be followed and that the Government move forward with changes in the face of the obstacles that impede its own development.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 01:59:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Labor Rights | Leong Pou U debuts with orders</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/direitos-laborais-leong-pou-u-estreia-se-com-pedidos/</link><description>Deputy Leong Pou U made his debut in the Chamber calling on the Executive to update several labor rights, which have not undergone any changes for more than 30 years.
“In reality, Macau's labor standards are always behind those of neighboring countries and regions, despite having a socioeconomic development similar to that of Macau, [...] and some labor standards have not been updated for decades”, began by stating the deputy linked to the Operários. “For example, working hours and annual holidays have not been changed since 1984, that is, 41 years; mandatory holidays have not been adjusted for 36 years, since 1989”, he pointed out.
Based on these data, the deputy elected indirectly called on the Executive to move forward as quickly as possible with the “systematic review and improvement of labor laws and regulations, taking into account the real situation and the development trend of the Macau labor market”.
Despite this request, Leong Pou U defended the need for a consensus between employers and workers to implement changes, which rarely happens, even within the Permanent Council for Social Concertation (CPCS).</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>AL | Leaders of work committees defined</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/al-definidas-liderancas-das-comissoes-de-trabalho/</link><description>José Chui Sai Peng will assume the presidency of the Rules and Mandates Committee, one of the most important committees. O português José Pereira Coutinho é o deputado mais experiente, mais velho e foi o “rei dos votos” no sufrágio directo, mas nem assim foi escolhido para qualquer cargo de liderança
On Tuesday, deputies chose the compositions and presidencies of the Legislative Assembly's working committees. Legislator and businessman José Chui Sai Peng will assume the presidency of the Rules and Mandates Committee, which is particularly important as it has the power to suggest changes to the legislative body's operating rules.
For the cousin of the former Chief Executive, Fernando Chui Sai On, the presidency of a committee is nothing new, given that in the previous Legislature he led the Monitoring Committee for Public Land and Concessions Affairs. In relation to the secretary of the Rules and Mandates Committee, the choice of deputies fell on the lawyer and academic Iau Teng Pio.
With regard to the permanent work committees, the 1st Committee will be led by Wong Kit Cheng, a nurse by training and Women's deputy. The secretary will be Nick Lei Leong Wong. Wong also has experience in leading committee work, as in the previous Legislature he led the Monitoring Committee for Public Finance Matters.
In the 2nd Commission, the presidency was handed over to Ip Sio Kai, vice-president of the Bank of China (Macau), while the vice-presidency went to Lam Lon Wai, from the Workers' Party. In the 3rd Commission, the person chosen for president was Leong Sun Iok, also a Workers' deputy, while the secretary will be Leong Hong Sai, linked to the Residents.
Lots of follow-up
As for the monitoring committees, they also underwent several changes. In the Monitoring Committee for Land Affairs and Public Concessions, the presidency was attributed to Ella Lei Cheng I. In the previous Legislature, the Workers' deputy was the president of the 1st Permanent Committee. The secretary will be Joey Lao Chi Ngai, returned to the hemicycle, after being passed over as a legislator appointed by the Chief Executive by Ho Iat Seng.
In the Monitoring Committee for Public Finance Affairs, Song Pek Kei will assume the presidency, while Ngan Iek Hang will serve as vice president. Finally, at the level of the Monitoring Committee for Public Administration Affairs, businessman Ma Chi Seng will be responsible for the presidency, with Kou Kam Fai as secretary.
The presidency of the Administrative Council of the Legislative Assembly, which deals with matters such as the hemicycle's budget, was handed over to Ângela Leong On Kei. The committees' choices also confirm that José Pereira Coutinho was excluded from any leadership position despite being the most experienced deputy in the hemicycle, the oldest and also the one who was the “king of votes” in direct suffrage.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 01:42:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Kiang Wu | Association received 234.14 million patacas</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/kiang-wu-associacao-recebeu-23414-milhoes-de-patacas/</link><description>The Kiang Wu Hospital Charitable Association received almost 9 out of every 10 patacas distributed in support by the Health Services in the third quarter. In total, 270.35 million patacas were allocated in subsidies
The Kiang Wu Hospital Charity Association received 234.14 million patacas in subsidies paid by the Health Services, which in the third quarter of this year totaled 270.35 million patacas. The data was revealed last week, and means that for every 10 patacas distributed by the SS in support, practically nine end up deposited in the private hospital's accounts.
The main supports were declared as “subsidy for the inpatient service”, referring to different months of the year, in a total of four subsidies. All of this support for the inpatient service amounted to more than 40 million patacas, with the highest amount being reached in May, with a tranche of 43.04 million patacas. In March, the amount was 41.74 million patacas, in July it dropped to 41.36 million patacas and in April it was 40.21 million patacas.
These transfers represented 166.35 million patacas of the total 234.14 million received by the institution.
The second largest type of support granted by the Health Services to Kiang Wu was due to the “protocol subsidy to finance the medical expenses of cardiac patients”. As part of this support, four monetary tranches were paid, corresponding to four months.
In March, financing of medical expenses for cardiac patients reached the highest value, with a total of 12.70 million patacas. In May, the value was 9.87 million patacas, while in April it was 7.68 million patacas and in June 7.48 million patacas.
Other smaller supports involved subsidizing the operation of the Hong Ling Center, expenses with examination services for cervical cancer screening, external vaccination consultations and subsidizing audit expenses for the Kiang Wu School of Nursing for the year 2023. 
Regular customers
As for the associations supported by the SS, the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau (FAOM) received 18.37 million patacas, with the majority of the subsidies going to the rehabilitation nursing services of the Recovery Center.
The SS granted the center three tranches of 4.57 million patacas, for the operation of the center in the months of July, August and September. Other support to FAOM aimed at “providing external consultation services”, with monthly support amounting to just over 1 million patacas.
On the podium of the most supported institutions, the Tong Sin Tong Charitable Association also appears, receiving 9.48 million patacas. Among this support, the largest share was justified with the “provision of external consultation and treatment services” in the months of September, August and July. In all periods there was a fixed subsidy of 3.08 million patacas. However, there was also other smaller support, with subsidies of around 50 thousand patacas officially justified with a “fissure sealant program”.
List of institutions
The distribution of the 270.35 million patacas by the SS covered 12 local institutions. In the list, it is possible to find other associations such as Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Macau, which received around 103 thousand patacas, and Cáritas de Macau, to which 315 thousand patacas were distributed. In the case of these two institutions, the support was due to the provision of medical care in local nursing homes.
The names of the supported institutions also include the New Chinese Youth Association of Macau, which received 5.17 million patacas, to support the recovery center in providing external consultations or cancer screening. This association also received a subsidy of 160 patacas, the lowest of those awarded, related to HIV virus screening tests.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:37:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Global Strategic Triangle (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/triangulo-estrategico-global-ii/</link><description>“Winning the AI ​​race will usher in a new golden age.”
U.S. Defense Innovation Board, 2023
After the United States, Russia is the only major power with deep blood ties to Israel. The diaspora of Jews from the post-Soviet space, which began more than four decades ago, has allowed Moscow to have a community of around one million Russians living in Israeli territory, many of them integrated into the elites. Communication between Netanyahu and Putin is direct and functional. In the Kremlin, there are those who welcome the eventual rise of Naftali Bennett, a Jew of American origin and informal mediator in the Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in 2022, interrupted by external pressure. In this context, the possibility of Israel expanding its current seven theaters of war is not remote. The accelerated erosion of internal balance in the triangle with Iran and Turkey weakens the region's geopolitical buffers. The physical distance of almost two thousand kilometers that separates Israel from Iran becomes increasingly irrelevant, as tension between the two regimes intensifies, enveloped in a rhetoric of mutual demonization.
The crisis in the strategic corridor that connects Herat to Beirut, passing through Tehran, Baghdad and Damascus, fuels the possibility of a direct confrontation. With Turkey, the playing field is different. Syria became the field for maneuver. Damascus, recently taken over by jihadist militias supported by Ankara, is dangerously close to Israeli positions beyond the Golan. A scenario of unstable balance between Turks in Aleppo and Israelis in Damascus begins to emerge. Erdogan, with long-term ambitions, dreams of the symbolic reconquest of Jerusalem and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, in a future in which Israel does not exist. Although Tel Aviv does not admit it, the real strategic challenge lies not in Iran, weakened and in survival mode, but in Turkey, whose neo-imperial vision extends from the Middle East to North Africa. Pragmatism could lead Israel to seek rapprochement with Tehran to contain Ankara, whose expansion is more tangible and threatening.
The mosaic of rivalries in the Middle East appears to be contained, but its merger with the Ukrainian conflict via the Caucasus or the Black Sea is not a hypothesis to be ruled out. The cross-analysis of the three major war scenarios leads to three conclusions. The first, that of possible peace, will always be imperfect and can only be born from gradual compromises between the United States and China, with Russia as a key player. It is these three powers that have the capacity to annihilate each other and, with that, put an end to life on the planet. The true leader of the century will be the one who manages to attract Moscow into his sphere, offering it the illusion of autonomy. Europe, even in its most ambitious versions, will compete for secondary places in the train led by Washington or Beijing. Middle powers with global aspirations such as Japan, India or Türkiye itself will occupy prominent positions, but always subject to an unstable balance. There is no absolute hegemony, just a dance of forces in permanent tension. Nothing that compares to the order of Vienna or the bipolar geometry of Yalta. Today's world is a ballroom where decadent aristocrats and sophisticated privateers dance under mutual surveillance, maintaining overlapping and intertwining spheres of influence.
Compromise between the greats is not the end of the story, but the only way to prevent it from ending. Under this fragile truce, smaller-scale conflicts will multiply, especially between the Middle East and Africa, intermittent wars, without a plan or horizon, in forgotten territories or disputed by neighbors and distant powers. Two variables, however, escape any control: a possible confrontation between Russia and China, still remote but plausible, and a direct clash between Russia and the United States, less likely but facilitated by the proximity of contact lines in Eastern Europe, especially after the division of Ukraine. It won't be tomorrow. But the day after tomorrow might be too late. We live in a time of forced coexistence, imposed by the impossibility of a rationally conceived world war. Localized or even global conflicts may arise, as long as they remain below the nuclear threshold.

In 2020, a television series inspired by the book came out, which, with the same name, also became a success. It is a story about two young people, an Irish boy and an Irish girl, from their final year of secondary school, in Sligo, in the west of Ireland, until the end of their degree at Trinity College, in Dublin. People who fall in love, who get confused and who have sex – play the game of intimacy as best they can and delve into fractured and painful issues. Rooney shows that true intimacy is not built on desire, but on the ability to manage, or allow, emotional sharing.
The story is a cliché. A girl who is not popular at school, but who comes from a financially advantaged family background, and a boy who is quite popular at school and who comes from a working class background. They become sexually and emotionally involved in an affair that both brings them together and separates them. They enter the same college and continue to go back and forth between an inordinate passion and moments of incomprehension. But that's where the cliché ends, because the way we are transported to the inner worlds of emotional expression is so rich, it removes us from the usual melodrama and transports us to a reality that is better known to us: ours, with its nuances and confusions. The book is called Normal People because what it portrays is real and normal.
In this story, sexual and physical consent is crossed by an emotional layer that makes it complex. Exploring questions about power, class and the erotic, the characters navigate that world, each with their own distinct capacity for emotional and financial fulfillment. Intimacy is a game of power, of who opens or closes doors to harmony. And the places the characters inhabit are close and distant at the same time, as if they were lost in harmony with one another. Marianne, despite her background, comes from a problematic family that taught her that her wishes, or her existence, were not important. And in this empty space, she offers the other space to overcome limits: she does not choose to give in; she just doesn't know how to contain it. Connell, who lives lost, not knowing where he belongs, finds in Marianne a way to integrate into a world different from his own, which challenges and confuses him. The events are recounted in the intimacy of each person's thoughts, and we see how they awaken diametrically opposed perceptions. Reality ceases to exist and perception shapes what we do and feel. And in moments of physical intimacy, the body becomes the only place where the truth manifests itself. Sex is not a climax, but a way of communicating – the only space where they can say what words could not. Eroticism, according to the author, is pure vulnerability.
In this story there are no villains, no heroes, just people – some say it portrays the lives of millennials in particular, in the confusion of being with others in the current context of labor and even geopolitical instability. Sex “isn't like that with other people”, as they confess to each other, and the romance and eroticism of the story lives in these explicit moments, others silent ones. With a fragmented timeline, we follow the two characters in significant stretches over five years. The rhythm presented to us reveals another mundane fact; they are growing. The relationship between Marianne and Connell is symptomatic of the growing pains that accompany them in discovering who they are – just normal people.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 02:03:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Musk's billion-dollar plan (2)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/o-plano-bilionario-de-musk-2/</link><description>Last week, we talked about Tesla's proposal to award its Executive Director, Elon Musk, 1 billion dollars in shares as a performance bonus, on condition that he achieves a series of objectives. These objectives would be: First, reverse the recent decline in car sales. Second, develop the business of selling autonomous cars, etc. After all targets are met, not only would Tesla's value and profits increase significantly, but Musk would receive huge financial compensation, thus benefiting both parties.
However, as autonomous driving technology is not yet fully developed, and countries around the world will review road legislation in light of this innovation, third-party insurance coverage will also undergo changes. These factors create uncertainty and could affect Tesla. Today, we will continue to analyze the impact that the 1 billion share compensation plan will have on Tesla, Musk and shareholders.
Third, Tesla's plan to manufacture 5,000 to 10,000 Optimus humanoid robots by 2025. The aim is to create robots that can replace manual workers, such as porters, domestic workers, etc. However, Optimus' technology is not yet perfected. Many AI companies are working hard to achieve this same purpose. It remains to be seen whether Tesla will be successful in its research and whether it will become the first company to dominate the robotics market.
Fourth, Tesla's Shanghai Energy Storage Giga factory began production last February. The company intends to work with a single energy solutions operator that provides energy generation, storage and management services to complement the automotive, robotics, supercomputer and energy businesses. This objective requires extremely high standards for both software and hardware. Tensions between China and the United States could have consequences for the import and export of products, a factor that is beyond Tesla's control.
Fifth, the fact that Musk runs several AI companies makes his attention dispersed, and some of his public statements have had an impact on Tesla's image. The performance bonus he should have received for his work in 2018 is currently under appeal and it is not yet known whether the 2025 bonus will be approved by shareholders and the courts. These are all issues that Musk must consider.
In the $1 billion performance bonus plan, Musk embodies three essential qualities in a successful business tycoon. Firstly, his management of several companies demonstrates his dedication to his work and reveals effort and passion. Second, once you reach your goals, your Tesla shares will increase from 13 percent to 25 percent. By strengthening his control over the company, Musk can continue to develop the business and lead it into the next decade of prosperity, proving his commitment to future growth. Third, Musk has a deep sense of adventure and, by taking risks, creates great benefits for the company and for himself. Only by transforming Tesla into an unprecedented technological company will Musk be able to reap substantial rewards, linking his personal assets to the company's value in the long term.
Tesla's board of directors hopes that this plan will ensure Musk's focus on his project over the next decade, leading the company towards business transformation and profit growth. If the investigation is successful, Tesla could generate substantial profits.  Failure can nullify all investments and result in losses. Risk is the essence of business. Profits and losses are precisely the consequence of taking risks. Compared to the 8.5 billion that the company is worth and its 400 billion in profit, the 1 billion prize is just a drop in the ocean. It is not a significant amount for Tesla, but it unites the interests of the company, its shareholders and Musk, cementing a common destiny.
The success of Tesla's business means increased shareholder dividends, a rise in share value and a satisfied set of shareholders. However, some of them may be afraid that Musk will not meet all the objectives proposed by the company, and that as he has more shares, the participation in the capital of these shareholders will be diluted. This plan will make it more difficult for them to pass resolutions that secure their interests in the future. In this scenario, Tesla may become unable to do without Musk, some shareholders may feel he is indispensable, but Musk may leave when his goals are achieved.
We have to wait for the result of the Tesla shareholder meeting that will take place in November and see if Musk can create another legend in the business world.

We have become accustomed to reading sad news about children who steal their mother's jewelry for certain vices or who beat their mother or father because they don't give them money to buy drugs. Now the red line has been crossed. A minor says that “my mother bothered me a lot”, takes his father's gun and kills his mother without appeal or aggravation. What this has come to.
The mother, Susana Gravato, 49 years old, was a PSD councilor at the Vagos City Council. The court has already decided to commit the minor to a closed regime and he may then remain in the same situation for another three years. The minor committed the crime in such a conscious way that, after the act, he even simulated a robbery scenario at home. When we spoke to a psychologist, she told us that the change in children's education these days is terrifying. That social networks are one of the reasons why violence is becoming commonplace and that legislation needs to change a lot with regard to access to digital.
Miguel Sousa Tavares defended the gradual ban on social networks, stressing that “They are ruining our way of life”. We live in a time of education through conditioned reflex, added the psychologist, to continue highlighting "that perhaps because we are being overtaken by dogs. We live in a time where everything is the consequence of a pseudo-trauma that ignorance can easily treat and that does nothing but prolong and worsen the disease."
We read Freud very early on, and we soon realized that, in Freud, almost everything revolved around frustration and repressed sex. Then, as was fashionable, we read Piaget thinking it would help us educate our children. We were wrong. Piaget educated, but he taught us. We discovered that educating children is not limited to theories, religions or fashions. Raising children, first and foremost, must be an act of love, otherwise the reverse side of the coin could be fatal.
In fact, the country, once considered peaceful, was shocked to learn that a daughter tried to stab her father to death and gouge out his eyes to simply keep a house, and the next day, a 14-year-old son killed his mother with his father's hidden pistol because “his mother was boring with her schoolwork”. Right, that is to say that he immediately “killed” his father and killed himself too. Madness contaminates and so does evil. They are identical twins. The Portuguese did not want to believe that the red line had been crossed and that now children were killing their parents.
A few years ago, we met José Manuel Anes, who was president of the Criminal Security and Terrorism Observatory. A man experienced in all aspects of life, security, crime and espionage. We cannot understand what education Anes gave his daughter Ana, so that she tried to stab him to death and had the “courage” to go on social media to say that she tried to kill her father because he had collaborated with the Mossad.
It's incomprehensible from a daughter. José Manuel Anes had told us that the position he held was a risky one, that he was aware that one day he could be killed, but he certainly never imagined that this could happen at the hands of his own daughter Ana, who is already in prison and who confessed to the crime. Indeed, the world has changed, and for the worse in terms of the attitudes of the new generations. Parents' fault? Perhaps. However, it is still repugnant that a 53-year-old daughter takes a knife and tries to kill her father who gave her everything including an allowance until the day he was seriously attacked. What this has come to.
José Manuel Anes was attacked inside his own house. Anes had been persecuted by his daughter for five years, with death threats on social media. The daughter intended for her father to put ownership of a house in Costa de Caparica in her name. Daughter Ana Anes' theory was that she would be able to sell the house and raise the money, since she would be unemployed.
This is the motive behind the crime determined by the Judiciary Police investigation. Furthermore, it was because he feared that his daughter would carry out the threats that José Manuel Anes, aged 81, began living with his current wife in the house of one of her friends, in Lisbon. Anes had received a threatening message from his daughter before the day of the crime and the very next day she rang the door of the house where she was living and Anes opened it, thinking it was the delivery of a package. He was immediately thrown to the ground by his daughter, who then attacked him with several punches all over his body. Then, with a sharp object, he hit him on the head, legs, hands and abdomen, until, finally, he pressed both of his eyes with his fingers, leaving him unable to see. What a macabre scene: a daughter who tries to kill an 81-year-old father, just for the sake of money. On any given day, every month we have a father killed by a son. What this has come to…

According to a note from the FRC, the aim of this session is “to bring together key voices to address a crucial question: how can Macau’s unique ecosystem be harnessed to facilitate, reduce risk, and add tangible value to this vital economic corridor”.
Co-organized by FRC and Well Link Bank Macau, the conversation will feature four guests, namely Yuri Ribeiro, founder and CEO of “Valor da China”, a consultancy and market intelligence company exclusively dedicated to Brazil-China relations, cultural understanding and international business development, based in Guangzhou.
Another guest is Alexandre Lobo, vice-rector and professor at the University of São José in Macau, presented as a “Brazilian leader in innovation, with 20 years of global experience, and who combines deep knowledge in artificial intelligence and data science, with the passion for leading transformative projects”.
The range of guests is completed by Felipe Ribeiro de Assis, associate lawyer at PK Advogados, São Paulo, with a full-service office based in Brazil, where he coordinates the “Chinese Desk”, and also Rodrigo Barbosa, co-founder and commercial director of “Modular Park Brasil”, the exclusive representative of Mussini in Brazil, specialized in metallic construction.
The moderator will be José Paulo Esperança, professor and director of international partnerships at the Faculty of Management of the City University of Macau. Former Dean of ISCTE Business School and Pro-Rector for International Relations and Entrepreneurship at ISCTE-IUL, Portugal, he holds a PhD in Economics from the European University Institute. He was also vice-president of the Foundation for Science and Technology between 2019 and 2022.
Challenges and opportunities
Today's conversation addresses the current global panorama, where, in the “world of geopolitical and economic realignment, the China-Brazil relationship presents unprecedented opportunities and complex challenges”.
Therefore, “in this new scenario, Macau’s role needs to be re-examined and redefined”, he argues. In this round table, the aim is to “translate this dialogue into action, identifying real obstacles and mapping practical paths for the integration of services in Macau, transforming its latent potential into a concrete competitive advantage”, it is said.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:45:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Netflix premieres adaptation of “The Son of a Thousand Men” in November</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/netflix-estreia-em-novembro-adaptacao-de-obra-de-o-filho-de-mil-homens/</link><description>The adaptation of the novel “The Son of a Thousand Men”, by Valter Hugo Mãe, by Brazilian director Daniel Rezende, which was shown on Monday at the International Film Festival in São Paulo, will premiere on Netflix on November 19th.
According to Porto Editora, which published the novel “O Filho de Mil Homens”, the release date of the feature film was advanced by the streaming platform. The film had its official screening this Monday, at the 49th International Film Festival in São Paulo, Brazil, one of the main cinematographic events in Latin America.
Starring Rodrigo Santoro, the film tells the story of Crisóstomo, a fisherman who finds a new meaning in life when he takes in Camilo (Miguel Martines), a young orphan. The relationship between them triggers a reflection on love, acceptance and the bonds that define the concept of family. Filmed in Búzios and Chapada Diamantina, the film is a co-production between Biônica Filmes and Barry Company, which focuses on a delicate and symbolic visual approach, highlights the publisher.
According to Netflix, it is “a fable about loneliness, love and acceptance”, which translates the emotional strength of Valter Hugo Mãe's writing into film. The cast also includes Rebeca Jamir, Johnny Massaro, Miguel Martines, Juliana Caldas, Grace Passô, Inez Viana, Lívia Silva, Antonio Haddad and Tuna Dwek.
The São Paulo film festival also showed, in its world premiere, on October 25th, the biographical documentary “De Lugar Não”, by Portuguese director Miguel Gonçalves Mendes, about Valter Hugo Mãe and his creative process, which should arrive in Portuguese cinemas in 2026.
“Intimate portrait”
The work paints an intimate portrait of Valter Hugo Mãe, following the writer over seven years, as he wrote the novel “A Dehumanização”, between trips to Iceland, Brazil, Portugal, Colombia and Macau, according to information from the Portuguese consulate in São Paulo.
The documentary, a visual meditation on loneliness, loss and belonging, features the participation of cartoonist Laerte Coutinho and Icelandic composer Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, mentor of bands such as Sigur Ros and Bjork, according to the exhibition's official page. The film “From nowhere” is part of the “The Meaning of Life” project, on which director Miguel Gonçalves Mendes has been working for more than a decade — a set of nine feature films, in a kaleidoscope of contemporary figures.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:21:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Wynn Macau | Snooker stars play this Friday</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/wynn-macau-estrelas-do-snooker-jogam-esta-sexta-feira/</link><description>The gaming and hotel venture Wynn Macau brings to the territory, this Friday, a major snooker event with the promise of having two “legends” of this sport playing.

This is a special concert, announced after the first release of the program and takes place with the musical partnership of the Macau Chinese Orchestra
The Cultural Institute (IC) announced this Monday that a concert will be held, on November 15th, with Brazilian singer Vanessa da Mata, who promises to bring the rhythms of Brazil and sing them alongside the Macau Chinese Orchestra (OCM). The show is part of the “Encounter in Macau – Festival of Arts and Culture between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries”, in its seventh year of existence. This event integrates a series of activities, including the Lusofonia Festival. The concert with the Brazilian singer is scheduled for 8pm, at the CCM Grand Auditorium, and tickets have been on sale since yesterday at the Enjoy Macao Ticket Office with prices varying between 200 and 400 patacas.
According to a note from the IC, Vanessa da Mata is described as being “one of the most influential voices in Brazilian contemporary music”, as well as a “singer and composer recognized for her artistic versatility and the emotional strength of her works”.
She is an artist with an “unmistakable voice” and a “remarkable style”, characteristics that “won over fans all over the world, making her one of the main representatives of Brazilian popular music”. Vanessa da Mata's themes combine different musical genres, namely MPB (Brazilian popular music), R&amp;B, pop, frevo, samba and reggae.
The concert on November 15th will be led by maestro Zhang Lie, music director and main conductor of the OCM, who “has led several orchestras in international performances, receiving wide acclaim from the public”.
"Under her direction, OCM will perform several emblematic songs by Vanessa da Mata, specially orchestrated for this occasion. Combining the subtlety and lyricism of traditional Chinese music with the intense and colorful rhythms of Brazil, it will offer the public a transcultural and unforgettable musical experience", the IC further describes.
Long career
Vanessa da Mata was born in 1976 and has released eight original albums. One of the best-known songs in his long repertoire is “Boa Sorte/Good Luck”, sung alongside Ben Harper, and which achieved international recognition. In this performance in Macau, it is guaranteed that Vanessa da Mata will bring “the best of Brazilian music, intersecting on stage with the charm and sonic delicacy of OCM, promising a memorable night of different sounds”.
The Brazilian singer released, in May this year, a new album, entitled “Todas Elas”, the first single of which is “Esperança”. It is a song that “proposes a reflection on the expansion of love as a whole”, it is described on the artist’s official website. Vanessa da Mata also adds that “Todas Elas” contains “more poetry” compared to previous works.
"The production is mine, the songs are all mine and will have wonderful partnerships, such as Robert Glasper, Jota.pê and João Gomes. Robert is American and considered the first jazz guy in the world, a name to watch out for. A beautiful participation by João Gomes in a song I wrote, a wonderful reggae with Jota.pê", described the artist. “Todas Elas” also gives the name to the tour that the artist has on the road.
Vanessa da Mata started singing as a teenager, in bars, having given up taking the so-called “vestibular”, the exam for access to higher education in Brazil, to pursue a career in music. He began to compose his songs, and meeting Chico César, at the age of 21, was essential for taking a step forward in his career. Vanessa da Mata's first album arrived in 2004, entitled “Essa Boneca Tem Manual”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:17:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Portuguese MP filed case against Rita Santos</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/eleicoes-mp-portugues-arquivou-caso-contra-rita-santos/</link><description>The information about the shelving of the investigation for electoral interference in the 2024 Legislatures in Portugal was provided by Canal Macau, which quotes Rita Santos herself. HM confirmed, however, the filing with the Public Ministry in Portugal
The Public Ministry (MP) will have archived the investigation targeting Rita Santos, related to the 2024 Legislative Elections in Portugal. The complaint came from some members of the Socialist Party (PS) in Macau, based on suspicions about electoral interference by the Portuguese Communities councilor. HM confirmed, however, the filing of the case with the MP.
According to Canal Macau, which cites Rita Santos, the investigation by the Portuguese MP was archived and the order containing the decision stated that “no evidence of irregularities was found” in the conduct of the target.
The order to close an investigation is issued when evidence is collected that no crime has occurred, or even if there has been a crime that was not committed by the subject of the investigation. The MP also orders the investigation to be closed if it has not been possible to obtain sufficient evidence to verify the crime or who was the perpetrator.
It was in March 2024 that information emerged that Rita Santos and the Macau Public Service Workers Association (ATFPM) were being investigated in Portugal. At the time, Portugal's National Elections Commission (CNE) revealed that it would forward complaints received about interference in Macau to the MP.
The complainants accused Rita Santos and ATFPM of having influenced voters to vote for the Democratic Alliance, the coalition that in 2024 was made up of the Social Democratic Party, CDS – Popular Party and Popular Monarchic Party and which won these elections with 28.83 percent of the votes.
Suspended mandate and local cooperation
Despite claiming to have been exonerated, the case had an impact on Rita Santos' political activity. At the beginning of October 2024, the advisor to the Portuguese Communities chose to suspend her mandate, with the newspaper Plataforma stating that the suspension was intended to avoid notification of the ongoing electoral fraud investigation. In turn, Rita Santos justified the suspension with the desire to dedicate herself to the elections for the Chief Executive in Macau, which took place on October 13, 2024, and the elections for the Legislative Assembly, which took place on September 14 of this year.
Until June of this year, ATFPM leaders, such as José Pereira Coutinho, guaranteed that Rita Santos would join the list competing with the legislative ones for the Legislative Assembly.
However, in June, Rita Santos was left out. The Macanese justified her absence with the fact that she wanted to dedicate more time to her family. However, the retreat came just a few days after the Macau Public Prosecutor's Office announced that Rita Santos had been questioned in the Macao SAR, due to a request for cooperation from the Portuguese authorities in the face of suspected irregularities during the elections.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:14:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Housing | Carlotta Bruni regrets lack of creativity in Zone A</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/habitacao-carlotta-bruni-lamenta-falta-de-criatividade-na-zona-a/</link><description>Architect Carlotta Bruni regrets that the public housing being built in Zone A of the New Landfills is not very creative. “What we see being built in Zone A are very repetitive projects, and this is a problem that has always existed in Macau.” Bruni speaks today about public housing at Casa Garden at another Docomomo Macau conference
Taking place today at Casa Garden, starting at 6:45 pm, is the conference “The advent of collective housing in the 20th century”, with architect Carlotta Bruni, an event promoted by the Docomomo Macau association.
At the Fundação Oriente headquarters in Macau, the topic of public housing and its urban functions will therefore be discussed. To HM, Carlotta Bruni regrets that the projects being built in Zone A of the New Landfills do not have the desired creativity.
Asked whether Macau is building too much public housing, the architect said “not too much, but we are building it poorly”. "It's the evil, the ugly in those buildings. It's a co-responsibility of whoever designed them and whoever commissioned them", he said, regretting that Macau had lost an opportunity to innovate in this area.
"The criticism I can make is the way these projects are developed. What we see now being built in Zone A are very repetitive projects, and the issue of having a repetitive project is a problem that has always existed in Macau. The fact that no one cares about having an ugly city", he highlighted.
For Carlotta Bruni, this ugliness aspect of housing “is something that is quite disturbing”, because “we, architects, have a mission in the world to make beautiful things, in addition to making practical, functional things that are cheap and all that”. “When looking at Zone A, currently, I honestly have to say that there was a bit of a mistake there,” he added.
“The two examples that I will discuss at the conference [Fai Chi Kei project and B10 building in Zone A] are a bit of a draw to the fact that social housing can be created in another way, with the same entities, but with more functions than the minimum indispensable.”
Living in a box
In today's talk, Carlotta Bruni “questions the spatial consequences of Macau's rapid urban densification, where the prioritization of gross built area led to the erosion of community space”, highlights a note about the conference.
In this way, the architect will “explore how architectural design can recover public and semi-public environments through the strategic placement of volumes, layered typologies and pedestrian connectivity”, highlighting “alternative spatial models that resist conventional categorization, such as open courtyards, narrow squares and elevated public areas, offering new structures for collective engagement in high-density contexts”.
Founder and director of the LBA Arquitectura &amp; Planeamento studio, Bruni will tackle some of the team's projects, namely the public housing development in Fai Chi Kei, now demolished. "Then we proposed public areas on all floors, because in Macau it is often forgotten that, when building a 30-story building, a certain detachment from the street is created. People feel that, when they leave the street, it is no longer part of their daily experience."
Carlotta Bruni regrets “the way social housing is designed in Macau, certainly with legal minimums in terms of space”. "We are designing very small apartments that then have no place where people can have a little more life. In the Fai Chi Kei building, there was, on every two floors, a very large space, with double height, so people could be outside, sit, do some exercise, for the children to meet up", he said. The Fai Chi Kei social housing neighborhood was designed by Manuel Vicente in 1977 and completed in 1981. Demolition took place in 2010.
The LBA Architect &amp; Planning studio designed the B10 social housing building in Zone A, whose construction has already been completed. There, too, the option was to create “a series of hanging gardens, with a varied location throughout the building”, creating “specific situations for each floor”, in order to build “small communities”.
The official also defended to HM that there is “a certain lack of planning” in the context of the Greater Bay Area, or at least “planning requirements”. “It is up to architects to worry about creating buildings with more interesting urban interfaces, we have to make an effort to create a more dynamic and interesting city”, he pointed out.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:11:23</pubDate></item><item><title>PJ | Indicted for kidnapping and rape of lover</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/pj-indiciado-por-sequestro-e-violacao-de-amante/</link><description>The Judiciary Police (PJ) announced the arrest of a 34-year-old man on suspicion of kidnapping, rape and serious harm to the physical integrity of his lover. The case took place in a local hotel, after the two began an extramarital relationship last year.
According to the PJ's version, the man and woman are from the interior, where they met and began a romantic relationship. However, the most recent meeting in Macau ended with the alleged commission of several crimes. After a meeting in a restaurant on Saturday morning, the woman was blackmailed into going to the man's hotel room in Macau. If she refused, the lover threatened to reveal the relationship to her husband and his entire family.
The woman eventually gave in, but when she arrived at the hotel room she was raped and kidnapped for at least an hour. After the first attack, the woman contacted her sister to ask for help and ended up being attacked, with an ashtray on her head, in addition to being strangled with a cell phone charger cable.
Given his injuries, the man allowed the victim to contact his sister, who in turn alerted the police. The suspect ended up being detained by the authorities, and when questioned by the authorities he asserted his right to silence.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:45:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Light Rail | Only two in every 100 young people use transport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/metro-ligeiro-apenas-dois-em-cada-100-jovens-utilizam-transporte/</link><description>Poor network coverage and the distance to residential areas mean that young people rarely use the metro. Among users, the main reason is the desire to have a different experience
Only 1.5 percent of young people in Macau say they use the Light Rail as their main means of transport, that is, less than two out of every 100 young people. The conclusion is part of the study prepared by the New Chinese Youth Association of Macau, the results of which were presented yesterday.
Based on a survey in which 647 young residents were questioned, aged between 18 and 44, the association concluded that the Light Rail is the least used means of transport of all those available in the territory.
When asked to answer about the main means of transport in Macau, around 36.6 percent of respondents admitted that they mainly use buses. Private vehicles, such as cars or motorcycles, were indicated as the main means of travel for 31.9 percent of young people, while 26.3 percent responded that they traveled mainly on foot. Only 1.5 percent of those questioned indicated the metro as their main means of transport.
Despite not being the main means of transport, 58.7 percent said they had used the metro at least once in the last year. However, almost seven in ten (68.4 percent) of these respondents were infrequent users, using every three months or less regularly.
The Light Rail is still considered by users as “an experience” more than a form of transport that responds to everyday needs. Regarding the reason that led young people to choose the metro, 33.9 percent said that using it was justified “just by the experience”, while 22.1 percent said they would go to a border, and 21.3 percent said they would go to large hotels.
Does not heat up or cool down
Regarding the quality of the service, the largest group of young users are indifferent, with 39.3 percent responding that it is “neither good nor bad”. Conversely, 39.1 percent stated that satisfaction is “good or very good”. The results presented by the association do not allow us to know the total degree of dissatisfaction, however, there were also 14.2 percent of respondents who indicated that the experience on the metro was “not satisfactory” or “not very satisfying”
Among young people who do not use the metro, 46.1 percent cited the fact that the “stations are too far from their homes” as the main reason, while 35.6 percent justified their non-use due to limited network coverage and 33.3 percent indicated that the metro does not provide direct access to the places they frequent most.
One of the factors that also contributes to keeping young people away is the fact that payments made through applications that use QR technology are not accepted. Around 61.7 percent stated that due to this reason they feel less desire to use this transport.
Currently, the Light Metro can be used by purchasing a ticket at ticket machines, which do not accept QR Code technology, but also at physical ticket offices. Those interested can also use the Macau Pass, passing directly through the access turnstiles.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:43:30</pubDate></item><item><title>HK | Smuggling case worth 200 million dollars discovered</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/contrabando-sete-casos-na-semana-passada/</link><description>Shark fins, cigars, cell phones, pharmaceutical products and even donkey skin. These are the products discovered in two more smuggling cases discovered by the Hong Kong Customs Service (SA) on the 3rd and 7th of this month.
According to a statement from this organization, the value of the goods is around 200 million US dollars, with two ships involved, one of them destined for river trade. This ship was destined for Macau and was caught by the authorities on October 3rd. Five containers destined for Taiwan were also inspected and were declared to be transporting frozen food. On October 7, the SA in Hong Kong realized that 150 tons of donkey skin were circulating here and not the declared food.
The same statement indicates that the investigation continues and that “the possibility of arrests is not excluded”. Under Hong Kong's Import and Export Law, anyone found guilty of importing or exporting undeclared cargo is subject to a maximum fine of US$2 million and a seven-year prison sentence upon conviction.
Seven cases last week
Taking into account the holding of the National Games starting next month, the Customs Service (SA) wants to show service and admitted to having reinforced inspection efforts at the Portas do Cerco Border Post. As a result of these efforts, seven cases of smuggling were recorded between 21 and 25 October.
According to a statement from the SA of Macau, within the scope of the seven cases, customs agents found a total of 120 old cell phones, often used to circumvent internet access limitations, 85 pieces of electronic products and 1344 grams of cigar.
The smugglers involved residents of Macau and the Interior, aged between 38 and 64 years old. Those involved were fined, the SA announced, under the provisions of the foreign trade law.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Courts | Departure of Portuguese judge confirmed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/tribunais-saida-de-juiz-portugues-confirmada/</link><description>Judge Rui Ribeiro will leave the Macao SAR courts starting next month. The information had been made public by Lusa, which cited the judge himself as a source, and was confirmed yesterday through an order, published in the Official Bulletin.
“Judge Rui Carlos dos Santos Pereira Ribeiro is dismissed, at his request, from the position of judge of the Court of Second Instance of the Special Administrative Region of Macau […] from November 1, 2025”, the document reads.
According to the news agency, Rui Ribeiro asked to return to Portugal, due to uncertainty about authorization from the Portuguese Superior Council of Judiciary (CSM) to continue in the Macao SAR. The judge has been in Macau since September 1, 2008, and in Portugal he is part of the Civil Section of the Court of Appeal of Guimarães.
Last week, the president of the CSM, João Cura Mariano, showed his willingness to send more judges to Macau, despite admitting that there is also a lack of human resources in Portugal
With Rui Ribeiro's departure, there is only one Portuguese judge left in Macau, Jerónimo Alberto Gonçalves Santos, who serves as president of a collective court at the Base Judicial Court (TJB). Jerónimo Santos has been in the Macao SAR courts since September 1, 2005, being part of the Intellectual Property, Competition, Regulation and Supervision section of the Lisbon Court of Appeal in Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:40:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Great Bay | Projected salary increases of 3% in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/grande-baia-projeccao-de-aumentos-salariais-de-3-em-macau/</link><description>In the most recent Greater Bay Area Remuneration and Benefits Survey Report 2025, 15.4 percent of 39 companies in Macau point to a salary increase of around 3 percent for 2026. The technology area is the one that pays the most to a recent graduate, with a salary of 19 thousand patacas
Some data on the salary panorama and benefits granted to workers in the context of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area 2025 are now known, thanks to a new survey released on Friday.
According to an official statement, Macau is represented by 39 companies surveyed, of which 15.4 percent expect a salary increase of three percent for next year. Meanwhile, there are “33 organizations that have not yet decided on expected salary increases”, and “no organization has indicated a salary freeze”.
Forecasts for 2026 point to a salary adjustment of 3.1 percent in management or senior positions, supervisory positions or general staff, while employees in operational or customer service roles may receive increases of 3 percent. These are nicer numbers compared to this year, whose increase percentages are around 1.3 percent and 2.9 percent depending on the different professional positions. In 2022, the year of the pandemic, salary adjustments did not exceed 1 percent, and in senior or management personnel positions there was even a drop of 0.1 percent.
Between the months of July 2024 and June 2025, there was an average salary increase of 1.6 percent in the 39 companies surveyed in Macau, while 24 reported a salary freeze. Excluding these companies that did not increase values, “the real average salary increase was, in general terms, in the remaining organizations, 3.4 percent”.
These data refer to the 2025 Greater Bay Area Remuneration and Benefits Survey Report, which in the case of Macau includes companies linked to six sectors of activity, namely hotels and restaurants, banking, insurance, finance, culture and entertainment, or even commerce and engineering. The survey covered a total of 54,195 employees in Macau.
Who pays more?
The presentation of the Survey took place last Friday at the Faculty of Business Administration of the University of Macau (UM), and was carried out by this university, the Human Resources Association of the Greater Bay Area of ​​Macau and several higher education institutions in the Greater Bay Area, including the Human Resources Strategy and Development Center of the Faculty of Administration of the Hong Kong Baptist University, among others.
Still in the case of Macau, it is highlighted that graduates in the area of ​​information technology are those with the highest salary at the beginning of their careers, in the order of 19 thousand patacas, while in Guangdong province, for the same type of work, a recent graduate earns around 6 thousand renminbis. If you have more advanced studies, such as a postgraduate degree or master's degree, the salary increases to 8,500 renminbis. In Guangdong province, the highest salaries for a recent graduate are in the area of ​​“R&amp;D”, research and development of new products, with 6,500 renminbi. Those with more advanced studies than a bachelor's degree can reach a salary of 9,500 renimbis.
In the case of Hong Kong, salaries for those just leaving university are higher in the engineering field, paying an average of 21,500 Hong Kong dollars currently.
The survey was carried out in June this year among more than three thousand companies in the Greater Bay Area, and between the months of July and September 258 valid questionnaires were received: 39 from Macao SAR, 141 from Guangdong province and 78 from Hong Kong. In total, they cover 244 thousand employees who participated through an individualized panel system using artificial intelligence, entitled “My AI Salary Consultant”.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 01:39:23</pubDate></item><item><title>ZELENSKY VS ZELENSKY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.

At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke at length and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. It says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no such thing as chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is usually used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in others. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this mistake. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who didn't love anyone./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria stayed with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely outside our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J. Pinto Fernandes emerges at the exact moment when we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but this only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows everyone else and the joy of recognizing that the yardstick of the world is not measured with my short measure and that, on the contrary, it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican for writers from the north, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thought about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché “all different, all equal”, a return to “diplomacy”, given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that “we are unified because we share the same nature” but simply highlights that we “still do not share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that quenches your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and impressive, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unresponsive to reins and containment.
Let men refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish, because of it the tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the pride of the countries will be destroyed.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert”.
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that muzzle, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relationships were restricted, or if it merely lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Ambos os poetas assanhados por uma certa ideia de santidade, foi-lhes idêntica a inabilidade de romper o cerco da pele com o transbordo em dique alheio, a mesma maldição de sublimar a concreta ferocidade de eros com a mansuetude dos versos.
Obviously, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as a hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, in a different way, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE

Helahoho! helahoho!
The poor widow's sewing machine who was bayoneted...
She sewed indefinitely in the afternoon…
The table where the old people played,
Everything mixed, everything mixed with bodies, with blood,
All one river, one wave, one dragging horror.
Helahoho! helahoho!
I unearthed the child's tin train pressed into the middle of the

And I cried like all the mothers in the world about the horror of life.
My pantheistic feet tripped over the sewing machine
[widow who was killed with a bayonet
And that poor instrument of peace stuck a spear in my heart.
Yes, I was the one to blame for everything, I was the soldier for them all
Who killed, raped, burned and broke,
It was me and my shame and my remorse like a shadow
[misshapen
They travel around the world like Ashavero,
But behind my steps there are footsteps the size of infinity
And a physical fear of being accountable to God makes me close my eyes.

I ordered, captain, to shoot the trembling peasants,
I let the daughters of all fathers tied to trees be raped,
Now I saw that it was inside my heart that all this happened,
And everything scalds and suffocates and I can't move without it
[everything be the same.
God have mercy on me, I didn't have it from anyone!

What is clear today, at this disastrous moment in which Cristiano &amp; Companhia failed in their mission in Braga, and in which the self-sabotage of Russia's gas pipelines reminds us that Putin will be willing to do anything to maintain dominance over the areas endorsed,

Sources cited by the agency indicated that the shipments have already been reserved for future dates and could be part of the “preliminary agreement” signed by Beijing and Washington last week, in Kuala Lumpur, in preparation for the high-level meeting scheduled for this Thursday, in South Korea. The acquisition could mark the resumption of soybean trade flows between the two countries, within the framework of a broader understanding between the two leaders, which includes the reversal of tariffs and restrictions imposed in recent months.
On Sunday, the US Treasury Secretary and head of the negotiating team, Scott Bessent, anticipated a strong return of Chinese purchases, guaranteeing that US farmers would be “extremely satisfied” with the terms of the agreement. Since Donald Trump reactivated the trade war with the imposition of tariffs in April, China has used soybeans as an instrument of pressure.
Despite Trump's calls “to quadruple” orders, China diversified suppliers, increasing imports from Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, investing in domestic production and even reducing the use of soybeans in livestock farming, according to consultancy Trivium.
The same consultant warned that Chinese leaders “have no interest” in returning to depend on the US for their food security and ruled out a “structural restart” of bilateral soybean trade. This month, state television CCTV indicated that the US could lose up to 16 million tonnes in exports to China if orders were not resumed by mid-November. “Losing China means losing half the market”, he pointed out.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:48:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Technology | Beijing launches plan to accelerate self-sufficiency</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/tecnologia-pequim-lanca-plano-para-acelerar-auto-suficiencia/</link><description>The Chinese Communist Party called for a national mobilization to achieve “decisive” advances in semiconductors and key technologies, on the eve of the meeting between the country's President and his North American counterpart in South Korea.
The initiative comes at a time of renewed commercial tension with the United States, marked by the increasing use of technological controls and restrictions on access to strategic materials. In the text published by the PCC, which details the priorities for the 2026-2030 five-year plan, the party calls for “extraordinary measures” to achieve technological self-sufficiency in key areas.
The official version of Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech on the plan, released yesterday by the official Xinhua news agency, highlights the need to “accelerate high-level scientific and technological self-sufficiency”. “The proposals must promote original innovation and ensure that China firmly maintains control of its growth trajectory”, stated the Chinese President, recognizing the challenges of an “increasingly adverse external environment”.
The document will serve as the basis for the preparation of the official plan by the State Council (Executive), the final version of which should be approved in March 2026. In addition to the focus on innovation, the plan proposes greater investment in “human capital”, including birth subsidies, expansion of free education, reinforcement of pensions and insurance and increased rural income.
Xi stated that these measures must be “integrated with investment in infrastructure”, to stimulate domestic consumption, a long-standing goal given the dependence on public investment and exports. Among the new priority sectors are quantum computing, unmanned aerial vehicles ('drones'), biotechnology, hydrogen and fusion energy, humanoid robots with artificial intelligence, brain-machine interfaces and 6G mobile networks. The use of artificial intelligence across industries is equally highlighted as a priority for the next five years.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:47:21</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korea | Trump does not meet with Kim Jong-un</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/coreia-do-sul-trump-nao-se-reune-com-kim-jong-un/</link><description>North American President Donald Trump clarified yesterday that he will not meet with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-un, during his current visit to the Korean peninsula, justifying it due to scheduling incompatibilities.
"I know Kim Jong-un very well. We get along very well. It really won't be possible to meet this time. [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping] arrives tomorrow [today] and that is very important for the world, for all of us", said Trump during a lunch with his South Korean counterpart, Lee Jae-myung, in the city of Gyeongjiyu.
The North American head of state added that he wants to be with the leader of North Korea and had that objective in this tour, but “there are other commitments”, although his desire is to “work hard with Kim Jong-un and the whole world to resolve things”.
Trump will return to Washington, after the meeting with the Chinese president, coinciding with the summit of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC). The current South Korean head of state, in office since June, has been more favorable to dialogue with his northern neighbor than his predecessor and praised Donald Trump's diplomatic efforts.
In his first term, the President of the United States of America met three times with Pyongyang's highest representative, between 2018 and 2019, and they both held a symbolic handshake in the demilitarized zone of the Korean peninsula, although without any practical results.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:40:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Tokyo | Japan and USA sign agreement on minerals and rare earths</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/toquio-japao-e-eua-assinam-acordo-sobre-minerais-e-terras-raras/</link><description>Trump's Asian tour included a meeting with the new leader of the Japanese Government, Sanae Takaichi. Rare earths remain at the top of the US administration's trade agenda
Tokyo and Washington signed a cooperation agreement on Tuesday in the critical minerals and rare earths sector, focusing on coordinated investments to ensure stable supplies, in a context of restrictions on exports imposed by China.
Under the terms of the agreement, signed in the capital of Japan by the country's Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, and the North American President, Donald Trump, Tokyo and Washington will collaborate in identifying projects of common interest to fill gaps in the supply chains of these materials, essential for the development of modern technology.
The two powers set a six-month deadline to “take steps to provide financial support to selected projects with the aim of generating a final product for delivery to buyers in the United States and Japan and, where appropriate, in countries with similar interests”, according to the White House.
The Japanese and North American administrations committed to serving as a bridge in promoting dialogue at a business level to advance projects that establish “new and secure” supply chains and agreed to mobilize public-private resources for the initiatives.
These resources include “grants, guarantees, loans or equity, purchase and sale agreements, insurance or regulatory facilitation”, and the projects are not limited to the processing of raw materials, but include derivative products such as permanent magnets, batteries, catalysts and optical materials.

Trump and Takaichi signed the agreement after a summit at Tokyo's Akasaka Palace, the second stop on the North American President's Asian tour, who also signed a pact in the land sector with Malaysia, a country where he previously visited. The agreements are set against the backdrop of restrictions imposed by China on exports of rare earths – a key mineral for technology, the processing and sale of which Beijing practically monopolizes – within the scope of the trade dispute with the United States.
In addition to this agreement, the heads of government of Japan and the USA signed another document in which they commit to applying the trade agreement reached in July, which set Washington's reciprocal tariffs at 15 percent and within which the fate of the 550 billion dollars that Tokyo committed to investing in the USA is still unknown.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:38:48</pubDate></item><item><title>China conducts first manned deep dive in central Arctic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/china-realiza-primeira-imersao-tripulada-em-grandes-profundidades-no-artico-central/</link><description>A team of Chinese scientists successfully completed the first manned diving expedition at great depths in the Arctic Ocean, reaching 5,277 meters under the ice, on the Gakkel Ridge, state media reported Tuesday.
The mission, lasting 56 days, was carried out aboard the research vessel Tan Suo San Hao (“Exploration #3”), built entirely in China, which transported the manned submersible Fendouzhe (“Fighter”) to carry out 43 scientific dives in the central Arctic, where ice covered more than 80 percent of the surface.
Organized by the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the expedition marks the first coordinated operation between two manned vehicles – the Fendouzhe and the Jiaolong – in a polar environment, establishing a model of cooperation for future scientific missions in regions of dense ice. According to the official press, this is the first manned scientific exploration at great depth in the central Arctic, an area where extreme pressure and temperature conditions have historically made underwater operations difficult.
During the mission, scientists collected samples of water, sediments, rocks and marine organisms, as well as observational data that will contribute to the study of the effects of climate change in polar regions. “The expedition demonstrates that China already has the technological and logistical capacity to carry out manned diving operations continuously in areas with dense ice,” state television CCTV said.
Ice dives
Launched in 2021, Tan Suo San Hao is the first Chinese scientific vessel designed for global deep-sea exploration missions. The Arctic mission departed on July 22 from the coastal city of Sanya, on the tropical island of Hainan, and ended this week with the crew's return to China.
China thus asserts itself as the first country to carry out deep and continuous manned dives under dense ice in the central Arctic, reinforcing its scientific presence in one of the regions most sensitive to global warming.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:35:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Foxconn | Investment of almost 1.2 ME in AI and supercomputing centers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/foxconn-investimento-de-quase-12-me-em-centros-de-ia-e-de-supercomputacao/</link><description>Technology company Foxconn announced on Tuesday an investment of up to 42 billion Taiwan dollars to acquire equipment for the construction of a supercomputing center and a computing center for artificial intelligence.
In a statement sent to the Taipei Stock Exchange, where it is listed, the company indicated that the investment will be made between December 2025 and December 2026, using its own funds. According to Foxconn, the operation aims to “expand the cloud computing services platform and accelerate the development of the group's three main intelligent platforms”.
Founded in 1974, the Foxconn group is the world's largest contract manufacturer of electronic devices, with factories and research and development centers in China, India, Japan, Vietnam and the United States, among others. Like other technology companies, Foxconn has benefited in recent months from optimism surrounding the potential of AI, having become one of the main manufacturers of GB200 servers from North American Nvidia.
In the second quarter, the company recorded net profits of 44,361 million Taiwan dollars (1,242 million euros), vastly exceeding analysts' forecasts and representing year-on-year growth of 27 percent.
The Taiwan-based manufacturer has made the production of servers for AI one of its main bets and estimates that sales of this equipment will exceed one billion Taiwanese dollars (28,017 million euros) this year, which would represent half of its total server business.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:32:07</pubDate></item><item><title>China records record numbers in 2025 with one new billionaire per day</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/china-regista-numero-recorde-em-2025-com-um-novo-multimilionario-por-dia/</link><description>China recorded a record increase in the number of billionaires in 2025, with a new entry every day, driven by the appreciation of stock markets and the rise of companies in the so-called “new economy”, according to the Hurun research unit.
The latest edition of the “Hurun China Rich List” includes 1,434 individuals with fortunes exceeding five billion yuan, 340 more than last year, representing a growth of 31 percent. The combined wealth of these billionaires totals 30 billion yuan, an increase of 42 percent compared to the previous year.
At the top of the list was Zhong Shanshan, founder of bottled water producer Nongfu Spring, whose fortune soared 56 percent to 530 billion yuan. It is the fourth time that Zhong has led the ranking. Zhang Yiming, founder of ByteDance – the company that owns TikTok – fell to second place, despite increasing his fortune by 34 percent, to 470 billion yuan.
Li Ka-shing, 97, and his son Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, 61, remain the richest in Hong Kong, with a combined fortune of 235 billion yuan, 18 percent more than last year, although they have fallen from sixth to ninth place in the overall table.
The Hurun investigative unit has been compiling this list since 1999, covering billionaires from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. “This year's list surprised by reaching a record number, driven above all by the strong performance of stock markets and the emergence of new figures in the technology and export sectors”, said Rupert Hoogewerf, president of Hurun.
Stocks on the rise
The number of fortunes above 100 billion yuan rose from 26 to 41, an increase of 59 percent. The total number of people with assets above one billion dollars increased by 36 percent, to 1,021. The appreciation of shares in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong reflected investor enthusiasm for sectors such as electric vehicles, biotechnology and computing. The Shenzhen index rose 54 percent and the Shanghai index 36 percent through September. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 42 percent.
China's GDP grew 4.8 percent in the third quarter, less than the 5.2 percent recorded in the previous quarter. Trade tensions with the United States and problems in the real estate sector continue to weigh on the economic recovery.
Still, Chinese companies with global ambitions – especially in the areas of batteries, healthcare and mining – have attracted market interest. By the end of September, 66 companies (mostly from mainland China) raised US$23.27 billion through initial public offerings on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the largest figure in the world this year.</description><pubDate>2025-10-30 02:29:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Beijing confirms meeting between Xi Jinping and Trump</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/30/diplomacia-pequim-confirma-reuniao-entre-xi-jinping-e-trump/</link><description>Xi Jinping and Donald Trump meet today in the South Korean capital ahead of the APEC summit. On the table, there must be topics such as rare earths, tariffs, Tik-Tok or the Taiwan issue. Chinese diplomacy confirmed yesterday that President Xi Jinping will meet today with his North American counterpart, Donald Trump, in South Korea, in a meeting aimed at easing trade tension between the two countries.
Although Washington had already confirmed the meeting – with Trump already present in South Korea yesterday – Beijing has remained silent until now, in what will be the first meeting between the two leaders since the Republican's return to the White House, last January.
The meeting will take place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) summit and should address topics such as the trade war, the TikTok application, the Taiwan issue and the fight against fentanyl trafficking.
In recent days, both sides have signaled a willingness to compromise. Trump expressed confidence in a “good-for-both trade deal” and admitted lowering tariffs on China in exchange for greater cooperation in the fight against fentanyl, the drug responsible for a public health crisis in the USA. He was also evasive about the possibility of discussing Taiwan with Xi, stating: “Taiwan is Taiwan.”
Follow up
The meeting follows technical negotiations held in Kuala Lumpur, in which Washington and Beijing reached a “preliminary agreement” to ease trade disputes, including Chinese controls on rare earth exports and US tariffs on Chinese products.
On Tuesday, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party published new strategic guidelines that call for a national mobilization to achieve “decisive breakthroughs” in key technologies such as semiconductors, precision tools, basic software, artificial intelligence and fusion energy, under the 2026-2030 five-year plan.
On the diplomatic level, tension around Taiwan gained new momentum ahead of the summit. Beijing reiterated that it will “never renounce the use of force” to achieve reunification, while Taiwanese leader William Lai stated that “only peace through force” can guarantee regional stability and called for firmer opposition to Chinese “annexation”.
In recent days, China has also intensified military activity around the island, with dozens of combat planes crossing the midline of the Taiwan Strait.
For the worse, that's all it takes
Donald Trump yesterday expressed optimism about the possibility of reaching a new trade agreement with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, stating that “it is better to reach an understanding than to be in conflict”. "I hope we can reach an agreement. I believe it will be a good agreement for both of us. That would be a really excellent result," said Trump, during a speech before businesspeople at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, in the South Korean city of Gyeongju.
"This is better than being in confrontation and going through all kinds of problems unnecessarily. The whole world is watching", added the North American leader, on the eve of the meeting with Xi. In statements aboard the presidential plane Air Force One, Trump also admitted the possibility of reducing current tariffs on China, as long as this helps to intensify the fight against fentanyl trafficking, one of the main priorities of the meeting with Xi.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>MNE | Beijing calls for “mutual respect” after German minister’s visit is canceled</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/28/mne-pequim-pede-respeito-mutuo-apos-cancelamento-da-visita-do-ministro-alemao/</link><description>The Chinese Government defended yesterday that China and Germany must maintain relations based on “mutual respect, equal treatment and mutually beneficial cooperation”, after the postponement of a visit by the German Foreign Minister. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun declared, at a press conference, that Beijing “has always developed ties with Berlin from a strategic and long-term perspective”.
Guo stressed that, as “large countries and leading world economies”, China and Germany maintain a “mutually beneficial” cooperative relationship. “Under the current circumstances, both parties must continue to push their ties in the right direction,” he added.
The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed last week the postponement of Johann Wadephul's visit, scheduled for October 28th and 29th, after the Chinese side did not confirm further meetings beyond the meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.
German diplomacy spokeswoman Kathrin Deschauer expressed Berlin's “great concern” about the restrictions imposed by Beijing on the export of certain components used in the production of semiconductors and rare earth materials, measures that raised alarm in the German automotive industry.
Trade tensions between the two countries intensified after the intervention of the Dutch State in the chip manufacturer Nexperia, a subsidiary of the Chinese Wingtech, which led Beijing to restrict exports of crucial components for the sector. The ban is generating concern among the Volkswagen Group, Europe's largest car manufacturer.</description><pubDate>2025-10-28 02:07:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Cuca Roseta, fado singer: “Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/06/cuca-roseta-fadista-o-fado-e-um-samba-poesia-cantado-vindo-do-coracao/</link><description>During the pandemic, she sang for the Macau public through a video concert, but now, the fado singer gives her heart and soul to a concert with the Macau Chinese Orchestra, part of the lineup for the Macau International Music Festival, next Saturday, 11th. In an interview with HM, Cuca Roseta talks about the show's lineup, her 15-year career and the truth found in her compositions.
Performs in Macau on October 11th with the Macau Chinese Orchestra (OCM). Tell me a little about what we can expect from this show.
Yes, we are finally going to Macau. Vai ser a primeira vez porque fizemos anteriormente um vídeoconcerto para Macau na pandemia, e não conseguimos estar aí fisicamente. Actuamos agora com a OCM, que é muito boa, e estou feliz com essa parceria, por poder unir, de alguma forma, duas culturas. We are a little anxious about that fact.
The concert will have songs such as “Meu”, “Preto e Branco”, “Canção do Mar”, “Não Sei de Onde” and “Finalmente”. What does this alignment bring us?
We already had arrangements made for orchestra by Marinho de Freitas, which are extraordinary arrangements, and which will be adapted to the traditional OCM instruments. These songs are practically all written by me, lyrics and music, and tell different stories, some that I have lived myself or stories that, in some way, I have experienced someone living very closely. They are original fados. “Canção do Mar” is very old and became known in the voices of Dulce Pontes and Amália Rodrigues, and has a new arrangement. We thought it would look beautiful with OCM. Of course, there are songs that we always sing and that never leave the repertoire, linked to traditional phases of my career. There are some songs that people like and request, but we bring a completely different repertoire to what we presented at the time [in Macau, with the video concert], which was very well received. It was a concert that went very well, even though it was via video, and we received wonderful messages.
This year he released the album “Até a Fé Se Esqueceu”, which has an exclusively Brazilian repertoire, with several names in Brazilian music, such as Seu Jorge or Zeca Pagodinho. Why explore this universe, mixing it with the language of Fado?
Yes, but this year I will also release a French album with Amália Rodrigues' agent, who invited me. But “Até a Fé Se Esqueceu” came from an invitation from a great Brazilian producer to record old sambas, which have a lot to do with Fado. Even though it's a Brazilian album, all sambas, it's my saddest album of all, the most melancholic. That's why we went looking for this root of samba to find great poets and great composers that Brazil has, and who have this weight that Fado also has.
As?
Fado has a lot to do with words and composition, in fact, Fado is samba-poetry sung from the heart, because there has to be this truth in the interpretation, the idea of ​​truth coming from life's experiences, in transforming the story it tells. This melancholy is in the veins of Portuguese blood and is mixed with art and music. This invitation wanted to put a fado singer to sing seriously and with the weight that Fado brings, and be able to interpret the great poets and sambas. The album [Até a Fé Se Esqueceu] has very old sambas, one of them from 1937. It is, therefore, a very strong and even very beautiful album, with great poems and composers, such as Tom Jobim, Vinicius de Morais, and wonderful partnerships with Seu Jorge and Zeca Pagodinho, who came to Fado. It's an album that made me really proud.

Therefore, it is possible to marry Fado with the joy of samba, which also has a melancholic side, right? Like the melancholy of our Fado.
In fact, when we hear the word samba we think of joy, but in fact the basis of samba is not joy. There is that phrase by Vinicius de Morais, “To make a samba beautifully you need a bit of sadness, otherwise you won’t make a samba”. So that's where the beauty of this work lies, which goes to the roots of samba and shows that there aren't that many differences between the melancholy at the root of samba and the melancholy of Fado. It's a nostalgic and melancholic album, it doesn't bring that joy. It can bring hope, and we can say that some themes bring with them this hope, which we find in Brazilian culture and drums. Because they literally put their sadness on the skirt wheel and on the drums, right? They transform sadness into dance and music, but in this work we don't see that type of samba.
Cuca also has a previous album, “Cabo Verde Nha Cretcheu”, so it can be said that she has explored, in her career, the different Portuguese-speaking sounds, going beyond Fado, mixing sounds?
This album didn't come from my will, and I think [it's a sign] that life takes me, deep down. This album was born from a tour I took across the nine islands of Cape Verde with a live recording of the mornas I sang on each island, as I sang the traditional mornas of each island. Between one island and another there are very different moraines. What I did was, after my Fado concerts, I sang two mornas and then we compiled all the songs in Creole in celebration of the fact that I was the first international artist to do the nine islands in a row. But I was also in Goa and did my concert in Concanim. I find it easy and enjoy learning the traditional songs of the countries where I am going to sing. I already sang in Moscow and learned a Russian song; I learned the songs of Goa, and in Georgia, in Tblisi, I also learned a song. It's a treat I make when I travel around the world taking Fado. But morna is wonderful and there really are similarities between this musical genre, and I wanted to bring this encounter between Fado and morna to Cape Verdeans, and this album came about, which is beautiful.
Once it goes to Macau, can we expect a song in Cantonese, or Mandarin?
Yes. By chance, I had already spoken to my manager to contact someone in this regard, so that we could discover a traditional song that I could learn.
Last year, he celebrated 15 years of career. How do you review your career, which began with the albums “Cuca Roseta” and “Raiz”?
In fact, it was great to celebrate 15 years at MEO Arena [the concert hall in Lisbon], and be able to revisit all the albums since the first. “Raiz” opened something that is rarer, which is the fado singer composing and writing her lyrics. This was a record that went wonderfully well and, from then on, it was good, because in this search for the truth that Fado has, being able to compose and write your own lyrics always means giving a little more of yourself. Each person composes and writes in their own way, and when they can do it, it is always a bit like the lines on the palm of their hand, that is, it is something unique. In this search that people make to follow standards to achieve success, I believe that success exists when we are not afraid to follow our voice and our instinct, what comes from our heart, tell our stories and sing our melodies without fear. In this way we end up becoming unique. Although it is not usual in Fado for a fado singer to compose and write, it was nice to see that my songs became important to many fans. Sometimes I have great composers and poets [to collaborate with me], but I think [writing and composing] brings out this side of the person being more truthful. My poems can never be compared to those of the great poets I have sung, but I think people feel that I am more in my own skin. In a way, this touches and moves them. Celebrating 15 years of career was the closing of a cycle and the beginning of another, and it was great to return to the “roots”, and realize that that was where the “gunpowder” lay, in the sense of not being afraid of ourselves.</description><pubDate>2025-10-06 05:24:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Hui So-ying, protagonist of the film “Ah Ying”: “Representing is being human”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/30/hui-so-ying-protagonista-do-filme-ah-ying-representar-e-ser-se-humano/</link><description>Em 1983, o cinema de Hong Kong, pela lente de Allen Fong, revelou “Ah Ying”, um filme que retrata a vida dura de uma menina que vende peixe no mercado e sonha ser actriz. That girl was Hui So-ying and “Ah Ying” was inspired by her life. HM spoke to the actress on the sidelines of “Making Waves – 2nd Hong Kong Cinema Exhibition”, which took place this weekend in Lisbon
 
How did you get involved in this film project?
The main reason I got involved in this film was because my theater teacher passed away. So I felt like I needed to do something to honor him, because he was the one who taught me how to act. So I tried to be an actress. Later, when [director] Allen Fong met me, he found my life story interesting, and he also ended up meeting some of my family members. Then he asked if they were also interested in participating in the film, which led to many of them also ending up joining the project. The film also shows the environment in which my teacher lived, it is a portrait of experiences and stories lived by me and my teacher.
The film portrays life in Hong Kong in those times. How did you prepare for the character?
The beauty of this film is closely related to the collaborations that were made, particularly in photography and costumes. It took many collaborations to create the beauty that exists in the film. It was hard work taking on the character [of Ah Ying], because the story was designed to describe some of my past experiences, and that's what the director wanted to do. But that was difficult for me, because there were some things I didn't want to face, but I had to. Of course, I later realized that, deep down, it was nothing, and I even felt relieved after finishing filming. Thinking about whether the story was a form of art or reality, when I was performing, I had to enter the situation of the moment because, in fact, the [real] episode had already passed, but I had to have certain feelings again during the performance. As an actress, it was a big test.
“Ah Ying” is considered one of the great films of the so-called “New Wave” of Hong Kong cinema. During the screening, did you expect the film to be successful?
I didn't think about it, but throughout the project I thought that Allen Fong was a very daring director, because a film of this kind had never been made in the entire history of Hong Kong cinema. It's a kind of “docudrama”, and he had the strength and courage to innovate the way he filmed it, which, at the time, was unprecedented.
What was the biggest challenge you faced in this film?
It was having to return to my old self. There were things I didn't want to face and I had to face them again, with the same feeling I had at that time.
Many years have passed between 1983 and the present. Looking back, what meaning did this film have for you, as a person and actress?
In fact, after seeing the film, I saw it as just a story. For me, acting is being human, every day is a performance.
The film portrays life in Hong Kong in the 1980s and has received a restored version. What do you think this project can bring to a younger audience watching the film today?
This year the film was shown several times, and I always ask the same question, whether people don't understand the film or whether they think it can't be immersive enough. In fact, given my experience, most younger viewers responded that this is not the case, that the film is quite real. I don't think this film is outdated or out of fashion just because times have progressed or society has changed. I don't think so.
“Ah Ying” closed, in Lisbon, the second edition of “Making Waves – Hong Kong Film Festival”. How do you feel about seeing this film shown in Portugal?
I found it interesting. I never thought that the film could be shown at this exhibition, I don't know if it was because there was a restored copy. Before this new version it was more difficult to display it. The public can see a film that shows family relationships experienced in the 80s, and I think that the film can be immersive [in the theme], when it addresses family conflicts, because everyone has a family. Watching the film, you may wonder what your relationship with your family is like. Of course, I also hope you learned more about Hong Kong. But, despite this film taking place in the 80s, it focuses a lot on family and interpersonal relationships.
Is there an episode from filming that left an impression on you?
There were several moments throughout the film, but the one that left the biggest impression on me was the last scene, in the interview, in which I was talking to a chair, but it was as if I were talking to my teacher. When I see this scene again I am always moved, because my teacher has already passed away, but all of this still makes a huge impression on me.</description><pubDate>2025-09-30 00:42:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Jorge Figueira, architect and academic at the University of Coimbra: “The heroic relationships” of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/03/jorge-figueira-arquitecto-e-academico-da-universidade-de-coimbra-as-relacoes-heroicas-de-macau/</link><description>He has been writing and thinking about architecture for a long time, and Jorge Figueira, architect and academic at the University of Coimbra, has been doing so in Macau since then. After a session this week in which he highlighted the former Fai Chi Kei public housing complex, by Manuel Vicente, Jorge Figueira addresses the legacy of Nuno Portas today at the Rui Cunha Foundation
 
Participate today in the conference “Nuno Portas: from Architecture to Urbanism, from Man to City”. What legacy did this Portuguese architect leave?
Nuno Portas is someone who, at the end of the 50s, had a critical activity that was completely innovative and pioneering in the Portuguese context. Then, in the 60s, he had a more international activity, having been the first to publicize the work of Siza Vieira. It was there that he had his first contacts with Spanish and Italian architects, mainly. During those years he also wrote two books that were also unusual, such as “Architecture for Today”, in 1964, and “City as Architecture”, in 1969. They were also an extraordinary way of trying to understand what was happening in terms of international currents in architecture. But later he also had an [important] activity as an architect alongside Nuno Teotónio Pereira, namely in the work on the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in Lisbon, and in a house in Vila Viçosa. Then, on April 25, 1974, he was appointed Secretary of State for Housing and Urbanism and launched SAAL – Outpatient Services for Local Support, a completely revolutionary social housing program, in keeping with the spirit of the time. Afterwards, Nuno Portas dedicated himself more to urban planning issues and not so much to architecture. He was linked to the beginning of Expo 98. He ended up being someone who, in the last 20 years of his work, began to have more scientific and sociological concerns, and less artistic ones. It's something he had from the beginning, but later it became the center of his activity.
Did Nuno Portas have any relationship with Macau?
I think that the relationships would not be as intense compared to other architects and contexts, but we know that Nuno Portas was in Macau at the invitation of the Government for a conference, between 2001 and 2002. It is interesting because from this passage we have echoes of what happened, such as his surprise when discovering Manuel Vicente's Ellen Liang orphanage, which he did not know about. It was Manuel Vicente's first work in Macau, in the 60s, and we know that Nuno Portas was moved when visiting this work, especially the small chapel that exists in the orphanage. It's interesting because there was no direct relationship between Manuel Vicente and Nuno Portas, they are figures at very different poles, and even opposites. There is also an interesting and positive reference to the Siza plan [Vieira, Plano de Expansão da Cidade de Macau (Areia Preta e Porto Exterior, 1982), which is being built when Nuno Portas visits Macau. It is interesting that he commented on this plan because in the 60s and 70s the relationship between Nuno Portas and Siza Vieira was no longer the same, and the fact that he made complimentary references to Siza is very interesting.
He was a student of Nuno Portas. What other aspects of your career or personality can you highlight?
I also worked with him. He was a cultured man, very intelligent and with an overwhelming memory. He was someone who liked to provoke, but in a good way, to argue, to contradict. I was lucky enough to maintain a decades-long dialogue with him, and it is this personal knowledge that I will pass on. I also notice that he was a man very close to the power in Lisbon, to the parties, but always very independent. He was a personal friend of Jorge Sampaio, he was Secretary of State, but he never had a major political role. On the one hand, this is due to his independence, but on the other he was such a controversial and intelligently restless figure, that I think power was also scared of him.
This week he also spoke at the conference “Lisbon, Porto, Macau, Maputo: Heroic Collective Housing from the 60s &amp; 70s”. How do you describe Macau’s public housing projects in those years?
There are many architects I could talk about, but I focused on the work of Manuel Vicente in Macau, namely the public housing complex in Fai Chi Kei, which was demolished and later gave rise to the project by Rui Leão and Carlota Bruni. I didn't specifically talk about Portuguese or Macanese architects, we also have names like, for example, José Maneiras. Especially because Portuguese architects have always been few in Portugal, and from the 1950s there were around 150, later increasing greatly in number. But I paid [at the conference] a tribute to the Portuguese architects who built during that period, because in a complex territory and with its vicissitudes, different from those that existed in Portugal, they knew how to carry out extraordinary architectural experiments in the field of public housing. I tried to demonstrate what was happening in Lisbon, Porto, Macau and Lourenço Marques, now Maputo, in different ways. In Macau, relationships were established, which I call heroic, in the sense that they were relationships of experimental architecture, in which people had to adapt, have their own spirit. These are architectures that already have a bit of history, as 50 or 60 years have passed, but the examples we find in these cities continue to be remarkable.
What projects do you highlight from these years?
I spoke about the “Pantera Cor-de-Rosa” housing development, by Gonçalo Byrne, in Chelas, Lisbon. I showed “Cinco Fingers”, by Vítor Figueiredo, also from Lisbon, and “Bairro da Bouça”, by Siza Vieira, in Porto. I showed the Fai Chi Kei complex, by Manuel Vicente, and a project by Pancho Guedes in Mozambique. Despite being distant in time, these are architectures that remain fundamental references from a cultural and architectural point of view. There is a kind of narrative luck in being able to talk about such different places, and with such different architects, and show how they had this heroic, experimental, moving, even radical side that the architecture of that period in particular had.
Has Macau had a positive evolution with regard to the supply of public housing?
I arrived in August and have been visiting the territory in recent years, so I have been following this process a little. Macau is, obviously, an extraordinary territory and due to the coexistence of very different cultures when it comes to housing, which here has a scale and expression completely different from that of Portugal. In Portugal there is an aversion to public housing towers, it has always been something unusual and the results that are known have not been successful for various reasons. But in Macau this is exactly what we see, public housing in towers and with a very strong expression. This has to do with the characteristics of the territory and also with a certain culture in China and Hong Kong. This does not mean that everything being built in Macau is good, there are towers and buildings with less interesting solutions or that result from a certain repetition. But there is no city that only has good architecture or good public housing. The challenge is to solve the housing problem on a large scale, something that must be studied and thought about. It is beautiful and overwhelming to see that Macau is a territory that grows day after day and it is exciting to observe this from an architectural point of view as well. That's what I'm doing, working on future projects.
Analysis projects, or academic ones?
Yes, I'm a professor and researcher at the University of Coimbra and a columnist for the Público newspaper, so my job is to analyze and investigate. I've already published a lot about Macau and I want to go back to some points that I left unresolved, so to speak. I am very encouraged by everything I have seen and the people I have spoken to, and perhaps I will increase my work on the territory from an academic and research point of view.
At a time when Portugal has a chronic housing problem, with a lack of public housing, could Macau be an example?
Not directly, because of the typological issue of the housing tower. It might not be a welcome model in the Portuguese context. But without a doubt, Portugal needs to learn from other experiences and other territories and needs to find solutions. Certainly, what is happening in Hong Kong and Macau are experiences that are very interesting to know, not to replicate, but to understand that this is a global problem [the lack of housing].
Remember Nuno Portas
The Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC) will host today, starting at 6:30 pm, the conference “Nuno Portas: from architecture to urbanism, from man to city”, with Jorge Figueira. It will be time to talk about a journey that the recently deceased architect began in 1959, with a text about the new generation of the Modern Movement in Portugal. Texts followed in the 60s and 70s with “scientific approaches”, with Nuno Portas wandering between architecture and urbanism, always in a reflective way. Nuno Portas was a “multifaceted figure, best known for launching the SAAL social housing program, which is still the subject of research and an example today”, describes Jorge Figueira in a note. The speaker is linked to the Center for Social Studies and the Department of Architecture of the University of Coimbra.</description><pubDate>2025-09-03 23:33:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, academic: “China is reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended her doctoral thesis at the University of Aveiro that analyzes how China has positioned itself, in recent decades, as an important actor in “Global Health Governance”. Today, Beijing is looking for “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “Global South” and is trying to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let’s start with the concept of global health governance (GGS). Is it a more contemporary concept or one related to the post-World War II period and the founding of the World Health Organization (WHO)? Who have been the main actors in this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance has grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and global interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, requiring multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, it has only been since the 1990s that greater awareness has been made of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by Western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors in this governance, until the rise of China, were historically marked by interventions from entities such as the WHO and non-governmental organizations, predominantly North American and European.
One of the conclusions of his doctoral thesis is that China has gradually positioned itself in this leadership. When and why did this positioning begin?
Yes, China has progressively positioned itself as a key player in the evolution of the GGS system. Although it is not possible to pinpoint an exact start date, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a major player in the global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in the historical dynamics of the GGS, as in the 1960s China tried to play a role in humanitarian health assistance in neighboring countries and in Africa. The thesis highlights that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a State chooses its own path instead of a pre-established model, aligning with the prediction of the 21st century as the “Asian Century”.
Did the years of the pandemic influence this position? In what way?
The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of failing to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Road before and after the pandemic, indicating that the years of the pandemic allowed for greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Road as platforms for more effective cooperation between Nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic has intensified China's role in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health sector, which ones do you highlight as the most important?
In the thesis, I address the reforms of China's healthcare system and highlight that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of market-oriented economic reforms and state-led development, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism in political issues in general, with the healthcare sector being no different from the rest. One of China's contributions mentioned, recognized by the WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors”. Furthermore, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which include primary healthcare reforms, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious benchmark for China's domestic health reforms, also covering social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to the WHO, or simply to create an alternative movement that can coexist with the WHO, in the context of its relationship with the Global South? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a “dual approach”: while integrating into existing global structures, it simultaneously forges alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as the BRICS and partnerships with the Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist with and complement the role of the WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to aligning the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, showing its willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the cooperation mechanisms already existing in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's vision of a “Community of Shared Future for Humanity”, which includes the notion of “Global Health Community for All”, also points to a new perspective in the scope of international cooperation.
Masks, vaccines and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM): what products or instruments are used by China to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis highlights that China is an indispensable provider of global public health goods, essential for the supply chain of products, such as masks and vaccines. TCM is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its treatments derived from Chinese herbs, some of which were already recognized by the WHO in 2017. Furthermore, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to the WHO, could China be taking advantage of the lack of full representation in that same WHO, or gaps in its functioning?
The thesis does not directly address whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representation in the WHO or gaps in its functioning. However, she emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge regarding the health governance paradigm from a non-Western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor in the Global South. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized solutions to health challenges, different from those advocated by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union's (EU) foreign policy towards China affected or influenced the country's position in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled “Challenges on the European Union-China cooperation in higher education from ‘people-to-people dialogue’ perspective: The case of health-related joint projects”, explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that which includes projects related to health. It appears, therefore, that, despite strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of EU-China bilateral relations has intensified, with the Commission assuming a decline in enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU sanctions on human rights, economic coercion and trade measures against the single market, and China's position in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader framework of building a strategic partnership between the EU and China. However, it is clear that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between the EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general picture. It is suggested that both the EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without a pandemic, what could China's role be in global health governance?
Although the thesis will be published this year, it focuses on the period leading up to and including the pandemic, where I do not directly speculate on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without a pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant but a moderate reformist force in shaping global health norms. Regardless of future political scenarios, its growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, domestic reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Road will continue to shape its role in global health governance. The vision of a “Global Health Community for All” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in the GGS occur more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance is manifested through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with an increasing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen its role in the Global South and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Road indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist activist, 34 years old, physical engineer, Romani national.

Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied the right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on staying, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
The gentlemen we are talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP Macau | Entry lists presented did not disappoint</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/16/gp-macau-listas-de-inscritos-apresentadas-nao-desapontaram/</link><description>Last Monday, the Organizing Committee of the Macau Grand Prix presented the 72nd edition of the biggest sporting event in the territory. In total, there will be seven grids of GT, touring cars, single-seaters and motorcycles that will provide, between qualifying races and races, a total of eleven unpredictable battles for victory in the always charismatic and world-respected Guia Circuit
The Macao SAR will have 19 riders in total, spread across four races in the program, as it will not have riders in either the GT race, the Motorcycle Grand Prix or the Guia Race. O território estará representado por Charles Leong Hon Chio no Grande Prémio de Macau – Taça do Mundo de FR da FIA. The champion of this season's PRO class of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia moves on to Formula Regional, a category that has not been raced since 2020, when it was still called F3 (!) in Asia.
Tiago Rodrigues, in his third participation in the event, and Marcus Cheong, in his second, will defend the colors of the Macao SAR in the first edition of the F4 World Cup, a race that will feature seven former F4 champions or equivalent. The rest of the territory's delegation will compete in the GT Cup – Great Bay Race, with seven drivers, and in the Macau Roadsport Challenge, with nine.
We have to go back to the beginning of the 1970s to find such a low presence of Portuguese drivers in a Grand Prix. In addition to young Tiago Rodrigues, veterans of the territory Rui Valente and Jerónimo Badaraco will be present, both in the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. The universe of Lusophony is completed with the Brazilian Ethan Nobels, who will make his debut at the Guia Circuit in the F4 race.
Portugal's last representation in the race dates back to the 2022 Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix, when André Pires and Sheridan Morais overcame mandatory confinement, with Morais achieving a podium, a unique feat for Portuguese motorcycling. In cars, the last participation was in 2019, when Tiago Monteiro drove a Honda Civic Type-R TCR in the Guia Race.
Interestingly, at a time when there is an increase in female participation in motorsport events worldwide, there is not a single lady among the more than one hundred and sixty drivers registered in the Grand Prix.
Mercedes smudges the paint
After two years with pelotons with two dozen GT3 cars, the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup is once again below that benchmark number. Fortunately, the sixteen cars from six different manufacturers, including the returning McLaren, will be driven by drivers with world-class credentials. Well-known names from Macau, such as Edoardo Mortara or Raffaele Marciello, joined by the new hero of Chinese motorsport, the winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Ye Yifei, alleviate any disappointments. If Audi Sport Asia, at a time when the Ingolstadt brand is disinvesting in GT races, had backed down, we would have fewer cars than in the 2018 edition, where only fifteen machines lined up.
The introduction of torque sensors in this year's race – a costly decision made entirely by the FIA ​​– was at the heart of Mercedes-AMG's decision not to participate in the event. The German brand's business model involves registering cars in partnership with teams from the region at the event. In Southeast Asia, cars are constantly on the move via containerized transport, leaving little opportunity for conversion work and sensor testing, which is imperative for Mercedes-AMG. Everyone is certain that the Stuttgart brand will return to the Guia Circuit in the near future, but this year Maro Engel will not be able to defend the crown won last year.
Classics maintain their aura
With Michael Rutter's absence confirmed, there was a lot of apprehension about the entry list for the Motorcycle Grand Prix, but the presence of Davey Todd, last year's winner, and Peter Hickman will keep the race on the international radar. Twelve countries, all European, will be represented on a grid that this year will feature four newcomers, while of the four brands present, BMW and Honda make up more than 70% of the twenty entries.
Notably, no rider competes on a Kawasaki, marking the first time this decade that the company, which next year celebrates 130 years since its founding, has not had a presence in Asia's premier motorcycle road race.
At a time when Tourist racing is experiencing a less vigorous moment worldwide, the Guia Race already has twenty-four cars registered, three of which will still have to be filled by drivers to be nominated. The presence of the stars of the FIA ​​TCR World Tour, which is once again decided on the local circuit, is always synonymous with a good show on the track.</description><pubDate>2025-10-16 02:48:16</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau: First names and first questions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/10/gp-macau-primeiros-nomes-e-primeiras-duvidas/</link><description>October is usually the month of preparations for the Macau Grand Prix. With the championships coming to an end all over the world, attention turns to the Macao SAR's big event, which this year will take place from the 13th to the 16th of November
 
After Marcos Cheong and Vernice Lau raced in the Chinese Formula 4 Championship race, this weekend it is Tiago Rodrigues' turn to pick up the helmet again to compete in the closing race of the Chinese competition season, on the circuit in the neighboring city of Zhuhai. The former Chinese champion of the discipline has been away from single-seater racing since participating in the Middle East Formula 4 Championship at the beginning of the year, but his experience could prove to be an asset in defending the territory's colors at the Guia Circuit.
Twenty of the Mygale M21-F4 single-seaters from the Chinese championship will be overhauled after this race at the Zhuhai International Circuit and handed over to technicians appointed by the French Motor Sport Federation (FFSA), who will put them on the track in the first edition of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup, in Macau. This is the same model used in the French Formula 4 Championship.
Some names of the bikes
Michael Rutter's absence from the entry list for this year's Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix is ​​now a certainty. However, through the specialized press, the first names that will shape the only road race on the Asian continent are beginning to become known.
Practically confirmed are the presence of Davey Todd, winner of last year's edition, and Peter Hickman, the motorcyclist who chases Rutter's record of victories and who should be practically recovered from the injuries suffered in the accident on the Isle of Man. Both will drive the official competitive BMW M1000RR from 8TEN Racing. Rob Hodson, SMT Racing driver, has also guaranteed his presence in the Macao SAR, usually being one of the strong candidates for the Top 5 in the race.
But not only renowned names are tested. Among the debutants already confirmed is ramp driver Maurizio Bottalico. The San Marino driver, who reached the podium at the Manx Grand Prix, follows in the footsteps of other great Italian names in 21st century road racing — such as Stefano Bonetti, Luca Gottardi or Alex Polita — by taking on the most famous and feared race in the East.
According to the Road Racing News portal, there will be more newcomers to the Guia Circuit this year, such as Mitch Rees, a driver with several titles in New Zealand, Ryan Whitehall, a driver from the Isle of Wight, and the new holder of the Frohburger Dreieck lap record in the Supersport category, Paul Jordan.
Questions in the GT
Stéphane Ratel, founder and CEO of SRO Motorsports Group — the company that co-organizes the FIA ​​GT World Cup Macau Grand Prix — has been one of the most critical voices regarding the introduction of torque sensors in GT3 racing. However, the FIA ​​decided in favor of its use in the Guia Circuit World Cup, and the French businessman spoke about the matter for the first time.
"The teams competing in Macau are mostly from Asia, where torque sensors have never been used. The lack of experience could affect the sporting balance, and that's why I opposed their use", said Stéphane Ratel to the German magazine Motorsport Aktuell, adding that he does not believe this is the way forward.
Although the SRO Motorsports Group is co-organizer of the event and has a Balance of Performance (BoP) recognized worldwide, in the last two years the Macau BoP has been determined by the FIA ​​itself. Last year, the FIA's BoP was subject to a series of criticisms, with teams and drivers – particularly from Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, the main losers – publicly expressing their displeasure at the differences in pace. For this reason, the FIA ​​decided to introduce these expensive sensors, installed on the cars' transmission shafts, which represent the most accurate tool for measuring the power transmitted to the wheels.
“Some manufacturers supported the idea, but others, like Mercedes, were against it,” said Stéphane Ratel. "As a result, we lost some cars from the entry list. To be clear: I look at this issue pragmatically, not dogmatically. Last year in Macau, three or four manufacturers could have won without these torque sensors. In 2025 we will see if this technology is really useful", he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-10-10 00:11:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing | Diogo Craveiro with bronze at the figure skating world championships</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/10/24/pequim-diogo-craveiro-com-bronze-nos-mundiais-de-patinagem-artistica/</link><description>Portuguese skater Diogo Craveiro won this Thursday the bronze medal in the free variant of the World Figure Skating Championship, taking place in Beijing.

The German manufacturer, who won for the first time in Macau in 1956, cited the new torque sensors as the reason for his absence, but there is evidence that other factors also played a part in the decision.
For the first time since the creation of the FIA ​​GT World Cup in 2015, Mercedes-AMG will not be represented in the race. The reason, officially, is the change in the technical regulations, with the imposition of torque sensors, a requirement that Mercedes-AMG and its customer teams claim they have not been able to prepare adequately to compete competitively. At least, the Hong Kong teams, GruppeM Racing and Craft-Bamboo Racing, had intentions of returning to the Macao SAR race this year.
“This decision was taken together with our teams”, explained Stefan Wendl, responsible for Mercedes-AMG Customer Racing, in a statement shared with the press. "The additional technical and budgetary costs associated with the recently introduced torque sensors are, unfortunately, unaffordable for us. Together with the teams that normally compete in Macau, we carefully evaluated all available options. In the end, we came to the conclusion that, given the current conditions, it would not be possible to guarantee a sufficient level of preparation to ensure a competitive overall package."
Neither of the two Hong Kong-based teams has any experience with torque sensors, Mercedes-AMG knew since March that it would have to solve this problem if it wanted to return to the Guia Circuit. However, he did nothing in this regard. On the other hand, the Mercedes-AMG team competing in the FIA ​​World Endurance Championship (WEC) this year, Iron Lynx, faced difficulties when the MagCanica sensors did not integrate correctly with Magneti Marelli's ECU software. But this is not the whole story,
Other “obstacles”
Mercedes-AMG is in a transition phase, moving away from its former long-time partner, HWA, to establish its own internal competition division, called Affalterbach Racing GmbH. However, in this transition phase, the brand continues to use HWA engineers, despite many of this company's staff having already moved to the brand's new official structure, and to support the sale of material to its customers, which is seen by many as an uncomfortable situation.
On the other hand, the Mercedes-AMG GT3 is reaching the end of its life, with the Stuttgart brand developing another car for the category, the details of which remain secret, based on the Concept AMG GT Track Sport, and whose arrival on the market is expected in 2027. Although Mercedes-AMG continues to invest energy, money and resources in its projects in the GT3 category in this transition phase, the reality is that the brand's focus is on the future and not on the present. The high cost of introducing these torque sensors, without guarantees of reliability, would have forced Mercedes-AMG Customer Racing to make major commitments at a time when it has internal obstacles to overcome.
Guaranteed return
This absence of the German brand marks the end of a series of victories for the Mercedes-AMG GT3. On the streets of Macau, the car, which is now in its second evolution, after its launch in 2015, achieved five World Cup victories, out of a possible seven, the most recent being in 2024 with the German Maro Engel. In the pandemic years, from 2020 to 2022, in which the FIA ​​did not hold the World Cup, the three-pointed star brand won all three editions of the Macau GT Cup.
Therefore, it is no surprise that “the FIA ​​GT World Cup continues to be an attractive event for Mercedes-AMG, both from a sporting and strategic point of view, and we look back and see a long and successful history in Macau”, explained Stefan Wendl, taking the opportunity to wish “all participants in Macau an exciting and successful racing weekend”.
Despite the absence of Mercedes-AMG, the entry list for the FIA ​​GT World Cup, which will take place from 13 to 16 November, will feature sixteen cars from six giants of the automotive industry: Audi, BMW, Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren and Porsche.</description><pubDate>2025-10-23 23:51:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorsport | MSAR comics with special premiere in Japan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/26/automobilismo-banda-desenhada-da-raem-com-estreia-especial-no-japao/</link><description>The Macau comic strip, “Heróis do Circuito” (街道), had its first international appearance in a very special way two weeks ago, at the 1000 km of Suzuka, in Japan
The classic endurance race had not been contested since 2019, and, to mark the return of this iconic race in the Land of the Rising Sun, Porsche Motorsport Asia Pacific decided to decorate the three cars it supported with the Stuttgart brand's historic colors. Among them, one of Absolute Racing's Porsche 911 GT3 R was painted yellow and black, in honor of Joest Racing's victory in the 1985 24 Hours of Le Mans, when Portuguese Domingos Piedade was Sporting Director of the German team. With the current sponsors, and not with the French clothing brand NewMan, responsible for the decoration 40 years ago, the inscription in Portuguese stood out on the rear wing of the Porsche 911 GT3 R nº 7: “Heróis do Circuito”.
For those who follow local motor sport closely, the comic strip “Heróis do Circuito” is already part of the territory’s motoring culture. Passionate about the ninth art and a self-confessed devotee of motor sports, MP Man is the “Jean Graton of Macau”. His title, often seen on cars at local Grand Prix races, has this time reached an international stage.
Regarding participation in the most prestigious endurance race for GT3 cars on the Asian continent, MP Man told HM: "Upon receiving this exciting news, I felt surprise and admiration. This recognition not only appreciates the effort and dedication of years, but also opens a door for the presence of an original Macau brand on the international motorsport stages, allowing us to show the world the unique cultural character and creativity of Macau, an honor that fills me with pride and enthusiasm."
The international debut could not have gone better in sporting terms, as Absolute Racing's #7 Porsche 911 GT3 R, driven by Kévin Estre, Laurens Vanthoor and Patrick Pilet, crossed the line in second place overall, in a race that also scored points for the Intercontinental GT Challenge.
Bring together synergies
Interestingly, the springboard for placing the MSAR cartoon on a top car from Absolute Racing, an Asian team supported by Porsche Motorsport Asia Pacific and with several triumphs in the Macau GT Cup, was a common sponsor: a model car brand from southern China.
"We maintain a close and friendly relationship with the renowned national collector model brand Almost Real. The founder, Liu Xueshen, Mr. Sum, has always enthusiastically supported my comic book, and has now become one of the main sponsors.
With an ambitious vision, they intend to take the work across borders, exploring new horizons", explained the author, responsible for some of the illustrations on display at the Macau Grand Prix Museum. "By becoming sponsors of Absolute Racing, they integrated elements of the Heróis do Circuito brand into the racing car's paintwork, allowing the vehicle, when running on the track, to announce to the world the unique charm of the comic strip.”
For MP Man, who launched the first issue of “Heróis do Circuito” in 2018, the objective is clear: “For racing and comic book fans to pay more attention to the original creation made in Macau and recognize the effort dedicated to this project.”
Looking to the future
Presence at the Suzuka event, which brought together more than 65 thousand spectators, constituted a decisive step in the brand's internationalization.
"Now, “Heroes of the Circuit” has reached a moment of great significance. Like an eagle taking flight, he has successfully joined a team supported by Porsche, participating in an endurance race that brings together the best teams and drivers from all over Asia", says MP Man, who does not hide his ambition to go further. "If one day my brand manages to reach races like Le Mans, or even a Formula 1 Grand Prix, it will be a dream come true! (laughs) This is, without a doubt, my deepest desire. But I also know that dreams do not come true immediately; my work still has a lot to evolve and perfect. I will continue to create with humility, persevering in improving the work, seeking to offer readers increasingly exciting experiences."
Meanwhile, the fourth volume of the “Circuit Heroes” series is about to be published, opening a new chapter, always with its unique charm and captivating narratives that have won the attention and affection of the local public, increasingly establishing itself in the global universe of comics and among motor sports fans.</description><pubDate>2025-09-26 07:21:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Vernice Lao, just 15 years old, made her F4 debut in Chengdu</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/09/19/vernice-lao-de-apenas-15-anos-estreou-se-na-f4-em-chengdu/</link><description>In an initiative supported by the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), Marcus Cheong and Vernice Lao participated in the Chengdu race of the Chinese Formula 4 Championship. The two drivers from local karting competed against some of the best single-seater drivers in the region, and for young Vernice Lao, this was an absolute debut in motorsport.
At the newly built Tianfu Chengdu International Circuit, Marcus Cheong returned to the Formula 4 discipline, having already had several forays into the category, having even finished in 12th place in the 2023 Macau Grand Prix Formula 4 Race.
On this return, the Macau driver drove one of the Mygale chassis, the same as those that will be used in the FIA ​​World Cup at the Guia Circuit, at the end of the year, by the Apollo RFN Racing by Blackjack team. In the sister team Asia Racing Team, founded in Macau in 2003, and also supported by AAMC, 15-year-old Vernice Lao took her first steps in motor racing, after two days of testing in Zhuhai with the single-seater built in France.
Rodolfo Ávila, Team Manager of the team of the two drivers from the territory, highlighted "how fantastic it is to see two drivers supported by the AAMC, something that has a special meaning for me, as I also took my first steps in the single-seater competition with the support of the AAMC. Seeing these young talents from Macau following a similar path is extremely gratifying, and their participation has a very special importance for both me and the team."
Consistent results
After Friday's qualifying sessions, in Saturday's first race Marcus Cheong reached sixth place in the CFGP class and finished 12th overall. Vernice Lao ranked 6th in the Formula 4 class for young drivers, occupying 18th position overall. In the second race of the same day, Marcus Cheong repeated the result, again taking 6th place in the CFGP class and 12th place overall. Vernice Lao finished in 23rd place, also securing 6th position in the Formula 4 class.
In the first race on Sunday, Marcus Cheong improved his performance, reaching 5th place in the CFGP class and 10th place overall.

Very positive balance
On a particularly demanding weekend, with variable track conditions, Portuguese Rodolfo Ávila highlighted the performance of the Macau drivers supported by AAMC, Marcus Cheong and Vernice Lao. "Both showed clear progress throughout the weekend and Vernice, in particular, impressed everyone with a clean and confident debut in single-seaters. Competing against such an experienced field, with so little experience in a Formula 4 car, and delivering the performance she achieved was a pleasant surprise", said the 2003 Asian Formula Renault champion.
On social media, Vernice Lao reported that this was “an incredible experience”, adding that “over the weekend we lost a lot, but we ended up achieving a satisfactory result”. The Macao SAR driver acknowledged that “there is still a long way to go” and took the opportunity to thank “the support and encouragement” from the team, the Team Manager and her teammate, in what she classified as “an unforgettable weekend with the Asia Racing Team”.
The next step for the two drivers from the territory is not yet known, but the Chinese Formula 4 Championship ends in the neighboring city of Zhuhai on the weekend of October 11th and 12th. Afterwards, these same cars from the Chinese competition will be reviewed before traveling to Macau, where they will be used in the FIA ​​World Cup.</description><pubDate>2025-09-19 00:42:07</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
