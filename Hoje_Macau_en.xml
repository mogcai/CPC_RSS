According to data from the scholarship market compiled by the news agency, global funds have reduced their positions in the last 12 sessions on the island's scholarship market, disintelating in the net value of 391 billion Taiwanese dollars since Wednesday.

TSMC, which recorded revenues equivalent to 15,500 million euros in the first two months of the year, 39.2 percent than in the same period of 2024, down 0.4 percent at the same time, after closed 1.75 percent the day before.

SS consider that they have met the “all needs” of the victim and family in a timely manner
 
The two -year -old girl passed away who had been hit by debris projected by an explosion in Taiwan. Although the death happened on Friday at the Conde São Januário Hospital Center, the information was released on Wednesday night by the Taiwan media.
The case dates back to February 13, when a family with seven macao elements was touring Taichung and was hit by several objects projected to the street due to an explosion on the 12th floor of a shopping center. That day, two residents were declared dead, the family grandparents of the family. However, the two -year -old girl, granddaughter of the other deadly victims, stood in a coma, with brain injuries, linked to the machine and fighting for life.
The girl was transported to Macao on February 26, always remaining in a coma, and hospitalized at the Conde São Januário Hospital Center. On Friday night, March 7, it died. The information was communicated to Taiwan's media by the man who on the day of the accident helped transport the urgent girl to the hospital.
However, death information was not communicated in Macau. The information was only made public, then news has been advanced by the Taiwan media, where the case is still being investigated and promises many developments, because of the need to determine responsibilities about the accident and paid compensation to the victims' families. From the accident, with regard to victims of Macao, four other injuries were resulted in no problem.

The Power of the People's Association defends the creation of a working group to control price fluctuations linked to oil -derived products in Macao. The position was taken by President Lam Weng Ioi, through a letter delivered to the executive headquarters.
According to the message released yesterday, the association considers it "evident" that prices need to be regulated because they "keep" always "very high", with an average of over 14 patacas per liter of gasoline, although the price of Crude suffers several fluctuations.
From the perspective of the association directed by LAM, the need for supervision becomes even clearer, when the prices practiced are very similar to those charged at other times when the price of oil was much higher. "Increasing prices of these first -need goods is invariably to increase population charges," he is argued.
Therefore, the Power of the People's Association suggests a group to “monitor and control the prices” of oil derivatives, and especially those of goods or services with the highest impact on the life of the population, such as the price of fuel, transport, communications and electricity. “Relevant companies must be subject to licensing and supervision,” was nominated.
The Association also indicates that companies "exploring public services must be required to disclose prices and limit their profits, and their financial data should be audited and published." "The government should evaluate the prices and operational performance of the companies in question and regularly review licenses, as well as introduce more competitors through regular public tenders," he was added.
Eternal struggle
Also in the letter the association is insisted on one of its main flags, the control of issuing authorizations for non -resident workers.
"According to the complaints of our members, some companies controlled or supervised by public services, such as parking parks or other services subcontracted by public services, are full of non -resident workers, for work such as cleaning, condominium management and even engineering," he was nominated.
"We do not support the discrimination of non -resident workers, but the government should take the initiative to encourage these companies to hire more resident workers, especially in the current economic situation," he was stressed. "The priority of local workers in access to employment should not just be an empty slogan," was concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 02:17:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Pass | Controversial card exchange due to collection</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/14/macau-pass-troca-de-cartao-polemica-devido-a-cobranca/</link><description>After an elderly man complaining about requested 50 patacas to change Macau Pass, the government said that from today there are no charges, after announcing that the exchange was free. As for the request to sign lists for the elections, the executive assured HM that if he is aware of irregularities will end card exchange posts
 
After a complaint on Monday that an elderly woman was invited to signing a candidacy report for legislative elections when she exchanged the Macau Pass card to the elderly to participate in the great consumption award in a local association, yesterday the process again got to know a new episode.
Once again, in the Macao Macao Forum Program of the Radio Macao Chinese channel, an elderly man complained of being charged 50 patacas to change the Macau Pass card to the elderly that allows you to participate in the program for discounts and incentive for consumption consumption consumption. The case occurred in a Macau Pass store where the employee will have informed the resident that he would be exchanged in one of about 60 exchange posts in social services and local associations the service would be free.
It is recalled that at the end of last week, the day the card exchange began, the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) issued a statement informing that “the treatment of replacement formalities” was free. Also the request for a temporary card would have no charges. “If the elderly need to use the card during the replacement period, Macau Pass will provide them with free temporary use card”, even at Macau Pass service centers.
After the complaint, DSEDT clarified that the 50 patacas charged would be returned in the balance of the new card. In addition, the government negotiated with Macau Pass to, starting today, finish the pre-ability of fees to change cards.
Electoral little leg
In addition to the collection of 50 patacas, the exchange of cards and the request of temporary cards that is made exclusively at Macau Pass stores has been criticized by the long lines it has generated. Deputy Pereira Coutinho was one of the voices that denounced the situation.
On the other hand, when the card exchange service was only three business days, a resident claimed that his grandmother was invited to sign a candidacy report to legislative elections while trying to change the Macau Pass card to the elderly in a local association.
HM contacted all public services involved (Institute of Social Action, Commission on Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly and DSEDT), to find out if any investigation related to electoral actions would be underway during the exchange of the elderly cards, and what the consequences, and only obtained response from DSEDT. The body led by Yau Yun Wah began by mentioning that DSEDT organized training sessions and clarification for "collaborating entities regarding elderly card replacement procedures."
In addition, DSEDT said it had elaborated "Operation and Confidentiality Guidelines" and requested "employees of all service posts that fulfilled them rigorously."
Regarding the request to sign candidates' propositions during card exchange, DSEDT points out that it has “remembered its employees that they should be conferenceed with residents assistance in replacing cards, limiting only the service available to card replacement”. Communication that DSEDT guaranteed HM, in an email sent late Wednesday afternoon, was reiterated "a few days ago."
Regarding possible consequences of electoral use of associations in the work of replacement of cards, the government guaranteed the HM that it will be aware. "DSEDT will continue to supervise all service posts, and if you check the violation of guidelines in any of these, you will immediately cease the card replacement service provided by the service station involved," he was added.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 02:10:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Chan u law asks for explanations about health tourism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/14/economia-lei-chan-u-pede-explicacoes-sobre-turismo-de-saude/</link><description>The workers' deputy asks the executive to present the measures he will adopt to foster the health tourism industry, which is seen as one of the pillars of economic diversification
 
Deputy Lei Chan U wants the government to present the measures that will be adopted to realize the policy of exploitation of health tourism. The question is part of a written interpellation, and comes after the islands hospital has been operating in September last year.
According to the deputy, the executive indicated that the way to explore health tourism was the creation of partnerships between the authorities, the concessionaires and the different medical services. However, a legislator linked to the Macau Workers' Federation (Faom) considers that it is necessary to make more information available on what is really intended for the sector and how the objectives will be fulfilled: “What is the point of situation about the use of the Macao Union Medical Medical Center College Hospital as a catalyst to attract more health tourists and promote the development of this sector in Macao?” questions the deputy of the workers. “And what concrete measures were adopted by the government to actually apply these plans?” He adds.
According to the understanding of Chan U law, with the Operating Islands Hospital since September 2024 it is necessary to “gradually reinforce its role and its functions in promoting the development of the sector”.
Day -hospitals
In addition to asking for written interplies that it goes from paper to reality, law Chan U questions the executive about the plans to create the so -called “hospitals of the day”.
Initially presented last year, the idea is to create new health facilities in the licensing system, which occupy an intermediate function, between clinics and hospitals. According to the molds presented, and cited by Chan U law, the creation of the new health units implies the alteration of the licensing regime of health institutions. And the government has promised a new public consultation in this regard. However, developments have not yet been found. As such, law asks for a point of the situation: “Administration indicated that it will launch a public consultation about the increase in the number of licenses for hospitals in the first quarter of 2025. What is the point of the situation of the preparatory work of the public consultation? When is the start of public consultation expected? ”, He interrogates.
Presented as one of the major health projects in Macao, Hospital das Islands opened last year in September. However, contrary to what was expected is not a public hospital, and management was delivered to a private entity, the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. When they want to use these services, residents have to pay like any tourist or other client. The only way to be cared for equal to those of the public sector happens when residents are referred to this hospital for health services.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 01:52:45</pubDate></item><item><title>IC | Launched book on the historical roots of Rua das Estlagês</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/14/ic-lancado-livro-sobre-as-raizes-historicas-da-rua-das-estalagens/</link><description>“In Search of Its Roots - An Illustrated History of Street of Estalagins” is the name of the work Bilingual, launched in digital format, which tells the story of this historic street of Macao, revealing the business that survived the passage of time. Production was in charge of the Macao Artists Society, with the support of the Cultural Institute and Sands China
 
The history serpes through the stalage street since the end of the nineteenth century. The narrow artery has always been the scene of an intense social and commercial rebolement and it was where Sun Yat-Sen, considered the father of modern China and the Republican Revolution, opened pharmacies and drugstores, especially from 1893. Over the years, Rua das Estalagem, in Porto, was a living example of commerce, and the Portuguese governors were progressively expanding the street, composed of the street Chinese -style buildings and temples, such as the Temple of the Bazaar and Goddess Temple NOVA WO.
All these pieces of history are now counting on the digital publication “In Search of Its Roots - An Illustrated History of Rua das Estlagês”, a work produced by the Society of Macao Artists and authored by Siguo Chen in Shirley Lule's texts and illustrations. Those responsible for the edition are the Cultural Institute (IC) and the game operator Sands China.
According to a press release of Sands China, the book, in Chinese and English, intends to “highlight the fascinating past of the historic Macau Street and the beauty of its legacy”, containing interviews with street -related figures, whether merchants or residents. Thus, it is intended to bring “residents and visitors to rediscover the preciousness of the centenary stores and the cultural heritage of the street through legendary stories” so that they can “widen their understanding of the transformation of the neighborhood and its inhabitants”.
The content of the book results from “close conversations with representatives of associations, business entities and residents of the neighborhood,” having dozens of oral stories that can easily be lost if not recorded. This work is not closed in the digital world, having been printed to appear in the public libraries of Macao and schools, in order to “promote the meaning of cultural heritage and enhance mutual ties among the people of Macao”, intending to be “a valuable community resource to deepen the understanding and appreciation of Macao and the street”.
200 years of history
One of the highlights given in the book is to the textile sector that has always predominated on Rua das Estlagenas. In the chapter entitled "Two Centuries of Prosperity: Spinning A Legacy in the Textiles Trade" [two centuries of prosperity: the construction of a legacy in the textile trade], it is read that "Street of Estlagins has always been a center for the textile industry." In the years when the textile sector had a larger presence in the territory, between the 70's and 90's, "Rua housed more than 20 stores with factory products, including three spaces from the Veng On Farm Store." “Around 30 businesses related to these stores, such as tailors, clothing stores, western products and funeral ornament stores, which brought a reputation to the street,” he reads. In Rua das Estlagenas “Tissue trade is over 200 years old,” says the same text.
Other chapters of the book speak of the presence of the republican revolutionary in Macao in “The Starting Point of Sun Yat-Sen’s Story” [The Starting Point of the story of Sun Yat-Sen] or stories of street-linked personalities and their commerce.
In the conclusion of the work, it refers that after the transition, the street "faced new challenges: the global financial crisis, the SARS epidemic, the COVID-19, and the uncertainty of the economy, leaving the need for renewal again."
“In the past, businesses flourished by themselves thanks to hard work and resilience. But nowadays the community joins with a shared view, actively planning [the development of the street] with the support of the Macao government and the integrated resort companies. With these efforts, there is a sense of hope that Rua das Estlagês briefly recovers its ancient vitality, being ready for a new era of prosperity, ”is pointed out.
Institutional view
IC President Deland Leong Wai Man pointed out that the book results from the “weighted effort to widen the discussion around preservation and revitalization [of the street],” according to the same press release. "Street renewal is expected to inspire more people to learn about the historic neighborhoods of Macao and participate in their preservation, combining ideas and resources to ensure that the city's culture and history continue to prosper during generations," he said.
In turn, Wilfred Wong, CEO of Sands China, argued that "Street of Estalagues is a microcosm of Macao itself, a place where a rich story meets a modern future."
“The walls of their alleys witnessed the transformation of Macao, and their stories and people deserve to be remembered, as they are precious sources of Macao's cultural heritage. Our effort to publish the book was possible thanks to the collaboration of our local team to conduct interviews with owners of historic stores, create illustrations and take photographs, among other works, ”he said.
New facades
It is recalled that this publication arises after the Government was announced by the Sands performance at the Rua das Estalagens Revitalization Plan, namely with the “Entrepreneurs Recruitment Program for Rua das Estlagês”, launched in April last year.
The game operator explains that the seven businesses selected for the initiative “have been opening through phases, bringing energy to the zone along with other new businesses, providing a platform for young ambitious entrepreneurs to realize their dreams”.
In addition, the game operator intends to revitalize stores' façades “with drawings that enhance their characteristics, resonating the history of the street and the city”. For this initiative, Sands has also collaborated with the Macao Artist Society, and the drawings will be created by two young local artists, Chek On Law and Sit Kat Kit.
"The aim is that, with a collective effort like this, the community can rediscover the history of the street and learn about its past stories and stores through the visual interpretations of these local artists from Macao and their perceptions of the territory," he reads.
Siguo Chen, the book's author, is a veteran journalist with a career of over 60 years who has been deeply linked to the media area in Macau and Hong Kong.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 01:50:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Taiwan | Actions register record sales abroad with falling TSMC</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/14/taiwan-accoes-registam-recorde-de-vendas-no-estrangeiro-com-queda-da-tsmc/</link><description>The actions of Taiwanese companies suffered the largest escape from foreign investors due to the alienation of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, Bloomberg said yesterday.

The curriculum will cover all stages of education, from elementary school to high school, and aims to strengthen students' abilities in this key area. Schools will have the flexibility to create AI autonomous courses or combine them with other subjects, such as information technology, science, practical activities and work education, adds the publication.
In addition, under the program, the Chinese capital plans to train one hundred specialized teachers and a thousand prominent specialized teachers in AI teaching.
The initiative is part of Beijing's broader effort to accelerate the construction of an IA educational system with characteristics of the capital and, at the same time, promote the reform and development of basic education. Focusing on six key areas of AI application, including teaching, learning, promotion, evaluation, research and administration, the city will explore new AI application scenarios.

An 'excessive pressure' of the precious good that is water, reason for choosing places to live, which when excessive causes an imbalance.
A Qianlong court painter (R.1735-96) called Xie Sui treated this theme of the struggle to live with the excessive nature in a remarkable way in various vertical rollers, such as the Great Domestic Flooding (ink and color on paper, 188.6 x 115.4 cm, sold in Sothebes) where he highlights the figure of a large amount of generic painted workers.
But his work to recreate characters in paintings to the court would be more detailed when he made a series of four horizontal rolls with three hundred and one figures of people, representing the most diverse peoples coming from the four corners of the world to take tribute to the son of heaven.
This figuration was inserted into the ancient tradition of portraits of the periods that came from the Tang dynasty and explained in 1636 by the Came Chen Zushou, already in dialogue with knowledge that brought Europeans: “All barbaric peoples within the four seas should come to pay tribute to our emperor. Although they (the Jesuits) can describe the world as understanding five continents, it is yet four of them that should surround the core of the Empire.

Unavoidable figure in the political history of modern China and the father of the movement that led to the fall of the imperial regime, Sun Yat-Sen was celebrated yesterday in Guangzhou, where he was born, Beijing and Taiwan
 
The first president of China post-imperial and considered the father of the country's modern era, Sun Yat-Sen, was remembered yesterday in mainland China and Taiwan, the 100th anniversary of his death.
In Beijing, there was a “brief and solemn ceremony” of honor to Sun in Beijing Park that has its name. Authorities and “people from all the sectors of society” were present, kept silence and made three venias in front of their statue, the Xinhua official news agency said.
The Chinese Academy of History praised the political figure in his Weibo account, describing him as "a great national hero, a great patriot and a major precursor of the Democratic Revolution of China."
The city of Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, where Sun Yat-Sen was born, inaugurated on Tuesday an exhibition of old objects related to the man who was one of the promoters of the revolution that overthrew the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Building in the city welcomed the first performance of a musical based on the revolutionary's youth.
In Guangzhou, where there is also a university named Sun Yat-Sen, this exhibition is exhibited, which includes objects such as the Sun Yat-Sen Graduation Exam report at the College of Medicine for Chinese, in Hong Kong, from 1892. The certificate of marriage between Sun Yat-Sen and Soong Ching-Ling is also highlighted in 1915, a woman later, woman later, Vice-President of China during the government of Mao Tse-Tung, embracing communism. In the same exhibition you can also see the bronze bust of Sun Yat-Sem itself, made by order of the Japanese friend Umeya Shokichi in 1929.
The "father" of modern China was also remembered in Taiwan, with a ceremony by the Sun Yat-sen memorial in Taipei, where flowers were deposited and express respect.
Double memories
Despite founding, in 1919, the Kuomitang, which would become the main rival of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Sun is remembered in both mainland China and Taiwan. The Board of State's Taiwan Cabinet stated that Sun Yat-Sen “sought China's national unity and revitalization throughout his life,” appealing at the same time to the “compatriots of Taiwan to join us in the inheritance of his legacy” and to “oppose secession” of the island.
Born in 1866, Sun studied medicine in Hong Kong - then a British colony - and, after leading several revolts, gained notoriety as a revolutionary leader and as a driving force of an attempt to modernize the country.
In 1911, the Xinhai Revolution led to the fall of the Qing and Sun Yat-Sen dynasty was appointed provisional president of the New Republic of China in January 1912, but quickly gave power to the country's main military leader, Yuan Shikai, who, far from consolidating republican ideals, dissolved the parliament in 1914 and proclaimed herself in 1915, annulling Grande, annul Part of the democratic progress by which Sun had fought.
From then on, he continued to promote his ideal of a unified and republican China, reorganizing the KMT and seeking international support for his cause. In 1923, he established an alliance with the newly founded CCP and received the support of the Soviet Union to reinforce the political movement. However, he failed to consolidate a stable government before his death in 1925.
A LIFE OF FIGHT
In the work “Sisters Soong-the oldest, younger and redest,” by Jung Chang, some details of Sun Yat-Sen's life are described before embracing the revolutionary cause and the way he left his parents' house in Guangzhou, looking for a better life.
The place of destination was Hawaii, which on July 4, 1894 declared itself as a Republic, an event that, according to the book, "helped shape today's China." “A 27-year-old radical Chinese, Sun Yat-sen, landed in the archipelago and entered a world where the word 'republic' was in every mouth,” he is described.
In China, the agitation against the power of the empire became strong. The Republic "was a new concept," for "the monarchy was the only political system that China knew." "At the time, the country was governed by the Manchu dynasty," the Manchus "were not natural from China, but they had conquered the territory in the mid -seventeenth century." “Since they did not get more than one percent of the population, they were considered a minority of foreign rulers and had never lacking opposition from the native rebels Han. Sun was one of them, ”he describes himself in the same work.
Sun Yat-Sen was "a low, dark man with well-proposed and pleasant traits." Its home village, Cuiheng, had soils inappropriate for agriculture, which provided “a life of extreme misery” to those who lived there. As such, the revolutionary's family did not escape adverse conditions.
In his first escape from the context of poverty, Sun went to Hong Kong, finding shelter to the diocesan school and boys orphanage, then accepted a marriage arranged by the family as a gimmick to return to the village. Sun Yat-Sen married Mu-Zhen, had children, but was an absent figure and something carefree in the face of family responsibilities, traveling the world to seek support for the revolution he wanted for China.
Jung Chang's work describes how Sun's course linked to the "three sisters," Ei-Ling, May-Ling and Ching-Ling. Charlie Soong funded and supported Sun Yat-Sen in her revolutionary causes, one of her daughters, Ei-Ling, became the republican secretary. This, although married, had made attempts to approach loving and EI-Ling, but eventually had a relationship with Ching-Ling, who was nationalist, but later embraced communism, being known as the "red sister." Ching-ling was also known as the Madame Sun Yat-Sen, but at the time of Sun Yat-Sen's death, the relationship between them had cooled.
After the establishment of the Popular Republic of China, Ching-Ling was vice president of the country, between 1949 and 1954, and then between 1959 and 1975, and was vice president of the Permanent Commission of the National Assembly.
Passage through macau
Moreover, Sun Yat-Sen's life crossed Macao several times, where he lived a short time, unlike his woman, Mu-Zhen, and the children who remained in the territory longer. To remember the short period in which the Republican lived in the territory, at the time under Portuguese administration, the memorial house of dr. Sun Yat-Sen, where he "witnesses the short but significant stay in Macao in the early twentieth century when, running away from the power of imperial mandarins, tried to move his supporters forces in order to implement a new regime in China." “In Macau received support from some friends who were illustrious and influential figures of social and political life at the time,” reads the description of the museum.
Another interesting detail of the 1911 Republican Revolution is the proximity of dates against the establishment of the Republic in Portugal, which took place on October 5, 1910. Macau, in the midst of events in China and Portugal, was only aware that the constitutional monarchy had fallen into Lisbon thanks to the sending of a telegram published in an official bulletin on October 10, 1910, changing the governor in this context.

Recently, Deputy Lam Lon Wai defended its use and, in Portugal, the Order of Psychologists created the “PSIA” platform, which allows it to detect symptoms. Nuno Gomes and Goreti Lima, two resident therapists, talk about the benefits, risks and potential uses of technology
 
Understanding whether emotions can result in psychological forum diseases is something that is already possible to do using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The issue begins to discuss in Macao still shyly, namely through Deputy Lam Lon Wai, who in February interpelled the government about the need to apply AI tools in clinical cases with young people.
HM spoke to two clinical psychologists who work with residents of Macao, in person or distance, about the benefits and risks of betting on AI. Nuno Gomes, a psychologist in a local clinic, says that “is, for now, a help, and it will always be”.
“AI is an irreversible process and it is inevitable that it covers all fields of our lives, and in them is psychology and help people. But I come from a field of psychology that is the humanist school, which is based on the relationship with the patient, and therefore I do not see great benefits, for the use of AI, because in human relations AI does not enter, ”he defended.
Nuno Gomes believes that AI can help in the diagnostic phase, although he thinks "the psychologist will always be the central character." “AI can be an advantage in Macau for people who have difficulty asking for help. The use of the well -defined AI, even in ethical terms, may be very useful for the beginning of a therapy. However, at this moment we have no conditions for the use of AI at the level of a more complete and background therapy, ”he said.
Nuno Gomes also recalls that for those who want to talk to someone, AI "can give the feeling that we are not alone and that is someone on the other side." It is a feeling that is still "strange", but "in the future will no longer be, because AI will be part of our day."
The psychologist believes that AI "may work as long as it is ethically well regulated and can help in brief therapies, but always as a complement to a larger process."
Goreti Lima, who has lived in Macao, continues to do clinical psychology at a distance with residents living in the territory. It is more skeptical in relation to the use of AI, arguing that human relationship is always fundamental for quality monitoring.
“Therapy is done in the relationship and these applications do not contemplate this. I think very well that we can use AI to diagnose, see symptoms, but this we can also do with a book or article. ChatgPT already tells us some things in the area of ​​psychology, possible symptom analysis. AI helps in this process, but then the rest works in the therapeutic relationship. This is why people like more from one psychologist or another. Then there is the ethical question, the data is stored as? Where do you go? Can people trust? ”He asks.
Recommendations in Portugal
In a written interpeação directed to the Government of MSAR, Deputy Lam Lon Wai questioned whether there will be “cooperation” between government departments, technological companies and local academic institutions in the use of AI in the area of ​​mental health. However, Goreti Lam regrets that deputy "do not speak in the figure of the psychologist."
“Academics have a different experience from psychologists and therapists, who have gained this experience in practical terms. This develops over time. All these questions have to be thought of when applying AI. AI can identify what the person has and even techniques to be used, but then we have to take into account deontological conditions. The assessment always has nuances depending on the social context of the person, and this is never analyzed in AI, or is unquestionable, ”he added.
Portugal is one of the countries where the application of AI in Psychology begins to gain some form, to the point of the Order of Portuguese Psychologists (OPP) has created the online “Psia” tool, which allows you to state a series of symptoms and reach a diagnosis. Personal data appear to be protected with the introduction, on the website, the citizen card number, with the digital mobile key.
In addition, OPP has created a manual of good practices, entitled “The Human Factor in Artificial Intelligence - Strategic Recommendations for Sustainability”, which states that there are “virtual therapists who can identify, in communication with people, emotional difficulties that facilitate deliberate psychological education”, as well as enhancing “the learning of techniques and skills that aim, for example, to reduce anxiety”.
In addition, the OPP document concludes that "some studies suggest that these chatbots, developed based on validated therapeutic models, may be effective in reducing depressive symptoms and even that some people establish a bond similar to that of a human relationship." However, “these evidence is not consolidated and security-related (people and data), eventual dependence on technologies and the responsiveness of support given to different psychological difficulties are not clarified”, it reads.
Relativamente ao PsIA, é referido no website da OPP que “em questões muito específicas ou complexas não deve ser utilizado em tarefas que requeiram julgamento e avaliação especializados, análise técnica profunda ou aconselhamento profissional”. É ainda esclarecido que as respostas fornecidas baseiam-se “nos documentos e informações disponíveis” até ao dia 31 de Julho do ano passado, além de que a PsIA “não substitui de forma alguma o papel de um psicólogo ou de quaisquer actividades de supervisão”.
In the case of Hong Kong, some solutions are also beginning to emerge, which motivated, by the way, the interpellation of Deputy Lam Lon Wai. This is the case of Hollo, a mobile phone application developed in connection with the University of Hong Kong (UHK) that aims to “make mental health care more accessible to patients, service platforms and organizations”.
Hollo uses AI power and technologies to bring clinical practices standardized to another level of productivity, intelligence and digital connectivity. According to Cameron Van Breda, Hollo's CEO and co-founder, the company aims to be "an easily accessible tool in stress times, offering analysis and friendship suggestions for better mental health exercises." In practical terms, “focuses on young people from 12 to 24 years old, works in English and Chinese and introduce them to therapy and counseling practices through mindfulness activities and daily games,” reads UHK's website.
Almost the same
Asked about Macao's mental health landscape, Nuno Gomes understands that he persists "some conservatism and ignorance not only in what is AI and areas where one can apply, but also what psychology can do."
“Psychology is here to help people and in the context of Macao there is no such understanding yet. This stigma prevents many people from seeking help and AI can give this support. However, the older population is still very unaware of the operation of AI, but the younger ones will increasingly resort to this type of platforms, ”he said.
In general terms, “the picture of mental health has changed little from the pandemic”, because “in general, people are not necessary to express emotions and since they are encouraged to keep emotions, which when they are bad and stored a long time, they begin to hurt. People don't know how to express them out of shame or guilt. ” Goreti Lima also understands that in the area of ​​mental health there is still some ignorance in Macau.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:36:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Architecture | Liu Jiakun won Pritzker 2025 prize</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/07/arquitectura-liu-jiakun-venceu-premio-pritzker-2025/</link><description>Liu Jiakun won this year's Pritzker Prize. Chengdu's natural architect was chosen by the work “coherent”, in peace with nature and the surrounding world. The organization of the prize highlights the “path that was neither linear nor expected”, and architectural projects with “convincing answers” ​​in environmental terms
 
In Liu Jiakun's work is the citizen who rules, without fixed lines or barriers, combining the old and the modern. But above all, there is a kind of consistency. The Chinese architect, born in 1956 in Chengdu province, won this year's Pritzker Prize, a distinction often described as the Nobel Prize in Architecture. With this week's announcement, the point that was missing to consecrate the talent of a man who lived and worked in a changing China was added and who narrowly did not give up architecture. By the way, according to the official information of the Pritzker Award on Liu Jiakun, his journey “until architecture was neither linear nor expected”.
The mother was an internal doctor at Chengdu Second People's Hospital and it was there that much of her days spent during her childhood. In the years when China lived intensely Maoism and then during the process of reform and openness, Liu underwent all political and social transformations as it grew. He attended the program for “educated young people” in the area of ​​agriculture, and then the Chongqing Institute of Architecture and Engineering, later called the University of Chongqing University in 1978. “As in a dream, I suddenly realized that my life was important,” he said, according to the official information of the Pritzker award.
The studio in his own name, Jiakun Architects, only emerged in 1999 in his hometown, Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province.
About himself and his work, Liu Jiakun said: "Aspire always being like water-permeating a place without having a fixed shape of his own and infiltrating me in the local environment and in the place itself." “Over time, water is gradually solidified, becoming architecture and perhaps even the highest form of human spiritual creation. However, it maintains all the qualities of this place, both good and bad, ”he added.
Regarding the attribution of Pritzker, the jury considered that the Chinese architect knew how to innovate, keeping the side more traditional than the profession can have. “Identity has as much to do with the individual and the collective meaning of belonging to a place. Liu Jiakun revisits Chinese tradition without nostalgic approach or ambiguity, but as a trampoline for innovation. Create a new architecture that is simultaneously historical record, infrastructure, landscape and a remarkable public space, ”says the organization.
Spatial commitment
Building houses or buildings can be much more than simple building, establishing a commitment to space and the environment. For the Pritzker jury, "in a global context where architecture strives to find adequate answers to rapidly evolving social challenges, Liu Jiakun gave convincing answers that also celebrate people's daily lives as well as their community and spiritual identities."
Also according to the jury, "through a remarkable work of deep consistency and constant quality, Liu Jiakun imagines and builds new worlds, free from any aesthetic or stylistic embarrassment."
“Instead of a style, it has developed a strategy that is never based on a recurring method, but rather the evaluation of the specific characteristics and demands of each project differently. That is, Liu Jiakun takes current realities and manipulates them to the point of offering a totally new scenario of everyday life. In addition to knowledge and technique, it adds common sense and wisdom to the designer toolbox, ”he adds.
The note that presented the award states that the architect can project “a built environment that is often being pulled in opposite directions”, rethinking “the foundations of density through cohabitation, creating an intelligent solution that balances the opposite forces at stake”.
The jury also describes that "through a remarkable work of deep consistency and constant quality, Liu Jiakun imagines and builds new worlds, free from any aesthetic or stylistic embarrassment."
The largest projects
This year's Pritzker statement highlights the “West Village” project in Chengdu, classified as “transformative”, where Liu Jiakun knew “reformulate the paradigm of public spaces and community life”, “inventing new independent and shared forms of living together, where density does not represent the opposite of an open system”. The architect created here a space that allows "adaptation, expansion and replicability."
Also noteworthy are “subtle and memorable museums” created by themselves, such as the Suzhou Museum of Imperial Kiln Brick or the Shuijingfang Museum, also in Chengdu. In turn, at the Huishan Memorial in Chengdu, the architect "understands that identity is a matter of collective and personal memory, brilliantly raising the individual perspective to a fundamental element of place creation in order to revive a community dimension."
Degree in 1982, Liu was part of the first generation of students responsible for the major projects of the so -called “Nova China”, already with Deng Xiaoping to the rudder of the central government. At the beginning of his career, he was linked to Chengdu's Institute for Research and Architectural Design, a state-owned entity, having moved to Nagqu in Tibeta, where he lived two years in the 1980s.
About this time, the architect recalled his “greatest strength at the time seemed to be my fear of nothing, beyond the abilities of painting and writing,” pionering books and writing at night when he did not project.
His career in architecture was almost set aside until Liu Jiakun saw Tang Hua's solo architecture exhibition, a former university colleague at the Shanghai Art Museum in 1993. Such “rekindled his passion for the profession and fueled a new mindset that he could also be diverted from prescribed social aesthetics,” describes the pritzker jury.
For Liu, "architecture must reveal something - abstract, distill and make visible the qualities inherent to local people," "the power to shape human behavior and create atmospheres, offering a sense of serenity and poetry, evoking compassion and mercy, and cultivating a meaning of shared community."</description><pubDate>2025-03-07 02:59:07</pubDate></item><item><title>IC | Launched book on the historical roots of Rua das Estlagês</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/14/ic-lancado-livro-sobre-as-raizes-historicas-da-rua-das-estalagens/</link><description>“In Search of Its Roots - An Illustrated History of Street of Estalagins” is the name of the work Bilingual, launched in digital format, which tells the story of this historic street of Macao, revealing the business that survived the passage of time. Production was in charge of the Macao Artists Society, with the support of the Cultural Institute and Sands China
 
The history serpes through the stalage street since the end of the nineteenth century. The narrow artery has always been the scene of an intense social and commercial rebolement and it was where Sun Yat-Sen, considered the father of modern China and the Republican Revolution, opened pharmacies and drugstores, especially from 1893. Over the years, Rua das Estalagem, in Porto, was a living example of commerce, and the Portuguese governors were progressively expanding the street, composed of the street Chinese -style buildings and temples, such as the Temple of the Bazaar and Goddess Temple NOVA WO.
All these pieces of history are now counting on the digital publication “In Search of Its Roots - An Illustrated History of Rua das Estlagês”, a work produced by the Society of Macao Artists and authored by Siguo Chen in Shirley Lule's texts and illustrations. Those responsible for the edition are the Cultural Institute (IC) and the game operator Sands China.
According to a press release of Sands China, the book, in Chinese and English, intends to “highlight the fascinating past of the historic Macau Street and the beauty of its legacy”, containing interviews with street -related figures, whether merchants or residents. Thus, it is intended to bring “residents and visitors to rediscover the preciousness of the centenary stores and the cultural heritage of the street through legendary stories” so that they can “widen their understanding of the transformation of the neighborhood and its inhabitants”.
The content of the book results from “close conversations with representatives of associations, business entities and residents of the neighborhood,” having dozens of oral stories that can easily be lost if not recorded. This work is not closed in the digital world, having been printed to appear in the public libraries of Macao and schools, in order to “promote the meaning of cultural heritage and enhance mutual ties among the people of Macao”, intending to be “a valuable community resource to deepen the understanding and appreciation of Macao and the street”.
200 years of history
One of the highlights given in the book is to the textile sector that has always predominated on Rua das Estlagenas. In the chapter entitled "Two Centuries of Prosperity: Spinning A Legacy in the Textiles Trade" [two centuries of prosperity: the construction of a legacy in the textile trade], it is read that "Street of Estlagins has always been a center for the textile industry." In the years when the textile sector had a larger presence in the territory, between the 70's and 90's, "Rua housed more than 20 stores with factory products, including three spaces from the Veng On Farm Store." “Around 30 businesses related to these stores, such as tailors, clothing stores, western products and funeral ornament stores, which brought a reputation to the street,” he reads. In Rua das Estlagenas “Tissue trade is over 200 years old,” says the same text.
Other chapters of the book speak of the presence of the republican revolutionary in Macao in “The Starting Point of Sun Yat-Sen’s Story” [The Starting Point of the story of Sun Yat-Sen] or stories of street-linked personalities and their commerce.
In the conclusion of the work, it refers that after the transition, the street "faced new challenges: the global financial crisis, the SARS epidemic, the COVID-19, and the uncertainty of the economy, leaving the need for renewal again."
“In the past, businesses flourished by themselves thanks to hard work and resilience. But nowadays the community joins with a shared view, actively planning [the development of the street] with the support of the Macao government and the integrated resort companies. With these efforts, there is a sense of hope that Rua das Estlagês briefly recovers its ancient vitality, being ready for a new era of prosperity, ”is pointed out.
Institutional view
IC President Deland Leong Wai Man pointed out that the book results from the “weighted effort to widen the discussion around preservation and revitalization [of the street],” according to the same press release. "Street renewal is expected to inspire more people to learn about the historic neighborhoods of Macao and participate in their preservation, combining ideas and resources to ensure that the city's culture and history continue to prosper during generations," he said.
In turn, Wilfred Wong, CEO of Sands China, argued that "Street of Estalagues is a microcosm of Macao itself, a place where a rich story meets a modern future."
“The walls of their alleys witnessed the transformation of Macao, and their stories and people deserve to be remembered, as they are precious sources of Macao's cultural heritage. Our effort to publish the book was possible thanks to the collaboration of our local team to conduct interviews with owners of historic stores, create illustrations and take photographs, among other works, ”he said.
New facades
It is recalled that this publication arises after the Government was announced by the Sands performance at the Rua das Estalagens Revitalization Plan, namely with the “Entrepreneurs Recruitment Program for Rua das Estlagês”, launched in April last year.
The game operator explains that the seven businesses selected for the initiative “have been opening through phases, bringing energy to the zone along with other new businesses, providing a platform for young ambitious entrepreneurs to realize their dreams”.
In addition, the game operator intends to revitalize stores' façades “with drawings that enhance their characteristics, resonating the history of the street and the city”. For this initiative, Sands has also collaborated with the Macao Artist Society, and the drawings will be created by two young local artists, Chek On Law and Sit Kat Kit.
"The aim is that, with a collective effort like this, the community can rediscover the history of the street and learn about its past stories and stores through the visual interpretations of these local artists from Macao and their perceptions of the territory," he reads.
Siguo Chen, the book's author, is a veteran journalist with a career of over 60 years who has been deeply linked to the media area in Macau and Hong Kong.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 01:50:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing | “Two sessions” start today focusing on the economy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/pequim-duas-sessoes-arrancam-hoje-com-foco-na-economia/</link><description>The month of March is synonymous with political movements in Beijing, with the political advisory conference of the Chinese people, which begins today, and the session of the National Popular Assembly, which begins tomorrow. At meetings will be discussed goals and political and economic plans for this year, without forgetting the evolution of the International Panorama
 
Today begins another session of the Chinese Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC), in Beijing, while for tomorrow is scheduled the start of the National Assembly (APN). The two events are the most important of the Chinese political system, materializing the country's political representativeness system, with the participation of delegations all provinces and regions of China, including the special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong. CCPPC has, as the name implies, an advisory character, while APN is the most important legislative body in the country.
The so -called “two sessions”, with annual periodicity, draw the attention from around the world because it is at this time that the Chinese government presents its economic goals and main political measures for the rest of the year.
According to the Xinhua state agency, data related to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the most attention points attracts, but the "two sessions" will also serve to shed some lights on China's foreign policy, something particularly remarkable in a turbulent global scenario.
Until March 11, the expected date for the closure of the work, there are objectives, calendars and essential policies, shaping “the political direction of the country” in a “complex and challenging global environment”, reads in Xinhua.
Let us look, then, to what we can expect in matters of GDP values. “As the Chinese economy is oriented for high quality development, GDP is not the only measure of the economy, but it remains an important indicator. In 2024, China reached its objective of economic growth of about five percent, thanks largely to a number of significant macroeconomic measures, introduced to compensate for the pressure of economic recession, ”he reads.
Thus, "more concrete policies to stimulate economic activity are expected." According to Xinhua, "China has already given signs of change in its macroeconomic orientation." "At the last central conference of economic labor in December, political officials committed to apply more proactive macroeconomic policies in 2025."
Thus, the adoption of a “monetary policy‘ moderately flexible ’was decided, which represents a significant removal from the 'prudent' approach adopted in the last 14 years,” the agency describes. In this meeting were also defined “nine fundamental priorities”, the first “the increase of consumption”.
Thus, it is expected that in the “two sessions”, “China emphasizes internal demand as the main economic priority”, and this year it is expected “that large-scale equipment updates and consumer exchange programs will be promoted with greater intensity and more extended”.
It is indicated that "China will actively use the maneuver margin for a higher deficit and increase the issuance of special obligations of local administrations", as well as "continuing to issue Special Treasury obligations with a longer term and increase central government transfer payments to local administrations." The "two sessions" will reveal more details in this regard.
Featured
Still on the economic level, Xinhua describes how President XI Jinping underlines on other occasions “the main priorities, such as support for the growth of the private sector”, “the acceleration of the development of the digital economy” and the deepening of the country's opening.
APN members “will analyze the annual budget and government development plan”, and proposals and suggestions related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) ”are also expected to be expected. In fact, this is “one of the main points of interest to China observers”, along with GDP values. It should be noted that, in this field, the country has sought to score points and gain a growing positioning in the market with the creation of the Deepseek platform.
According to the Global Times newspaper, Chinese companies such as Tencent, Baidu and Byd are part of DeepSeek in the products and services they make available, and "some local governments have also announced collaborations with Deepseek IA models to improve public services."
“Many AI-related plans mentioned in work reports of provincial governments [from China] focus on building innovation platforms, promoting industry deeper integration and improving political staff. It is important to note that the rise of platforms such as DeepSeek reflects China's commitment to make leadership in technological advances and a greater strategic focus on talent cultivation and the existence of an innovation conducive environment, ”he reads.
The “two sessions” also constitute “a crucial platform for political legislators and counselors to present suggestions and promote ample consensus on national development” in the AI ​​area, and “some of them are executives of renowned companies and researchers”.
GDP: Maintenance
Still with regard to Chinese GDP, an analysis by Neil Thomas and Jing Qiang of the Asia Society Policy Institute argues that the “two sessions” should reveal “an even more agenda for growth than last year, with approximate objectives of five percent for GDP growth, four percent for the GDP tax deficit and two percent inflation in terms of consumption ”. "Measures should also be introduced to increase consumption and encourage the private sector in innovation," the authors write.
The same analysis of the Asia Society Policy Institute also highlights economic measures to prevent and combat unemployment, a problem that has affected the Chinese economy in recent times.
“China will also announce the annual goals for new jobs in urban areas and the urban unemployment rate. Last year, Beijing settled these objectives in 12 million new jobs and 5.5 percent unemployment rate, and this year's numbers will probably be similar, ”is mentioned.
With regard to domestic consumption, China is intended to be more and more “a hub for product launch, winter tourism and has a 'silver savings' focusing on the area of ​​restoration for an elderly population”. Also according to the analysis of the Asia Society Polycy Institute, "other priorities include rebalancing economic platform regulations, stimulating economic activity in small towns, greater integration into the area of ​​the large bay and expanding investment in maritime industries."
Attention to Investment
As “Duas Sessões” decorrem com Donald Trump de regresso à Presidência dos Estados Unidos da América e certamente que esse ponto irá marcar a agenda externa das reuniões em Pequim ao longo da semana.
Mas ainda no tocante à economia, as autoridades chinesas vão procurar apresentar e discutir medidas que possam manter a atracção de investimento estrangeiro no país, após o lançamento do “Plano de Acção para a Estabilização do Investimento Estrangeiro”, no passado dia 19 de Fevereiro.
Verifica-se, aqui, uma “mudança estratégica na abordagem de Pequim, afastando-se dos benefícios fiscais e subsídios e dirigindo-se à liberalização de sectores específicos, à racionalização da regulamentação e incentivos ao re-investimento”, apontam os mesmos analistas.
Assim sendo, Pequim pretende “enquadrar as empresas estrangeiras no quadro regulamentar da China para as transformar em partes interessadas a longo prazo, tornando a expansão local mais atractiva do que a reafectação de capitais para outros mercados”. Analysts also expect the "two sessions" to reveal concrete policies in this regard.
Sam Hou Fai in Beijing
The chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, has been in Beijing since yesterday to attend the opening ceremony of the third session of the 14th National Popular Assembly (APN), which takes place tomorrow.
Sam Hou Fai will be in the Chinese capital until Thursday of this week. According to a statement from the Social Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai will be replaced by the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, who acts interimly, the functions of Chief Executive.
In the 14th APN, the Government's work report will be reviewed and the analysis of the report on the implementation of the Annual National Economic and Social Development Plan for 2024. The agenda also includes analysis to the National Economic and Social Development Project for this year. The report on the implementation of the central and local budgets for 2024 will also be analyzed, as well as the central and local budget projects for 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 00:50:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Trips to China increase due to diversity and low prices</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/economia-viagens-a-china-aumentam-devido-a-diversidade-e-precos-baixos/</link><description>Going to China has never been so easy, fast and cheap. Two residents of Macao of Portuguese nationality reveal to HM which leads them to cross the border frequently, especially the weekend. Cultural diversity, low prices and higher quality of service in bars and restaurants make all the difference
 
Macao Small and Medium-sized (SME) have faced, since the reopening of borders in the postpandeia period, huge difficulties to recover the business, especially those that are further away from the tourist areas. At a time when traveling to China has become extremely easy and cheap, two residents explain why they prefer to move often to the neighboring city of Zhuhai, or even Shenzhen, and consume there instead of being in Macao. Options like dinner outside, catching a taxi or drinking a glass are much cheaper, and the possibility of driving outside the territory has made this option more frequent. But electronic trade has also contributed to the fall of local consumption, they ensure.
Nelson Moura, journalist and resident of Portuguese nationality, goes to Zhuhai whenever he has a free weekend or holidays. It even goes between three to four times a month. “Costs are lower inside China, and then there is the novelty factor. It has never been easy for a non -Chinese resident of Macau to go to China. I previously needed to ask for a visa, had a reduced deadline, and this greatly limited my trips, and always chose more distant places in a context of tourist travel. Local residents could go to China before, but the current convenience, with organized and developed borders, especially Hengqin, with the connection to the light meter, allows for easier connections, ”he told HM.
Since China has flexed the policy of visas and increased the offer of border circulation, traveling to the country is no longer seen as a great trip. “As a foreigner residing in Macao, going to China was a bit like going traveling to another Asian country. In the pandemic we did not go practically from Macau, but now since the policy of visas to Portuguese has been flexible, it is possible to go to China whenever we want, ”said Nelson Moura.
“I am as easily as a Chinese resident, and it has become a viable option to go to the weekends and holidays to China, knowing different sites. The food is a third of the price of what is practiced in Macau, has more quality, with fresh products, the reception offers are better. Macao is a great city, but after three years of pandemic knows very well to get out of here whenever we want. It is a more convenient option now than before. ”
Nelson Moura also considers that "for the Chinese community of Macao and Hong Kong there is a greater convenience of travel," as "there are many residents leading all weekends to China just to go to large commercial surfaces, which allows you to buy large amounts of food."
“Traffic near the border of the HKZM siege or bridge is at a level never seen before. There is the option of being able to drive in the large bay zone which is good for small and expensive cities like are Macau and Hong Kong, ”he said.
PME, the eternal problem
On the side of Macau, associations linked to the Chinese community's commercial sector call for help, asking for more measures such as the great consumption award, or even consumer cards, that is, more campaigns and initiatives so that residents can buy more in Macao with discounts or support.
One of the last voices showing concern about this scenario was Stanley Au, president of the Macao SME association. To TDM Canal Macau, the official argued that in the next lines of government action the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, has to show effective measures to avoid closing and, consequently, more unemployment. “The most urgent and current situation is the closure of companies. I believe the population saw many stores closed in different neighborhoods of the territory. Sometimes, on the same street, there are more stores closed than opened. In addition, the biggest problem is that Macau is facing continuous economic slowdown. If we do not solve this problem, society does not improve, ”he added.
However, according to Nelson Moura, it will always be difficult to combat the attraction of the consumption of Greater China. “Macao's local commerce is a complicated issue. There is a major reduction in consumers, especially on weekends and days when people have time to leave the city. ”
Electronic trade also enhances a reduction in local consumption. “Residents know they find more and cheaper out there. There are Chinese electronic trade companies, such as TAOBAO, which allow purchases from all over China to Macao without transportation charges, which has reduced domestic consumption. People go to stores to see what they want to buy and then do it at Taobao. I don't know how this trend can be circumvented. It is capitalism to work, ”explained Nelson Moura.
The resident also draws attention to the fact that it is now easier to use online payment platforms in China with foreign cards or Macao banks, namely through MPay.
Nelson Moura believes that local SMEs have only endured so much time because they were in a kind of closed economic circuit. “Local businesses lived a little in an island economy, and they survived the fact that the Macao market is in the territory, without people could leave so much. Now that there has been competition with what China has to offer, companies suffer because they often don't offer the service so much quality and at such an attractive price. I know the situation in Hong Kong is similar. ”
“Like” in China
Macaense Miguel Rosa Duque has always worked in Macau and spent in the territory most of the days of the week, but since he started teaching in Zhuhai his life has become more across the border. Highlights the much cheaper night exits as well as the restoration offer. “Macao has no variety and people are filled with the fact that the territory is small. We have hotels and restaurants, but they are expensive because the lace are expensive. Faced with China, in terms of price, the difference is like between heaven and earth. I give an example: To take a taxi from the siege gates to the university where I teach it is 40 minutes of travel, 28 kilometers, and paid about 60 to 80 Renminbis. It's very cheap. In Macao, from the doors of the siege to Coloane we pay 150 patacas or more, the price difference is huge. ”
Miguel Rosa Duque says that the trips to China in her circle of friends have become so frequent that they even created a group on the WhatsApp social network to facilitate group walks. “I prefer to go to China a thousand times just for fun. I have a lot of variety of bars and nightclubs and in Macau everything is dead. A two -person massage costs 600 Renminbis in Macao costs twice. I don't talk about hotel massage. Customer service is much better in China, with more attention to customers, more attentive, and it's all cheaper. If we spend 1000 patacas on a night in Macao, China we spend 400 Renminbis and we are treated like kings. The variety is infinite in terms of restaurants. Macau can't compete, ”he said.
Miguel Rosa Duque says he has friends who, even with a car in Macau, eventually acquired another Chinese enrollment car who are parked in the border parking park because it is cheaper to rent a place to park.
Macanese understands that between local SMEs and trade in China “there is no possible competition”, especially with online sales platforms. “People no longer go to stores here, there are a thousand choices and you can buy it from home. My girlfriend rarely goes to the supermarket, does everything online, for example, ”he added.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Teaching | Chinese universities rise in ranking by disciplines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/ensino-universidades-chinesas-sobem-em-ranking-por-disciplinas/</link><description>Chinese universities have risen at the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025” in various areas, although in arts and humanities Asia remains short of other continents. In 11 disciplines analyzed, such as Law, Management and Economics, China and Singapore are in the 50 best, while Hong Kong stands out in Education Studies
 
The latest world ranking of higher education by areas of knowledge of Times Higher Education, the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025”, concludes that universities in the interior of China have climbed to top positions, although Asia continues to position themselves in the areas of arts and humanities.
In total, 11 academic areas were analyzed. “Arts and Humanities”, “Business and Economics”, “Computer Science”, “Education Studies”, “Engineering”, “Law”, “Life Sciences”, “Medicine and Health”, “Physical Sciences”, “Psychology” and “Social Sciences”.
It is concluded, according to an official note from Times Higher Education (The), that “China and Singapore appear among the 50 best in all 11 subjects”, especially the University of Beijing and Tsinghua University, respectively, for fourth and sex places in “business and economy” disciplines. In fact, “Asia's best performance is registered in the areas of management and economics”, with “its main universities to continue to have difficulty competing worldwide in the field of arts and humanities”. "Concerns about the 'crisis' in humanities seem to be designed to continue this year, but the analysis of The reveals the continuous importance to elite institutions."
Given the analysis of 11 academic areas, the neighboring region of Hong Kong stands out in nine, especially in the area of ​​education, where the University of Beijing and Tsinghua also achieved good results. “The National University of Singapore again occupies the ninth position in Engineering, entering the top 10 of the physical sciences-the first institution in Asia to achieve it-in 10th place,” is also read.
Quoted by the same grade, Simon Marginson, professor at Oxford University, an institution that usually leads rankings worldwide, said that Asia's performance in this classification shows “the multipolar world of higher education” existing today, with greater amplification “national academic capacity”.
"In this context, over time, the relative position of Anglosfera countries and Western Europe must decrease, not because its absolute quality is decreasing, but because the field of comparison is more filled with other countries to emerge," he said.
The same responsible also pointed out that "East Asia and Southeast Asian higher education systems have improved over the past two decades due to the growth in the number of students, increased public funding, more performance -oriented organization and management and selective internationalization policies."
One of the areas where there is a better position of Asian universities is in education studies, showing “a remarkable force, with three universities in the top 10, with the University of Hong Kong in sixth place, the University of Tsinghua in seventh place and the university of Beijing in eighth place”. In addition, The Show that the Chinese University of Hong Kong has made “significant progress” from 19th to 11th position. On the other hand, the Taiwan National University of Science and Technology (Taiwan Tech) obtained "the highest score in terms of research quality."
However, global leadership goes to Stanford University, "surpassing the University of California, Berkeley, demonstrating exceptional performance in both teaching and research environment."
China rises in law
Looking at the area of ​​law, there is currently, according to the ranking of The, the best place to study than Stanford University, which has achieved “excellence in teaching and research environment”, followed by Harvard University, with “exceptional performance” and, thirdly, the University of New York, “with the highest score in terms of research environment”.
Highlight, in this area, for the entrance of the University of Beijing in 14th position, in part due to the good classification “in teaching and the research environment”. It should be noted that, as regards the law, 389 institutions from 48 countries and territories were classified, using 18 “strict performance indicators”.
In the area of ​​law, specialties are analyzed such as constitutional and administrative law and examination to structures and frameworks of governance, or international law, which includes global legal systems and treaties.
Capital Knowledge
China also stands out in business and economy, led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The University of Beijing rose to fourth place, accompanied by 20 other Chinese universities that improved their positions in the table. In this area were analyzed 990 institutions from 85 countries and territories, with the attention focusing on the quality of teaching and research in disciplines such as strategic leadership, international business and organizational development, as well as business finances or economic.
With regard to the social sciences, China actually comes below the list of the top 20, again with the University of Beijing in 16th and the University of Tsinghua in 20th. Here, the lead is up to MIT, passing Stanford University for the third to call Oxford, with "exceptional performance in teaching and research environment." The London School of Economics and Political Science remains an integral institution of the top 10, now occupying ninth place.
1,093 institutions from 100 countries and territories were analyzed in disciplines such as media communication and studies, politics and international studies, including development studies, sociology, geography and anthropology.
China also rose in the discipline of Computer Science with the University of Beijing to move from 16th to 12th place. In this area, leads the University of Oxford, reaching its highest score ever.
MIT Leads in Arts
The MIT has been at the head of Stanford University, assuming “first place in arts and humanities, as well as business, economy and social sciences”, even if it is first recognized “by specialization in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics”. According to the ranking, it is now “the best place to study arts - with high scores in each of the five pillars underlying the methodology, especially the quality of the investigation and the international perspective”.
In the 11 disciplines of the ranking, "Stanford ranked first in education, law and psychology studies, Harvard University ranked first in engineering and life sciences."
The only local institution in the ranking of The Disciplines is the University of Macao (one), but in places far below top 10: in the area of ​​computational sciences, it is in the 126-150 best in the world, a similar position occupied in the area of ​​education and engineering. In the area of ​​law, for example, one is in the best group of 176-200, while in life sciences is among the 151-175 best.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 04:59:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Pass | Controversial card exchange due to collection</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/14/macau-pass-troca-de-cartao-polemica-devido-a-cobranca/</link><description>After an elderly man complaining about requested 50 patacas to change Macau Pass, the government said that from today there are no charges, after announcing that the exchange was free. As for the request to sign lists for the elections, the executive assured HM that if he is aware of irregularities will end card exchange posts
 
After a complaint on Monday that an elderly woman was invited to signing a candidacy report for legislative elections when she exchanged the Macau Pass card to the elderly to participate in the great consumption award in a local association, yesterday the process again got to know a new episode.
Once again, in the Macao Macao Forum Program of the Radio Macao Chinese channel, an elderly man complained of being charged 50 patacas to change the Macau Pass card to the elderly that allows you to participate in the program for discounts and incentive for consumption consumption consumption. The case occurred in a Macau Pass store where the employee will have informed the resident that he would be exchanged in one of about 60 exchange posts in social services and local associations the service would be free.
It is recalled that at the end of last week, the day the card exchange began, the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) issued a statement informing that “the treatment of replacement formalities” was free. Also the request for a temporary card would have no charges. “If the elderly need to use the card during the replacement period, Macau Pass will provide them with free temporary use card”, even at Macau Pass service centers.
After the complaint, DSEDT clarified that the 50 patacas charged would be returned in the balance of the new card. In addition, the government negotiated with Macau Pass to, starting today, finish the pre-ability of fees to change cards.
Electoral little leg
In addition to the collection of 50 patacas, the exchange of cards and the request of temporary cards that is made exclusively at Macau Pass stores has been criticized by the long lines it has generated. Deputy Pereira Coutinho was one of the voices that denounced the situation.
On the other hand, when the card exchange service was only three business days, a resident claimed that his grandmother was invited to sign a candidacy report to legislative elections while trying to change the Macau Pass card to the elderly in a local association.
HM contacted all public services involved (Institute of Social Action, Commission on Electoral Affairs of the Legislative Assembly and DSEDT), to find out if any investigation related to electoral actions would be underway during the exchange of the elderly cards, and what the consequences, and only obtained response from DSEDT. The body led by Yau Yun Wah began by mentioning that DSEDT organized training sessions and clarification for "collaborating entities regarding elderly card replacement procedures."
In addition, DSEDT said it had elaborated "Operation and Confidentiality Guidelines" and requested "employees of all service posts that fulfilled them rigorously."
Regarding the request to sign candidates' propositions during card exchange, DSEDT points out that it has “remembered its employees that they should be conferenceed with residents assistance in replacing cards, limiting only the service available to card replacement”. Communication that DSEDT guaranteed HM, in an email sent late Wednesday afternoon, was reiterated "a few days ago."
Regarding possible consequences of electoral use of associations in the work of replacement of cards, the government guaranteed the HM that it will be aware. "DSEDT will continue to supervise all service posts, and if you check the violation of guidelines in any of these, you will immediately cease the card replacement service provided by the service station involved," he was added.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 02:10:35</pubDate></item><item><title>“Two Sessions” | Sam Hou Fai promises “concrete actions”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/14/duas-sessoes-sam-hou-fai-promete-accoes-concretas/</link><description>The chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, promises to hold "concrete actions" in Macao to "transform the spirit of the" two sessions "and the words of the Chinese leaders into practical actions, defended yesterday in a speech given at the" Two Sessions "transmission session of the National People's Assembly (APN) and this year's Chinese people's Political Consultative Conference (CCPPC).
Sam Hou Fai said the messages transmitted in the "two sessions" will "tirelessly open new development horizons to Macao in the context of participation and support for Chinese modernization, thus contributing even more significantly to the construction of a large country and national revitalization."
It is intended, for example, to “introduce new concepts of governance, to improve the forms of government action and to intensify communication and cooperation with society”, implementing “fully the principle of Macau ruled by patriots”. The ruler also said that will be taken to "deepen the reform of the public administration, reinforce coordination and concertation, and comprehensively raise government effectiveness."

Deputy Lei Chan U wants the government to present the measures that will be adopted to realize the policy of exploitation of health tourism. The question is part of a written interpellation, and comes after the islands hospital has been operating in September last year.
According to the deputy, the executive indicated that the way to explore health tourism was the creation of partnerships between the authorities, the concessionaires and the different medical services. However, a legislator linked to the Macau Workers' Federation (Faom) considers that it is necessary to make more information available on what is really intended for the sector and how the objectives will be fulfilled: “What is the point of situation about the use of the Macao Union Medical Medical Center College Hospital as a catalyst to attract more health tourists and promote the development of this sector in Macao?” questions the deputy of the workers. “And what concrete measures were adopted by the government to actually apply these plans?” He adds.
According to the understanding of Chan U law, with the Operating Islands Hospital since September 2024 it is necessary to “gradually reinforce its role and its functions in promoting the development of the sector”.
Day -hospitals
In addition to asking for written interplies that it goes from paper to reality, law Chan U questions the executive about the plans to create the so -called “hospitals of the day”.
Initially presented last year, the idea is to create new health facilities in the licensing system, which occupy an intermediate function, between clinics and hospitals. According to the molds presented, and cited by Chan U law, the creation of the new health units implies the alteration of the licensing regime of health institutions. And the government has promised a new public consultation in this regard. However, developments have not yet been found. As such, law asks for a point of the situation: “Administration indicated that it will launch a public consultation about the increase in the number of licenses for hospitals in the first quarter of 2025. What is the point of the situation of the preparatory work of the public consultation? When is the start of public consultation expected? ”, He interrogates.
Presented as one of the major health projects in Macao, Hospital das Islands opened last year in September. However, contrary to what was expected is not a public hospital, and management was delivered to a private entity, the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. When they want to use these services, residents have to pay like any tourist or other client. The only way to be cared for equal to those of the public sector happens when residents are referred to this hospital for health services.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 01:52:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Ecology | Sam hu fai plant tree in the small mud</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/13/ecologia-sam-hou-fai-planta-arvore-na-taipa-pequena/</link><description>To commemorate the “National Tree Planting Day of China”, the chief executive yesterday planted a Machilus Chinensis tree on the Taipa small rail.

The exit is scheduled for next week. Chan Un Tong is the man who follows in the one who is one of the "hottest" chairs of the Mand administration
 
Chan Un Tong was promoted to the Director of the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL). The choice of the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP, was revealed yesterday through the official bulletin and has effects on Tuesday next week.
The decision represents a promotion for Chan Un Tong, which has been Since 2016 DSal's subdirector. The changes were justified by the “vacancy of office”, although the current director, Wong Chi Hong, will keep up to be replaced, and even with the fact that the secretary has considered that Chan has “professional competence and aptitude for the position of Director”.
Chan Un Tong has a degree in Economic Law at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Jinan in Canton. In addition, he attended an introduction course to Macao Law at the University of Macao Faculty of Law.
In professional terms, Chan was a technical assistant to the Directorate of Justice Services between August 2002 and August 2005. It was this year that he moved to Dsal, assuming the position of Technician, until May 2007.

End of the route
The information released yesterday also means that Wong Chi Hong's time in front of Dsal came to an end after almost 13 years. This is a service direction always greatly given to criticism of local deputies and associations due to authorization skills in hiring non -resident workers. The reason for the substitution has not yet been indicated, but Wong will be able to reform.
In 2012, when he assumed the current tasks, Wong Chi Hong was a coordinator of the Human Resources Cabinet, after being for several years of the Secretary's Office Advisor to Economics and Finance, Francis Tam.

The position consists of an article published yesterday in the newspaper or world.
According to Cheung Kin Chung's statements, authorities should adopt a more multifaceted stance on efforts to attract international tourists with greater purchasing power to promote “sustained tourism development”.
The president of the Macao Hotelers Association states that the efforts of the Tourism Services Directorate (STD) to participate in events in Spain, United Arab Emirates, Japan or South Korea are positive. However, they are not enough, and for Cheung the promotion of Macau as a tourist destination without creating better international calls will always have a limited impact.
At the level of calls, Cheung also asks authorities that they are not limited to short -term connections with surrounding countries and regions, but bet on bringing tourists from other more distant markets, but with great consumption capacity.
At the same time, the associative leader requested greater coordination between the government, game concessionaires, companies and aviation companies in this effort of greater internationalization in the market.
Last year, according to the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services, the territory received 34.93 million visitors, including 2.42 million international visitors, a proportion of 7 percent.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 03:44:05</pubDate></item><item><title>National Security | More than 25,000 students participate in competitions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/seguranca-nacional-mais-de-25-mil-alunos-participam-em-concursos/</link><description>The winners of the composition and short film contests “my notion about the security of society” were chosen, the social communication office yesterday.

I can't explain the delay. It is a complex and emotionally demanding theme. I am perplexed to see how, in my social circles, the legitimacy of the Palestinian struggle is widely recognized, while in other spaces, any support for the Palestinian people is quickly confused with an anti-Semitic attitude.
We live in an extreme world, where division persists into parallel realities, with no room for dialogue. And so the critical situation continues. What else can I say, but I feel revolt? Season my food with Za'Atar every day as a symbolic gesture to keep the conscience of a people who suffers from hunger and deprivation alive. We have seen an unprecedented ethnic cleansing, and Palestinian occupation, refugee camps and rubble are the epicenter of sociopolitical degradation of the modern world.
On Women's Day, I had the opportunity to listen to Shahd Wadi, a researcher and writer Palestinian, who has exploited the occupation and the arts as a form of witness to women's lives and experiences. Recently, he launched the poetry book “Rain of Jasmine”, where experiences and languages ​​are intertwined. Shahd chose Portugal as a refuge while awaiting the day when he can return to his family village, where his grandmother was forced from 1948. In this informal conversation, fundamental issues were discussed: women's narratives, the imposition of Western feminism that insists on seeing the Arab woman as a victim, the body as a memory instrument of an extermination.
The concept of intersectionality proves essential in this context, as it allows us to understand the resistance of a people in parallel with the social emancipation of women. It is a struggle against occupation, injustice and systemic violence. The stories shared by Shahd Wadi brought a new light to the way we perceive the creativity and resilience of Palestinian women. Like that woman who, seeing a man being arrested by Israeli soldiers, gives her baby to her arms and stages a discussion, pretending to be fed up with her husband's constant arrests, leaving her alone with the child. The soldiers, disconcerted with the situation, free it. The man returns the baby to this woman, who had never seen before. Or as, in the face of the threat of violation, some women say goodbye, destroying the pleasure that the aggressors expect to obtain by stealing their honor.
To reflect on the resistance of Palestinian women is also to recognize how their body has become a war target. It is the body that generates and ensures the continuity of a people at risk of extermination. Restrictions on access to sexual and reproductive health care are not accidental. A checkpoint can prevent a woman from arriving at the hospital to give birth, endangering the life of the baby and mother. Small details such as this highlight the insidious dimension of the ongoing ethnic cleaning process.
Shahd Wadi shared these and many other stories, assuming an essential role in preserving the Palestinian experience. He gave us permission to make them ours, integrating them into our political imagination of struggle and resistance. On Women's Day, and in so many others, who reflect on Palestinian women who continue to resist, not only for the right to decide on their bodies and future, but also for the right to exist with dignity, freedom and sovereignty.
His struggle is a testimony of courage and resilience and reminds us that feminism, anywhere in the world, must adapt to local realities. His stories and experiences are part of the struggle for the freedom of the Palestinian people, a struggle that belongs to all.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 02:43:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Geogostronomy and Artificial Intelligence</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/13/geogastronomia-e-a-inteligencia-artificial-2/</link><description>The complex interaction of these perspectives reflects the broader debates in the world of cooking, addressing the way food systems can evolve by respecting cultural identities. The relationship between geogostronomy and AI is illustrated through several innovative case studies.
A convincing example is the domain of personalized nutrition. Emerging technologies use AI to analyze individual eating preferences, health metrics and genetic predispositions. Companies like Nutrigenomix use AI to adapt nutritional advice based on DNA analysis, emphasizing a more individualized food approach that takes into account both geographical context and personal health.
Another remarkable effort is the development of smart kitchens. Companies like Samsung and LG have introduced AI -based cooking devices that help prepare meals and suggestion of recipes.
These intelligent devices can offer personalized recipes based on available ingredients, improving cooking experience and reducing food waste. This innovation not only simplifies meals preparation, but also encourages consumers to explore local and seasonal ingredients. In addition, AI -based platforms, such as Tock, allow kitchen restorers to analyze customer data to improve service and adapt menus to preference evolution.
This adaptability, driven by data perception, illustrates the way AI can transform traditional business models in the cooking sector, while falling into the geographical context of gastronomic experience. Despite promising developments in the intersection between geogostronomy and AI, significant challenges and limitations persist. Concerns about data privacy raise ethical questions regarding consumer information.
As AI analyzes personal eating habits, protection of these data becomes fundamental. There is also the risk of exacerbating inequalities in access to food if technology becomes too centralized or if smaller producers do not have the resources to compete.
In addition, dependence on data -based approaches can overshadow the importance of human creativity in the kitchen. Although data can guide cooking innovation, the art of cooking is often a matter of experimentation and instinct.
As chefs adopt AI tools, they should remain vigilant to preserve the essence and joy of cooking creativity. The future of geogostronomy and AI depends on a synergistic approach that respects both technological and culinary advances. Educational initiatives centered on the integration of food studies with technology can pave the way to a new generation of cooking professionals equipped to navigate this evolving landscape.
Universities and cooking schools can incorporate IA training together with traditional culinary education to produce well -prepared and familiar chefs with both domains. In addition, collaboration efforts between technology creators, chefs and farmers can lead to more sustainable practices.
By using AI to address food transportation, waste management, and facility strategies, stakeholders can create a more efficient food system that respects local flavors and cultures. Finally, the implementation of AI in community agriculture is promising. Located AI initiatives can offer farmers information about climate data, crop rotation standards and market trends, thus promoting resilience against environmental challenges.
By improving local food networks, communities can become more self-sufficient, simultaneously promoting the rich exclusive agricultural heritage of their regions. The intersection between geogostronomy and AI is a dynamic domain and full of opportunities. Understanding how geographical factors influence the kitchen and by integrating AI technologies, we can promote cooking innovation, simultaneously respecting cultural heritage.
The synergy between tradition and technology has the potential to redefine our culinary landscape, paving the way to sustainable practices and improved gastronomic experiences. Ultimately, as this interdisciplinary dialogue continues, the world of cooking is in the forefront of transforming change, combining taste with technology in a way that enriches our global food culture.</description><pubDate>2025-03-13 01:51:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Planet X</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/planeta-x/</link><description>- Each man has the exact number of children before the alphabet he should conceive before he even learned his linguistic composition.

The first stream claims that benificaries should live in Macau at least 183 days a year to enjoy this check in the amount of 10,000 patacas. However, those who live in the Great Bay area would not be covered by this measure.
The second current believes that a timeline should be created, where the conditions will be different. This method can be synthesized in this way, "for the new residents the new system, for the old residents the old system." This will also be a way to reduce the expenses of the pecuniary check distribution plan.
The third lawyer is that instead of surrendering checks should be placed at 10,000 Patacas on consumer cards to encourage residents to make their purchases in Macao, thus encouraging the city's economy, benefiting the population and helping to increase government revenues from taxes.
Before analyzing these three currents of opinion, it is necessary to understand the government's financial situation. In September 2024, the financial reserves were approximately 617 billion. In the budget for 2025, it is expected that the executive's revenues will be about 121 billion patacas, the expenses will be around 113.3 billion and the gross profit from the game sector will be in 240 billion. Based on this calculation, by 2025, the government will have a financial surplus and tax reserves may cover about five years of expenses, which indicates signs of stability.
So why did these currents of opinion emerged? Because before the pandemic, revenues from the game sector taxing that reached the 300 billion of patacas annually fell by over 200 billion during the epidemic. This value was slowly recovering and reached 230 billion in 2024, so the budget surplus was very reduced. According to the “living within our possibilities” principle stipulated in the Macao Basic Law, the government must consider the reasonable way to cut in expenses, which will comply with the provisions of the Basic Law.
Although the measures that defend these three currents reduce the funds that the government allocates to the implementation of the plan, its essence, as an important policy to support the subsistence of residents, it is allowing everyone to share the fruits of economic development, increasing their sense of belonging and satisfaction. As long as you have a Macao Identity Ticket and if you are a city resident, part of the shared money can be received. Therefore, the imposition of any kind of conditions could compromise the equity and inclusion of the plan. As soon as a situation is established in which “some have no right and others” will certainly create social dissatisfaction and controversy.
In order to maintain the essence, objective and characteristics of the plan, as much as possible taking into account the government's financial capabilities, the fairer form is that the setbacks and the advances focus on all residents. If the amount of pecuniary checks fall from the current 10,000 patacas, it will be in accordance with the principle “Living within our possibilities”, but being equitable, it will affect the lowest income families and is not feasible. Also, with a tax surplus and large tax reserves, why not consider the possibility of increasing the value of pecuniary checks instead of reducing it?
With the reduction of tax revenues, it is natural for the government to save by optimizing expenses and improving the effectiveness of tax funds. At the same time, the government should also actively explore the path of moderate economic diversification, reduce game industry dependence and increase revenue. E como é que isso pode ser feito na prática?
Recently, mainland China has resumed the policy “a visa, multiple trips”, which has undoubtedly injected a new vitality in the economic recovery of the Macao Tourism sector. The government must take this opportunity to increase advertising and promote efforts to attract more tourists. It should also simultaneously encourage stores to innovate their business model, develop special products and improve the quality of service to meet the different needs of tourists.
The government estimates that by 2025 Macao receives 36 million tourists. The city organized several successful concerts in 2024, which not only brought considerable economic benefits to the region, but also gave new ideas for the functioning of the moderate diversification of the economy. The government must continue to support and encourage this way and also exploit similar cultural tourism projects to promote the region's prosperity. Only increasing tax revenues can the plan remain unchanged and all continue to receive their part and enjoy good economic results.
In short, as an important subsistence support policy, the continuation of implementation and the improvement of the plan are of great importance to increase the sense of belonging and satisfaction of residents. When the government faces tax pressures such as reducing the game sector, it should adopt a prudent attitude and seek fair and reasonable solutions to ensure that the plan continues to play the role due to it. If government revenues return to pre-standard levels, the question of modifying the plan will naturally disappear.

The idea is to "promote the practice of skateboarding and improve its culture."
The park is located at the H853 Outdoor Event Space and will be managed by this association, starting the operation, still experimental, from Saturday. According to a statement, this space is intended to become a "privileged destination for radical sports enthusiasts, further enriching Macao's sports and leisure offers."
It is understood that this initiative, linked to radical sports, “aligns with Macao's strategy vision of Turismo + Sports, promoting synergies between cultural tourism and various experiences”, and reinforces “Macao's appeal as a dynamic and multifaceted destination”.
The entity that will manage this park is a collective of four associations, namely the Macao Skate Development Association, the Macao Skate Exchange and Learning Association and the Macao Skate Association. With this inauguration, it is expected to "develop the practice of skateboarding and its growth, involving more enthusiasts of Macao," in order to "bring joy to Macao, whether the skateboard is a sport or a form of cultural expression."</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 02:39:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Glass House | Exhibition on Portuguese opened Tuesday</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/14/casa-de-vidro-exposicao-sobre-portugues-inaugurada-terca-feira/</link><description>The 10 Marias Cultural Association presents, next week, another project. This is the exhibition “Portuguese, a global language”, which will be evident in the TAP Seac Glass House from Tuesday. The show is inspired by the work “Novo Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, launched in 2016, revealing the presence of the Portuguese language worldwide
 
It is inaugurated next Tuesday, from 18:30, another exhibition of the initiative of the 10 Marias Cultural Association. It is “Portuguese, a global language: exploring the reach and influence of the Portuguese language”, which can be seen in the glass house of TAP Seac. This show has the support of the Government Culture Development Fund and the House of Portugal in Macau.
According to a statement, the initiative “offers an in-depth exploitation of the presence and influence of the Portuguese language in the world, connecting cultures, economies and communities”, inspired by the work “Novo Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, launched in 2016 with the authorship of Luís Antero Reto, Fernando Luís Machado and José Paulo Esperança. The work is available in Portuguese, Chinese and English.
With this show, it is intended to present “a multidisciplinary perspective on Portuguese, highlighting its historical evolution, geographical expansion and cultural importance”. “As one of the most globally spoken languages, Portuguese is a dynamic and constantly changing heritage, shaped by its speakers on various continents,” he adds.
Presence of the author
10 Marias considers that the work of Luís Reto “has been fundamental in the documentation of the global influence of language”, and “its presence [at the inauguration of the exhibition] will provide a valuable view of the importance of Portuguese in the current world”.
In the glass house, visitors “can discover the impact of language in various areas, including their demographic range, their role in education and their economic relevance as a language of business and commerce”. It is also explored “Portuguese as a diplomatic tool, a means of artistic and scientific expression, and as a key actor in digital communication”.
Macao, “a city where the East finds the West”, thus becomes the ideal place to present “Portuguese, a global language”, a cultural project where it “celebrates language as a unifying and, at the same time, diverse force”.
The organization also considers that the show “reflects on the role of Portuguese as a bridge between nations, promoting mobility, cultural exchange and international collaboration”. “More than a means of communication, Portuguese is a shared heritage that continues to expand its influence on the global scenario. This exhibition invites visitors to explore the past, present and future of language, enjoying the richness and diversity of a truly global language, ”the organization stresses.
It should be noted that Luís Reto is in Macao regarding a lecture at the Rui Cunha Foundation that will take place next Monday. From 6.30 pm the session of the “Wheel of Ideas” cycle, entitled “The Potential of the Portuguese Language in the Contemporary World” can be heard. Luís Reto was a rector of ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon, Luís Reto, being accompanied in the conversation by the Associate Rector of the Faculty of Business of the University of Macao, José Paulo Esperança, also linked to the exhibition that performs at the Glass House.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 02:34:29</pubDate></item><item><title>CCCM | Put new edition of the Conference Cycle on Macao, China and Asia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/13/cccm-arranca-nova-edicao-do-ciclo-de-conferencias-sobre-macau-china-e-asia/</link><description>The Macau Scientific and Cultural Center receives another edition of the “Spring Conferences”, a cycle of conferences with speakers and academics about Macau, China and Asia, which aims to present the latest studies in the areas of political science, history or anthropology, among others.

SS consider that they have met the “all needs” of the victim and family in a timely manner
 
The two -year -old girl passed away who had been hit by debris projected by an explosion in Taiwan. Although the death happened on Friday at the Conde São Januário Hospital Center, the information was released on Wednesday night by the Taiwan media.
The case dates back to February 13, when a family with seven macao elements was touring Taichung and was hit by several objects projected to the street due to an explosion on the 12th floor of a shopping center. That day, two residents were declared dead, the family grandparents of the family. However, the two -year -old girl, granddaughter of the other deadly victims, stood in a coma, with brain injuries, linked to the machine and fighting for life.
The girl was transported to Macao on February 26, always remaining in a coma, and hospitalized at the Conde São Januário Hospital Center. On Friday night, March 7, it died. The information was communicated to Taiwan's media by the man who on the day of the accident helped transport the urgent girl to the hospital.
However, death information was not communicated in Macau. The information was only made public, then news has been advanced by the Taiwan media, where the case is still being investigated and promises many developments, because of the need to determine responsibilities about the accident and paid compensation to the victims' families. From the accident, with regard to victims of Macao, four other injuries were resulted in no problem.
Behind the injury
With the information of Taiwan's social communication agencies to be released on social networks, and reaching some local media agencies, health services ended up issuing a statement at dawn on Thursday in Chinese. The information in Portuguese was only made available in the morning.
"Health services reported that, after obtaining the consent of the family, it was now announced that the girl from Macao who was injured in the previous explosion of gas in Taichung died at Conde de S. Januario Hospital on the 7th of this month," was confirmed.
The authorities also defended the quality of services provided to the victim and family: “Health services expressed deep regret for the girl's death and presented the deepest condolences to her family, emotional support and care services to family members were also provided and their needs in time,” he was added.
Online criticism
With the news of the death by Taiwan's communication agencies, several online comments emerged to regret the succeeded and wish the condolences to the family.
However, the posture of Macau's government and social communication agencies was also the target of various criticisms, given the misunderstanding of the fact of the outcome of this case, which was highly media, was only known through the Taiwan media organs.
In some of the most popular conversation groups of the territory in traditional Chinese, the lack of transparency of the Government of Masters was lamented and the willingness of the media to report events outside the government agenda.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 02:24:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Dsal | Work vacancies at Shake Shack and Barbie Love</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/14/dsal-vagas-de-trabalho-no-shake-shack-e-barbie-love/</link><description>The Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) will organize three sessions of jobs, providing a total of 224 vacancies, on March 20, 21 and 24, to restoration sectors, retail trade and supermarkets, building administration and cleaning.

The Power of the People's Association defends the creation of a working group to control price fluctuations linked to oil -derived products in Macao. The position was taken by President Lam Weng Ioi, through a letter delivered to the executive headquarters.
According to the message released yesterday, the association considers it "evident" that prices need to be regulated because they "keep" always "very high", with an average of over 14 patacas per liter of gasoline, although the price of Crude suffers several fluctuations.
From the perspective of the association directed by LAM, the need for supervision becomes even clearer, when the prices practiced are very similar to those charged at other times when the price of oil was much higher. "Increasing prices of these first -need goods is invariably to increase population charges," he is argued.
Therefore, the Power of the People's Association suggests a group to “monitor and control the prices” of oil derivatives, and especially those of goods or services with the highest impact on the life of the population, such as the price of fuel, transport, communications and electricity. “Relevant companies must be subject to licensing and supervision,” was nominated.
The Association also indicates that companies "exploring public services must be required to disclose prices and limit their profits, and their financial data should be audited and published." "The government should evaluate the prices and operational performance of the companies in question and regularly review licenses, as well as introduce more competitors through regular public tenders," he was added.
Eternal struggle
Also in the letter the association is insisted on one of its main flags, the control of issuing authorizations for non -resident workers.
"According to the complaints of our members, some companies controlled or supervised by public services, such as parking parks or other services subcontracted by public services, are full of non -resident workers, for work such as cleaning, condominium management and even engineering," he was nominated.
"We do not support the discrimination of non -resident workers, but the government should take the initiative to encourage these companies to hire more resident workers, especially in the current economic situation," he was stressed. "The priority of local workers in access to employment should not just be an empty slogan," was concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 02:17:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Flora Garden | Ice rink completed this month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/14/jardim-da-flora-pista-de-gelo-concluida-este-mes/</link><description>The Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) has revealed that the construction works of an ice rink for children in the garden of Flora will be completed this month.

The information was revealed yesterday by the second commander of the Fire Department, Lam Chon Sang, to the microphones of the Macau Macau forum program.
Among the more than 1,200 fractions where problems were encountered, the person in charge said that the most frequent risks were defective connections between gas cylinders to stoves and water drivers, lack of ventilation or installation in inappropriate places, and damaged hoses or outside the expiration date.
“We have started inspections in housing since July 2019, because there were a lot of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning not only in Macao, but also in neighboring areas. Until February this year, we made 1,742 inspections and only about 530 had perfect conditions, ”said Lam Chon Sang.
The second CB commander put water in boiling and relativized what “appears to be the large number of houses” with danger of gas escape, noting that residents or owners do not mark inspections with gas or maintenance suppliers.
Lam Chon Sang took the opportunity to appeal to residents the use of the open line, or contact on the official Firefighters page, to mark inspections to gas facilities.</description><pubDate>2025-03-13 01:36:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Medicines | Detected store involved in illegal distribution</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/13/medicamentos-detectada-loja-envolvida-em-distribuicao-ilegal/</link><description>The action of the authorities took place on Wednesday, and resulted in the seizure of more than 500 boxes of antiviral drugs for hepatitis B and hypoglycemic injections. The targets risk a fine that can reach 700 thousand patacas
 
Authorities announced that they have detected a store at the doors of the siege, which was dedicated to the distribution of imported drugs to the territory without legal authorization. The case was revealed on Wednesday night through a statement from the Institute for Pharmaceutical Supervision and Administration (Isaf) and Customs Services (SA).
According to information released, the authorities "performed a joint action and seized more than 500 boxes of antiviral drugs for Hepatitis B and hypoglycemic injections that had not been registered and approved for import by Isaf."
Hypoglycemic injections are used by people with diabetes, a condition that is characterized by very high levels of blood sugar. Hepatitis B is a viral disease that tends to affect the liver and can evolve into other diseases such as cirrhosis or even liver cancer. It can be transmitted by sharing syringes, sex and other blood contacts.
The store, identified as a “commercial agency in the siege ports”, was “involved in supplying drugs without license and illegal imports of medicines”.
After the operation, ISAF filed a lawsuit for investigation of this case, while the SA "proceeded to the accusation against the store official regarding the violation of the provisions of product importation."
Fine up to 700 thousand patacas
After the disclosure of the case, Isaf and SAs made a statement to ensure that “combat illegal activities by sharing information, communication and interdepartmental collaboration”.
In addition, a warning has been alerted to offenders that may be required to pay fines and even take on criminal liability. "According to the legislation in force regarding pharmaceutical activities, only license -granted establishments can be provided by Isaf," he was explained. “In addition, the importation of drugs is also subject to prior authorization and import license granted by Isaf. The offender may be punished with a fine of up to 700,000 patacas and for serious circumstances, the offender may assume criminal liability, ”he was added.
The Isaf also asked residents to be aware of the existence of unauthorized sales places, or when they are sold without the import license, to report situations to the authorities.</description><pubDate>2025-03-13 01:34:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Former Stanley Hoterreno on the market for $ 88 million from Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/13/ex-terreno-de-stanley-ho-no-mercado-por-88-milhoes-de-dolares-de-hong-kong/</link><description>Land in Hong Kong, which is part of the heritage left to family members by Stanley Ho, was put up for sale for $ 88 million from Hong Kong, according to the HK01 portal.
The land is located on Kimberley Street in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, and the managers of the Magnata inheritance intend to receive about 55,800 dollars from Hong Kong for each of the 1,572 meters of construction allowed on site.
The sale was decided by the KPMG Financial Services Company, appointed heritage manager left by Magnata. The choice of this company was made by Pansy Ho, daughter of Stanley with the second wife, Lucina Laam. However, the decision was far from peaceful, and was eventually contested in the courts by Angela Ho, daughter of Stanley Ho with Clementina Leitão, the first woman, who intended to be also named as one of the asset administrators.
However, Hong Kong courts eventually refused Angela Ho's intention, justifying that management by the company KPMG, and suggested by Pansy Ho, had the support of most Stanley's assets.
Control in 1970
As for the sale, it is in charge of the CBRE real estate agency, and will take place privately, without the terrain, currently without construction, will be the subject of any intervention. The location is regarded as attractive, as it is close to the B2 exit from the Tsim Sha Tsui Metro Station, an area with various trade, entertainment and meal options, as well as attracting several residents of Hong Kong and tourists.
According to information from the HK01 portal, the land that will now be sold was initially controlled by Stanley in partnership with Rogério Lobo, businessman and former Hong Kong deputy, born in Macao.
However, in 1970, Ho bought all the property for 82,500 dollars from Hong Kong. More recently, in March 2023, the land was delivered to KPMG to deal with the sale.</description><pubDate>2025-03-13 01:26:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and whether in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would and were amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”).

O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

Helahoho! Helahoho!
The sewing machine of the poor widow killed to the bayonet…
She sews in the afternoon indeterminate ...

What is clear today, at this disastrous moment when Cristiano &amp; Company failed in their mission in Braga, and where the self-sabotage of Russia pipelines recalls that Putin will even be willing to maintain dominion over referendum zones,
It is that, pump per bomb, the “bomb” of the fifth empire was preferable.

According to data from the scholarship market compiled by the news agency, global funds have reduced their positions in the last 12 sessions on the island's scholarship market, disintelating in the net value of 391 billion Taiwanese dollars since Wednesday.
TSMC, which represents more than a third of the weight of the Taiwanese scholarship market reference index, fell almost 10 percent during this period, as foreign investors sold 155 million actions, according to Bloomberg.
The Taiwan scholarship market was dragged by the global fall of semiconductor manufacturers' actions this year, due to concerns about the high appreciation of the sector and the appearance of DeepSek, one of China's most advanced artificial intelligence applications, Bloomberg explained.
TSMC, which recorded revenues equivalent to 15,500 million euros in the first two months of the year, 39.2 percent than in the same period of 2024, down 0.4 percent at the same time, after closed 1.75 percent the day before.
Headquarters of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer (TSMC) and the world's largest technology automaker (Foxconn), Taiwan has benefited strongly from the growth of artificial intelligence and high performance computing, thanks to the good relationship between island companies and sector leaders such as Nvidia and AMD.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 02:32:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Teaching / AI | Courses in Beijing's primary and secondary schools later this year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/14/ensino-ia-cursos-nas-escolas-primarias-e-secundarias-de-pequim-ainda-este-ano/</link><description>Since the second half of 2025, all Beijing primary and secondary schools will offer general artificial intelligence courses (AI) with a workload of at least 8 hours a year, according to the Plan for Promotion of Artificial Intelligence Education in Primary and Secondary Schools (2025-2027), recently released by the Municipal Beijing Education Commission, the People's Diary indicates.
The curriculum will cover all stages of education, from elementary school to high school, and aims to strengthen students' abilities in this key area. Schools will have the flexibility to create AI autonomous courses or combine them with other subjects, such as information technology, science, practical activities and work education, adds the publication.
In addition, within the program, the Chinese capital plans to train one hundred recognized specialized teachers and a thousand prominent specialized teachers in AI education.
The initiative is part of Beijing's broader effort to accelerate the construction of an IA educational system with characteristics of the capital and, at the same time, promote the reform and development of basic education. Focusing on six key areas of AI application, including teaching, learning, promotion, evaluation, research and administration, the city will explore new AI application scenarios.
This ambitious plan puts Beijing as a pioneer in the integration of AI in education, to prepare students to navigate the digital world while using technology responsibly.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 02:31:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Oman's Gulf | China, Russia and will complete exercises</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/14/golfo-de-oma-china-russia-e-irao-completam-exercicios/</link><description>The Marinhas of the Three Nations carried out simulations of salvage of kidnapped vessels to reinforce the fighting capacity against maritime terrorism and piracy
 
China, Iran and Russia yesterday concluded a series of maritime exercises in the context of joint maneuvers near the Iranian Port of Chabahar in Oman's Gulf. According to the Chinese official press, the three sea simulated hijacked commercial ships rescue operations, with the aim of "strengthening the naval capacities of the three countries to cope with security threats."
The operation took place in a region near Chabahar Port and included attacks on maritime targets, approach and damage control, as well as joint search and rescue operations.
According to Chinese state television CCTV, the exercises included heavy machine gun shots at maritime targets, targeting nighttime training and hijacked simulated commercial vessels.
Quoted by Global Times official newspaper Zhang Junshe, an expert on Chinese military affairs, said the exercise focused on the fight against maritime terrorism and piracy. The exercises, nicknamed “Security Ties 2025”, aim to “deepen mutual military trust and pragmatic cooperation between the Armed Forces of participating countries,” the Chinese army said in a statement.
The story is repeated
The China Popular Liberation Army Navy (ELP) sent the Baotou Freemaker and the Gaoyouhu Supply Ship to participate in the exercises, detailed the same source.
The annual exercises were performed at a similar date in 2024, also in the waters of the Gulf of Oman, and involved Chinese forces with the Urumqi guided missile fidge, the Linyi missile frigate and the Dongotiasto Supply Ship.
Last year's exercise coincided with the Huthis rebels in Yemen against the Red Sea-parked US and British war ships to protect navigation on this strategic river way through which it is estimated to pass 15 percent from worldwide maritime trade.
This year's exercises coincide with a meeting in Beijing on Friday, between representatives from China, Russia and Iran on the Iranian nuclear question.</description><pubDate>2025-03-14 02:29:35</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Japan regrets imposition of tariffs on steel</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/13/eua-japao-lamenta-imposicao-de-tarifas-sobre-o-aco/</link><description>Japan lamented yesterday to be the target of 25 -per cent customs tariffs on steel, imposed by the United States, warning that customs barriers may have a considerable impact on economic connections.
Tokyo government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said it was “unfortunate” that Japan has not achieved exemption from steel and aluminum, in force since yesterday, marking a new stage in the United States and the main commercial partners.
In addition to Japan, European Union, Canada, China and Australia are affected by this measure, and the statement's declared goal, Donald Trump, is protecting US steel industry, which has seen production decrease from year to an increasingly strong competition from Asia (see page 11).
The United States imports about half of the steel and aluminum used in the country, for sectors as varied as the automotive and aeronautical industries, petrochemicals and basic consumption products, such as canned ones.
Hayashi also said that Japanese steel and aluminum do not compromise the national security of the United States and that Japanese products are of high quality, difficult to replace, reinforcing the competitiveness of the American transforming industry.
"Commercial restriction measures adopted by the United States will probably have a considerable impact on economic relations between Japan and the United States, as well as on the multilateral commercial system," the spokesman also warned, not to mention any reprisals.
Unlucky
Earlier this week, Japanese Minister Yoji Muto moved to Washington to try to get an exemption from the US administration, but without success. Japan exported 31.4 million tons of steel in 2024, including 1.12 million tons to the United States, according to data from the Japanese authorities.
This value corresponds to 4 percent of US steel imports, Tokyo being the sixth largest supplier, behind Canada, Brazil and Mexico. By 2022, Japan obtained exemption on export rights for the United States of 1.25 million tons of steel per year.
Donald Trump also threatens to aggravate rates on car imports from April. This is an important issue for Tokyo since last year the automotive industry represented about 28 percent of all Japanese exports to the United States.
During the first term, United States President Donald Trump had already imposed 25-per cent customs duties on steel and 10 percent over aluminum in an attempt to protect the American industry mainly from the US Center and West.</description><pubDate>2025-03-13 01:53:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Pakistan | China condemns train deviation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/13/paquistao-china-condena-desvio-de-comboio/</link><description>China yesterday condemned the deviation from the Jaffar Express train by the Baluchistan Rebel Rebel Group (BLA), which is responsible for several attacks against the Pakistani security forces and Chinese investments in the region.
“China firmly condemns this attack and opposes any kind of terrorism, regardless of its form. We will continue to support Pakistan in the fight against terrorism, as well as to maintain stability and protect civilians, ”said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning at a press conference.
The spokesman added that China is "ready to work on anti-terrorist operations with Pakistan to keep the region safe and stable."
More than 150 passengers were rescued in a complex safety operation in the Baluchistan Pakistani province, following the JAFFAR EXPRESS hijacking by BLA members, military sources said yesterday.
Security forces continue the operation to release the other hostages detained by BLA, which took over the train with more than 400 passengers on board when it was heading from Quetta to Peshawar.
BLA, which seeks the independence of Baluchistan, the largest province of Pakistan, has a long insurrection history, with attacks against the Pakistani security forces and Chinese investments in the region.</description><pubDate>2025-03-13 01:43:32</pubDate></item><item><title>China | Expected limited shock of steel and aluminum rates</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/13/china-esperado-choque-limitado-das-taxas-sobre-aco-e-aluminio/</link><description>China's Iron and Steel Association predicted a limited impact of the US 25 percent rates on steel and aluminum imports, but warned for the adverse effect for world industry.
In Chinese bags, nine of the ten largest Chinese steel companies yesterday registered losses, but in the case of aluminum, Chalco and China Hongqiao, the two main companies in this sector, gained 4.63 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively.
With regard to this measure imposed by US President Donald Trump, who came into force yesterday, the Chinese association provides for a "limited" impact, as China's steel exports to the US "represent a small percentage." However, "in the long run, it may take other countries to follow the example, reducing the competitiveness of steel exports in China."
Organization vice-secretary-general, Zhang Longqiang, told CCTV state station that the measure is “an act of commercial protection” and expressed “firm opposition” to new rates because “they are not conducting healthy and fair trade and market competition”.
“The increase in rates will not ultimately protect US steel industry - on the contrary. In addition, from a medium and long term perspective, the rates will have an adverse impact on the industrial chain and the world steel industry supply chain, including China's, ”he said.
The spokesman for commerce, he Yongqian, also stressed that "many countries have explicitly opposed." Beijing protested at the time against the 25 percent rates imposed by the US on steel and aluminum imports, stressing that there are no winners in commercial disputes.
Although the US is not among its leading buyers-it has imported about 1.8 percent of Asian steel purchases-China exports these materials to other countries such as Canada and Mexico, which in turn sell them to the US country.
Domino effect
According to experts, some products are purchased by other countries and resubmitted to the United States, which would affect Chinese semi -decaded steel, which is transformed into countries such as Mexico or Vietname before being exported to the United States.
Experts also foresee a domino effect as rates will increase steel and aluminum prices, especially in the US, which will lead to widespread increases worldwide.
Other consultants suggest that the measures are intended to prevent the evasion of rates through the transhipment of steel and aluminum through third countries, in what is known as “triangular” trade.
On Monday, new Chinese rates on US agricultural products in response to Washington previously imposed rates on Chinese products.</description><pubDate>2025-03-13 01:42:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Former Filipino President detained boarded a plane to The Hague, confirms a lawyer</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/ex-presidente-filipino-detido-embarcou-num-aviao-para-haia-confirma-advogado/</link><description>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, detained under a warrant of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged crimes against humanity, embarked on Tuesday on a plane to Hague, his lawyer said.
Duterte boarded Manila International Airport with three others around 9:00 pm, Martin Delgra told reporters, according to the French agency AFP. “We cannot approach the plane. The plane is still on the track with the door open, ”he added at the time.
It is unknown whether the plane has already taken off from Manila to Hague, headquarters of the TPI, in the Netherlands. The Supreme Court of the Philippines had announced hours before it would examine a petition presented by Duterte's lawyer to suspend the arrest of the former president.
Duterte, 79, was arrested today by the Philippine Police upon arriving Manila from Hong Kong under a TPI term, who accused him of crimes against humanity. The alleged crimes will have been committed during the Duterte Administration Anti-Drug War (2016-2022), which victimized about 6,000 people, police said.
Several non-governmental organizations state that the number of victims will be 30,000 killed in anti-drug operations and extrajudicial executions.
The UN Human Rights Office concluded, in a report published in 2020, that there was evidence of generalized and systematic human rights violations, such as extrajudicial executions and arbitrary arrests.
Following Duterte's detention, families from victims of extrajudicial executions during the Anti -Drug War participated in a Thazon City Thanks Mass in the Manila Metropolitan Region.
"This is a Thanksgiving Mass for a huge surprise, a historic surprise, Duterte was arrested and his arrest warrant was fulfilled," Father Bong Sarabia told journalists, quoted by Filipina PNA. “It is possible that the case in the international criminal court proceed now. This is the year of Jubilee, Freedom and Justice, especially for families who survived, ”he added.
Some of the family members said Duterte's detention does not replace pain with those who were killed. “At least, [Duterte] was only arrested. Our loved ones were killed at the scene, ”said Amy Jane Lee, whose husband, Michael, was killed in a drug -related shooting in 2017.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 04:19:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | China expects “just and lasting solution” for the war</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/12/ucrania-china-espera-solucao-justa-e-duradoura-para-a-guerra/</link><description>China said yesterday expects to be found a “fair and lasting solution” for the war between Ukraine and Russia, before negotiations between US and Ukrainian authorities in Saudi Arabia.

"China supports all efforts that contribute to a peaceful resolution of the crisis," the spokesman continued when asked about the conversations. "China is also ready to continue to work with the international community to play a constructive role in the political resolution of the crisis," he added.
Beijing presents itself as a neutral part in the war, claiming not to send lethal help to either side, unlike the United States and other Western countries. But China is a political and economic ally of Russia and NATO members have described the Asian country as a “decisive facilitator” of the war, which has never condemned.

"This morning, the Manila Interpol received the official copy of a warrant of capture issued by the TPI [International Criminal Court]," said the presidential presidency in a statement. "It is currently found in custody," he said.
Rodrigo Duterte (2016-2022) was arrested after arriving from Hong Kong and police took him in custody by order of the ICC, which has been investigating the mass murders that occurred during the former leader's repressive campaign against the drug, said President Ferdinand Marcos's office in a statement.
The ICC launched an investigation into murders related to the anti -drug campaign under the command of Duterte, between November 1, 2011, while still mayor of the city of Davao, in the south of the country, and March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity.
Duterte removed the Philippines in 2019 of the Statute of Rome, as the human rights activists say that it aimed to escape accountability for murders.
Duterte's government moved to suspend the investigation of this court in late 2021, arguing that the Philippine authorities were already investigating the same allegations and saying that the TPI - a court of last appeal - had no jurisdiction. TPI judges decided in July 2023 that the investigation could be resumed and rejected the Duterte government's objections.
Crucial intermediary
Headquartered in The Hague in the Netherlands, ICC can intervene when countries do not want or cannot prosecute suspects of the most serious international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and humanity crimes.
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and was involved in a bitter political dispute with the former president, decided not to join this Universal Court again.
However, Marcos's administration said he would cooperate if ICC asked to the International Police to bring Duterte under custody through the so -called “red alert”, a request for law enforcement agencies around the world to locate and temporarily stop a crime suspect.</description><pubDate>2025-03-12 04:05:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Augusto Nogueira, President of Artm: “Macau is ahead of Hong Kong”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/augusto-nogueira-presidente-da-artm-macau-esta-a-frente-de-hong-kong/</link><description>The Macao toxicode dependent rehabilitation association is 25 years old this year. Augusto Nogueira makes a positive balance of the fourth century that began with a small therapeutic community and reached international recognition. The Association's president argues that, in prevention, Macau is at the head of Hong Kong and that the use of synthetic drugs is not yet problematic in the territory
 
 
What balance does the work developed by ArtM in these 25 years?
We do the balance very positive, because we started with a small area and a small therapeutic community. Nowadays we have a community with a capacity of 60 people, much more than the 15 we had at the time. We have developed several programs, namely the syringe distribution, which is a success, because it has led to a reduction and almost suppression of HIV contagion by people who inject drugs. For nine years there is the program and we have zero cases of infection. We developed support for social integration and follow -up after treatment, with “After Care”. We do preventive work in schools with the “Be Cool” program. We have the project “Hold on To Hope”, betting on vocational education, through coffee and the art gallery. It is a project that is well achieved and that turns out to be turned to tourism. We have visits from international entities and various non-governmental organizations, and the United Nations themselves. The most positive for us is to know how many people are recovered and who are well today. Unfortunately, we could not recover all people, but in each relapse there is always the possibility of the person coming again to do treatment.
How many people have recovered in 25 years?
We couldn't get this notion. We maintain contact with many people, but others have already left Macau, followed their lives. We have some contacts in the first two years after treatment, but then life goes on. People also want to go on a lifetime with no connection with the artm, sometimes marry and new companions don't know about their previous life and want to keep some confidentiality. But sometimes we meet. The other day they paid me a water without me knowing (laughs). These are small gestures that give us satisfaction to continue and make us believe that recovery is always possible.
What are the big challenges to maintain the ArtM project in terms of space and financing?
In terms of space and places for treatment we are well. The facilities are ten years old, there are maintenance problems, but this is more related to the panorama of construction in Macao. We need a space for the After Care, because what we have currently rented and is deteriorated. We are talking to the Institute of Social Action (IAS) to have a new space. With regard to the back, all our departments have financing, but we obviously seek support for our activities otherwise.
Regarding the authorities' posture regarding consumption and treatment, do you understand that it is still conservative in relation to other countries and regions?
This question is a little ambiguous. In terms of treatment and strategy in combating consumption, I think Macau is very ahead of Hong Kong, for example. In Macao, we have therapeutic community, we work on prevention and treatment, as well as our syringes and methadone distribution program. We have a range of treatments available to those in need. In the area of ​​prevention, the government has given a lot of support. The IAS has been quite open in strategies to combat consumption and prevention. In Hong Kong, for example, there is no syringe distribution program. Macao is from the few regions of Southeast Asia that has a government -supported syringes distribution program. But there could be another different interpretation of the law, with a differentiation between what is trafficking and their own consumption. For example, at this time if the person has a higher amount than that stipulated is soon considered trafficking, without proof. We think that in this case there should be a differentiation. It is then up to the police to investigate whether the quantities found are for consumption or trafficking. There should be an opening to give people more opportunities to be referred for treatment instead of going to prison. But lately, there have not been as many cases as that.
How do you describe the current consumer profile in Macau?
There is a large reduction in heroin consumption, and the few people who did so consume it today, or sleep. At this time the highest consumption is metabetamin, cannabis and some ketamine residues. As for the new synthetic drugs, there have been some records, but so far nothing alarming. But of course we have to be alert, we have to continue to do a good prevention job so that people are aware of the problems related to drug use. Regarding trafficking, we know that before the pandemic there was much cocaine trafficking to Macao, and after Covid-19 this situation almost ceased to happen. A good dissuasive work has been done and has to continue to be done so that there is less traffic to pass through Macau. It does not mean that there are no situations currently, but we are not in such a chaotic situation as that.
Speaking of synthetic drugs and their consumption, which according to the latest United Nations report has reached a worrying situation around the world. What is your comment to the scenario described in the annual report of the International Narcotics Control Board?
It is evident that the use of this type of drugs has been increasing over the years. Synthetic drugs are a real problem in the United States of America, for example, with fentanyl consumption, and Asia in some countries. It is a global problem because consumption and production are easy. Some of these drugs are made with other chemicals and many other products that are not well known to the origin and that can cause many overdoses. The UN suggests combating the production of ingredients that are used to produce these drugs, continue to reinforce the investigation to catch traffickers. But there are points of this report that it is necessary to follow, for many countries, which is the struggle between ideologies.
In what sense?
There is a struggle between those who argue that harm reduction is sufficient to combat all these problems that are arising, and that it is the solution to everything. Then we have those who think that harm reduction is not missing. In the artm we consider that there has to be a balance, because prevention is something important that cannot stop. What happened in Portugal, for example, when they liberalized the drug and failed to prevent and support treatment, [it was not good], and today Portugal is again in a slightly chaotic situation at consumption and trafficking. This means that prevention can never cease to exist. There should be quality treatments, with supervision of entities. The speed of access to treatment has to exist, and it can not be like in some countries where people have been waiting for a vacancy or permission to enter, as non -governmental organizations do not let the person enter until they receive the subsidy for each bed and patient. In these months a lot can happen. Damage reduction should be seen as a continuity for recovery, with rooms for consumption with medical and technical support, or syringe management programs. There is another problem, especially in Europe, which is heroin consumers, when they reach a more advanced age, already have many health problems and need sites to be, of a certain dignity. We have been wasting a lot of time with these ideological wars, and some of them exist for the sake of power, to influence the liberalization of drugs, and this is quite harmful. People's rights end when it begins to harm the rights of all other people, there must be a balance. As the report also says, there is a lack of medicines for some countries in Africa.

Art
To commemorate the 25th anniversary, the artm inaugurated on Friday the “Exhibition of the 25th Anniversary of Artm”, which is evident in the Hold on To Hope Gallery until the 23rd of this month. In the cultural space in the village of Nossa Senhora in Ká-Hó, which is part of the Occupational Therapy Program for the Arts users, you can see an art show done by these, with 45 works of ceramic, painting and wooden works. According to a press release of the association, the exhibition “celebrates resilience, creativity and healing”. “Throughout the last quarter of the century, the artm has been a symbol of hope for individuals on their journey of dependence recovery.

The official defends speed in investigations of cases of domestic violence and more days of maternity leave
 
 
Regarding domestic violence, the law remains not revised, with many cases where it cannot be accused or condemned the aggressor. What needs to be changed in current legislation?
You should accelerate the time spent in investigating the case, as well as to make a simple promotion of the law, to let people understand what they will face if they report the situation to the police. There is still afraid of the complaint to the police, so what happens is that the aggressor, before a complaint, gets angry, again committing violence and the family is departed.
How many women are currently at the center of the good shepherd?
According to the License of Service granted by the Institute of Social Action (IAS), we can welcome 14 people, including children. We currently have 11 people, six women, three children and two girls living in our center. Some of these women have problems due to emotional conflicts, and although they already have some stability at this level, they continue to have financial difficulties. Many of these women are not permanent residents, so they are unable to apply for government social housing, and they need more time to save money to pay an income in Macao, which is not cheap. If young children exist, it is harder for them to find a full -time job, so these women cannot move in a short time for a home, staying in our center a year. And in this situation, the center cannot have more empty rooms to help other women in crisis.
Do you consider that more reception centers are needed for victims of violence in Macao, or more resources to ensure the victim's safety, since the territory is so small?
I think the resources are sufficient, but the investigation process is time consuming. Victims need more protection, as there is always the risk that the perpetrator continues to threaten them.
What is necessary to increase the birth rate and ensure that women continue to have access to equal economic and employment opportunities?
Promotion needs to be continuous, and should increase maternity leave, as in other countries there are more maternity leave. The monthly value of day care centers could also be decreased. The attribution of a subsidy by each child could also be considered if the family has financial problems.
There is a lack of support for single -padded families, where women are alone with dependent children, or where women are caregivers? In concrete terms, what needs to be improved?
I think yes. I think some of them do not know that there are resources in society to help them, or may not have motivation to seek help. Many of these women also do not want to rely on government, not even non -governmental associations or organizations that provide services to the family. But these women can always apply for the subsidy attributed by the Institute of Social Action, which gives them some money and allows you to stay at home to take care of their children.
How do you describe women in Macao currently, especially the Chinese community? Are you more emancipated and equal to men regarding their rights?
Nowadays the capacity of women has changed a lot, as they have equal opportunities and the right to develop. Many local companies are already chaired by women, for example. In addition to having physical strength, they can choose their jobs, attend higher education, marry and have the ability to take leadership positions. However, there are many women who come to Macau and marry residents and have a lower social position, suffering from various family problems. I speak of machismo that still exists, the addiction of the game, situations of toxicodependence or lack of communication. There are men who control everything, creating a climate in which the wife has to hear her husband and is devoid of self-esteem to get out of this situation. In such cases, it is very easy to have discussions, conflicts and even cases of violence between the couple. These are situations that obviously also affect their children.
International Women's Day celebrated in Macau
International Women's Day was celebrated in Macao in very diverse ways. In the case of Sands China, flowers were offered to the operator's workers as a way of expressing “the appreciation for the indispensable contributions that women make in the workplace, in the family and society”, can read in a company statement. It was also organized a debate that focused on the issues around women, organized by the Sands Empowher volunteer team, a “global initiative of diversity and inclusion led by women, which aims to connect the team's female members to create network job opportunities”. This event was broadcast live on Sands China's various digital platforms.
Sands Empowher is, above all, to organize training and mentoring actions so that women can develop in professional and career terms.
In the same note, it states that the company “is committed to building and maintaining a workplace with respect and equality”, defending and guaranteeing women's rights. Regarding sexual harassment, Sands states that it has carried out a campaign to prevent cases since July 2018, as well as actions that reduce cases of discrimination against women.
This was “the first in Macao”, and a “training action with all team members” on these themes was also carried out. Regarding support for maternity, "the company also offers breastfeeding rooms for mothers and performs a wide variety of activities for parents and children to promote family harmony."
At the Portuguese School of Macao, International Women's Day was celebrated on Friday with the DAC project-“Women who inspire”, an initiative organized by the teachers of the disciplines of Portuguese, Philosophy and Mathematics, among others. The 10th grade students have developed several works on inspiring women in the most diverse areas. One of them was the recently deceased poet Maria Teresa Horta.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 03:54:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Bernardo Mendia, Chamber of Commerce and Industry Portugal - Hong Kong: “Portugal should extend your hand”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/06/bernardo-mendia-camara-de-comercio-e-industria-portugal-hong-kong-portugal-deve-estender-a-mao/</link><description>The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry of Hong Kong, Sun Dong, arrives today, accompanied by entrepreneurs from digital areas, online trade and technology. Bernardo Mendia, Mayor of Commerce and Industry Portugal - Hong Kong, highlights the importance of visiting Portuguese companies and Raehk as a complement to Portuguese contacts in Macau
 
 
Last year, Portugal was visited by Christopher Hui Ching-Yu, Secretary of Hong Kong Financial Affairs and Treasury, and now another Hong Kong ruler passes through Portugal. Is it a visit with added meaning?
As a Chamber of Commerce and Industry Portugal - Hong Kong we consider this visit extremely important, valuing the attention that is being given to Portugal. It is important, above all, because it is such a specific area as innovation. This is an area where Hong Kong bets a lot and has been a priority for the region's authorities, and this is something that exists in common with Portugal, which has also bet on technological and scientific development. What Portugal should do is take this opportunity, extend your hand to the secretary and work in partnership. Technological and economic development is only done with international partnerships, opening markets and collaborations. This is also what we promote as a Chamber of Commerce. We have been involved in organizing this trip, something that started months ago. We will lead Portuguese companies to identify potential synergies with the entities that come here, so that they know each other and then do their work.
Hong Kong has been present in all editions of Websummit in Lisbon. Does this visit give the idea that the region intends to expand and establish more concrete partnerships with Portugal?
Yes, no doubt. This has evidenced in official speeches of the most important members of the Hong Kong government, including the executive's own head. This is the region's strategy at this time, being a bridge for the rest of the world to be able to enter Asia. Then the territory competes with other platforms, as Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo are perhaps the three territories with the greatest expression in this [technological] area in Asia. But Hong Kong presents the best conditions, not only for the support it gives [to companies], but also for being part of China, despite having a different legal system and a different currency. There is a system completely open at the level of capital circulation and internet access. I think Hong Kong is better positioned in this field, but this is a competition that the territory has to do, such as Portugal when it will perform in Asia, competing with Spain and other European countries in attracting foreign direct investment.
Macao is usually the main connection to Portugal, for historical reasons and the presence of the Portuguese language. Can Hong Kong also be a binding territory between Portuguese companies and Asia?
Macau and Hong Kong are very complementary in this regard. Macao has this historical connection with Portugal and has very important companies based in the territory, some of them for over 100 years, namely the National Bank Overseas. This experience, and the fact that the Portuguese language is still official, is undoubtedly an advantage for Portuguese companies. If it is necessary to enter the capital market, Portuguese companies will opt for a number of services provided by Hong Kong. But Macau has its own advantages and I consider it two very complementary markets. The geographical proximity of Macau and Hong Kong also acts as an attractive point.
During Christopher Hui Ching-Yu's visit last year, Hong Kong's position as Fiscal Paradise was addressed. How do you look at this question?
This visit is organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office and the tax issues will now be set aside. But our position, as a Chamber of Commerce, is that it makes no sense Hong Kong being on the list of tax havens, and makes no sense or from a legal point of view. None of the markets we compete with Hong Kong as a fiscal paradise, nor the European Union itself. We just have to lose with it, because we create barriers to trade and foreign direct investment in Portugal, and also the investment that is made by Portuguese companies in Macao, which are eventually affected by it. It makes no sense to this designation from a legal point of view, because Hong Kong does not gather the conditions to be part of the list of tax havens, and from the political point of view because no other European country puts the territory in this category.
China is present in the Portuguese market through various investments. Hong Kong is trying to create its own way?
Not in these terms. The overwhelming majority of Chinese investment that is made in Portugal is through Hong Kong. Then, in this respect, Hong Kong and China work in a quite complementary way. Hong Kong acts as a "aircraft carrier" from China in terms of foreign investment, and there is no competition between the two, working, together.
Encounters in Oeiras | Taguspark today hosts exchange sessions and seminars
Dong Sun is accompanied by Portugal by Hong Kong's most important companies and entities in the areas of innovation, technology and digital media, either government, with Hong Kong Science and Technology Park and “Cyberport”, technology park with budget projects in two billion Hong Kong; either academic and research, attending the entourage of the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute and “Hong Kong Microelectronics Research and Development Institute”.
Exchange sessions and seminars take place today from 4 pm at Taguspark, Oeiras, where Oeiras Valley Investment Agency is located, whose representatives have already been present in Macao for commercial contacts.
In the afternoon there will be the opportunity for dialogue between the Secretary of Hong Kong, representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Portugal - Hong Kong and leaders of Raehk's technological parks and institutes, and in total 24 companies are represented.
In the Catalan road
In a statement issued by the Hong Kong executive, it is read that the program includes “meetings and exchanges with leaders of local political, business and innovation and technology sectors”, as well as visits to infrastructure, technological parks, research institutes and businesses.
The aim is to “reinforce ties and cooperation” with Portugal in this sector, “promoting the advantages of Hong Kong innovation and technology and exploring business opportunities abroad,” according to the statement.
Before passing through Lisbon, the delegation was in Barcelona to participate in the “Mobile World Congress”, considered one of the most influential technological events worldwide.
This is the second visit to Portugal of a member of the Hong Kong government within a year, after the secretary for financial services and treasure had passed through Lisbon in June. At the time, Christopher Hui Clay-Yu asked Portugal to remove Hong Kong from the list of tax havens and argued that it already fulfills the European Union standards to combat tax dropout.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Cristina Rocha Leiria, author of the project of the Ecumenical Center Kun Aím: “The work that most filled me”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/cristina-rocha-leiria-autora-do-projecto-do-centro-ecumenico-kun-iam-a-obra-que-mais-me-preencheu/</link><description>Until March 13 can be seen at the Kun Iam Ecumenical Center, the show “Moments of Light With Kun Iam”, an exhibition by Cristina Rocha Leiria, architect, sculptor and author of the center project.

Tell me “moment of light”, the exhibition patent at the Kun Iam ecumenical center.
The center was created for silence, because everything is done for majorities, but we have to think about minorities, which have the right to exist. There may be a minority that needs silence. Crystals are seen from Portugal and also purchased in China, chosen by me, and energy stones. There are also 25 pieces made by Atlantis [Portuguese Company of the Vista Alegre Group] in Cristal, as well as a bazaar with other materials.
The ecumenical center was inaugurated in 1999, 25 years passed. How do you look at the project today? Do you feel that you are properly used?
It is the work that filled me the most. I worked on it at the level of architecture, because this is my training area, and I also worked with the sculpture because it is what I do, although I did not take any course. I sculpture as therapy. I worked at the level of music with Kyao and another conductor, who realized what I wanted and made a composition of such order that plays all day [in the center] and people never get tired. I treated, at the time, everything else, the decoration and what was sold there. Things have been running out and there was almost nothing to sell except for some books and postcards. We created a lot that sold, the tourists went there, made no noise because they realized it was a place of silence, bought and this space had a certain performance. This ecumenical center should be disclosed, which has become a former Macao Libris, with tourists as Macau has and that exists in any other urban place in the world. Therefore, the center works at this time with an exhibition of mine and a bazaar that has products that sell themselves in other places and that have nothing to do with the ecumenical center, but are a gimmick.
How was the start of the construction of this project? Have you ever done anything so much with so much connection with the spirit world?
I lived in Mozambique until I went to Lisbon to study architecture. As a child I know the goddess Kun Age, because my mother had a white statue of Kun ran home, and it was the thing I liked the most in that house. Little did I know that one day I would make a center dedicated to this goddess. When I came to Macau to work in the Leal Senate, as the president's advisor, with the first money I earned I went to Hong Kong to buy a white Abat-Jour with the figure of Kun Iam, which I still have today. Regarding the spiritual part, it comes from a child, I always liked the silence. When I do architecture or sculpture it is always in complete silence. I am only me linked to work and a world that, as it is not tangible, many people do not even realize it, do not believe him. I believe because I feel that when I work two nightsless nights, or three days in a row, in any project, silent, I wake up in the morning and I think of the ideas I had, I am surprised even with them. So the spiritual part is reflected in the sculpture I make. I specialize in housing and spirituality is also reflected in the projects I did in Macao in the area of ​​social housing. Spirituality is a part of me, and the ecumenical center is guided to it. In these guided tours that I have tried to pull for younger people to realize that we can be greatly helped by energies that we do not see. I do not name things and say not to care about it, because the important thing is to become aware that there is more than what we see. The material world is not the only one who interests us, there is more to make contact and thank.
Macao is a territory based on consumption, the game, the excesses. Having a center of this nature in this society has a greater meaning?
This center is ecumenical, but it has nothing to do with the church, referring to something comprehensive. The center was made for atheists, agnostic, religious and non -religious, for all those who need silence. And in the world of Macao, or in large urban media, there is always hearing pollution. This center was made on an island that I asked for the governor of the time, General Vasco Rocha Vieira, who was a very open person to this proposal. This island was created because there was no space in Macau at the time to place a 20 meter high monument. The center became a symbol, many will pray there, but it was not done for it. I must say that I believe that the essence of the divine is in each of us, but not everyone is aware of it. Others are open to this essence.
Returning to the exhibition. What can people learn from her?
I am now in Macao for a period of six months, but I have also dealt with various projects related to projects I have done in Portugal for many years and I have been trying to be recovered. The exhibition itself is there and is not an attractive. It is good to know that the reopening of the ecumenical center did not have the disclosure it should have. No one knows that the ecumenical center has been opened, and who appears there are the people who leave the children in the parks, watch the space, and go there with the children. It is interesting because the little ones go precisely to the energy points identified by me. People who are walking, come in, but will not be on purpose to see my exhibition. Then, as they see the gate that gives the river, they leave soon and the exhibition goes unnoticed.
But regrets that no more dissemination has been made.
It was not done, no. Now I am doing this job and spreading with friendly people. I am finishing an exhibition without, in fact, people have enjoyed when I have sculptures with messages. It takes about a month to sculpture, and I write, thinking, doing poetry, so I have a lot to convey to people about each sculpture. Many people say they get out of there richer. I will ask the exhibition to be prolonged beyond March 13th and it was good to happen, because there have been groups of people, including some that mark time with me and I will make the guided tour.
How did your connection come to Chinese culture?
This connection comes from childhood. Then I deepened this connection a lot because I had to study about the goddess Kun Iam. I had to see many figures of Kun were going to think how it would do one that was suspended there, outdoors subject to taps and strong winds, as well as high temperatures. The spiritual part was easier for me, because since childhood I am interested in oriental philosophies. This part of spirituality [in the construction of the ecumenical center] was easier for me, although it had many difficulties. I gave myself everything, books to the library, and even contributed financially to this center so that many young people could enjoy it.
He told me that some works he has built need recovery. Is this side of the artist ungrateful to see the projects to destroy themselves over time without preservation?
I don't regret anything, I try to understand. But I also try to defend the purposes that existed in the start of each project. I try to understand the way of being of the Chinese who lived so many years limited and with many prohibitions. I would like to understand why they put a bazaar at the exhibition to sell so many products. The same happens in Portugal: I have the work “Candle to the Wind” in Tavira, in a huge roundabout that had a lake, it was something I tried to do poeticly, but then I see that people despise. Now there is no water in space and herbs grow. I feel that there is a lack of respect for the artist.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 23:35:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP Macau | FIA confirms GT World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/gp-macau-fia-confirma-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>The World Council of the FIA ​​last Wednesday confirmed the expected, that the eighth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup will be held as part of the Macao's 72nd Grand Program, from November 13 to 16. However, there is a big news for this year's edition
 
The International Federation, which co-organizes this race in partnership with Sro Motorsports Group and the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), took the opportunity to announce a new qualification model for the race. In addition to the 30 -minute qualification session equal to the previous editions (Q1), a second qualification segment (Q2) was added, reserved for the top ten pilots of the first session.
The Q2 session will be held in Super Pole format, with each pilot to go to the track individually for a total of two qualification turns, and each pilot is also allowed to use a new tire set at this session. This novelty will allow qualification to be decided without interference from third parties.
The remaining program of the Queen of GT will remain the same as the previous editions, with the free training session, the traditional 12-lap classification race on Saturday afternoon, followed by the 16-lap main race that will decide the world's Cup winner on Sunday.
Veterans compliments
These measures introduced by the FIA ​​were very well received by the most experienced GT riders. This is because traffic has always been a huge obstacle in obtaining a good qualification return on the guide circuit, something essential for those who aim to win this title.
"It's an excellent idea to introduce the Super Pole session in Macao," said German Maro Engel, the winner of the World Cup last edition by Mercedes-AMG. This will be one of the most spectacular and exciting sessions of the season and should also secure sports justice. Fans have a lot to yearn. ”
Raffaele Marciello, for two winning occasions of this trophy, and one of BMW's factory riders, also reacted positively, adding: “In Macao, it was always complicated to make a clean turn. With this new format, you will not hear the excuse of traffic or a red flag. Having only two laps will be very challenging, but now the fastest pilot will probably be in pole. ”
This is an opinion shared by Laurens Vanthoor, the World Cup winner in 2016, who said there will no longer be “apologies” in the qualification. Porsche's experienced Belgian pilot believes that “there will be an added pressure because you only have these two turns”, because in a difficult circuit like this, “if you make an error, there is nothing else to follow. In a normal qualification, you have more opportunities. Personally, a shootout is always something I appreciate a lot. For pilots, on a track like this, it will be almost the highlight of the weekend. ”
And the younger ones too
Chinese pilot Yifei Ye premiered at the Grand Prix last November at the World Cup. Ferrari's official pilot, which competes in the Endurance Fia World Championship (WEC), has left a good impression on the guide circuit, and he also welcomes the now introduced measurements.
“It's good to eliminate these red flag interventions and yellow flags, so that in the end, the one that really is the fastest to get pole position,” said Yifei Ye that she could return to the race this year. “In Macau, everyone is very close in terms of times, so it will be extremely difficult for pilots to try to reach Super Pole. I think it will also be great for viewers. ”</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 01:03:51</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Célio Alves Dias will continue to run this season</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/gp-celio-alves-dias-vai-continuar-a-correr-esta-temporada/</link><description>Macaense pilot Célio Alves Dias was one of the long -term returns of the 2024 car.
 
The Macao Cup winner of Macau in 2021 was removed from motorsport at the time of 2023 for personal reasons, but last year made his debut in the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8). Despite the vast experience in tests of the specialty, having conducted several generations of tourism cars, Célio Alves Dias had never managed the new bobbinns that the Macao-China General Association (AAMC) introduced in its competition in 2023. Last time turned out to be of learning, with some difficulties in the tuning and behavior of the Japanese car.
Participation in races at the Zhuzhou International Circuit and the Macau Grand Prix made Célio Alves Dias realize that his Toyota GR86 was not at the strongest competition level. Based on the conclusions drawn from these experiences, he decided to start preparing for the new season.
“The car had to be all dismantled. My car was bought on Monday, and the chassis and the security arc, for me, were not well done, ”explained Fu Lei Racing Team pilot to HM. “This, made the car too hard and very difficult to bow. I tried a car from China, which was well assembled, and there is a difference. I had a long time in January, in China, with this car. Our cars, made in the same workshop, were very hard, which made it difficult to make turns fast. ”
If in the Macao Grand Prix, the house riders, excellent guide circuit, managed to equate the progress to their hong Kong opponents and the interior of China, in the initial races on the Zhuzhou track in Hunan province, it wasn't quite like that. “There are many differences between cars, but especially in chassis, because engines, in terms of power and horses, are almost all at the same level. Our opponents also experienced many pieces, many engines, even gearboxes, and chassis. Competition cars are always the same. You have to have engine power, but also chassis. Having only power is not enough. Having better a good chassis is the most important. ”
Silver Jubilee in November
Being a usual Portuguese name in the Macao Grand Prix in recent decades, Célio Alves Dias debuted at the Guide Circuit in 2000 and from then was a frequent presence and no faults in the race until 2023. This year, its objective is to account for its twenty-fifth participation in the biggest sports event of RAEM, but will have to align in the findings.
While awaiting the announcement of the 2025 calendar by AAMC, Célio Alves Dias details details to start his test program, because his Toyota, after being reviewed, "is ready to test" in the interior of China, something that will happen "very soon," says the pilot.
In the last edition of the Grand Prix, Célio Alves Dias qualified in 12th place for the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. However, his participation was short and unhappy: at the wheel of Toyota with dorsal No. 11, was forced to give up after being immobilized on the climb of San Francisco. The Macanese pilot was out of the race on the first lap, in an incident that caused the Safety Car.</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:50:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Iame Asia finals of Karting back in December</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/finais-da-iame-asia-de-karting-voltam-em-dezembro/</link><description>The Macao Karting International Award will receive again, from December 11 to 14, the Iame Asian finals.

After welcoming TCR China by 2024, the FIA ​​TCR World Tour “worldwide” will have the company of the Australian competitors in the most demanding race of the season, as HM had already foreseen at the end of last year.
This announcement is the second news in the calendar of one of the largest national TCR competitions in the world, after the announcement of a new promoter for the championship.
One pilot who was certainly pleased with the news was Australian Ben Bargwanna, who ran on the streets of Macao in 2023. TCR Australia's first international participation was made possible by the global rights holder, the WSC Group, which will ensure full transportation costs for Australian teams traveling to Macau.
"TCR Australia has always been one of TCR's most important and exciting competitions, rooted in the long tradition of tourism motorsport in the country," said WSC Group president Marcello Lotti.
