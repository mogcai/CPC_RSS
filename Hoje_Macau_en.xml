The Macao International Airport Management Company admitted on Thursday that it could fail the passenger and load goals set to 2025, due to the "geopolitical situation and world economic instability."
CAM-Macao International Airport Society revealed that about 1.83 million passengers went through the infrastructure in the first three months of the year, more than in the same period of 2024. In a statement, the company stressed that the airport sued about 14,000 passenger flights, 1.6 percent more than January and March last year.
On the contrary, the load volume that underwent the infrastructure, located in the mud, fell 9.5 percent in the first quarter, in annual terms. CAM admitted that the airport had "not as good as expected. The geopolitical situation and world economic instability have imposed challenges to the development of routes."
"The increase in operating costs for airlines further restricted its capacity, leading to noticeable changes in market structure and having a significant impact on passenger and load operations," the company said. "It is expected that the volume of passengers and load in 2025 is not aligned with the goal scheduled at the beginning of the year," admitted Cam.
Objective of 113 thousand tons
In February, CAM president Simon Chan Weng Hong predicted to 2025 a movement over eight million passengers -which would be an increase of 8 percent -65,000 flight movements and a load volume of 113,000 tons.
On April 3, the Ethiopian Airlines company launched the first long -haul load route from Macao, bound for the Spanish capital, Madrid, with two round trip trips per week, thinking of transfronight electronic trade goods. In the statement on Friday, Cam revealed that the low-cost company Airasia will start charter flights to Tawau, Malaysia, early May.
In the same month, Macao is expected to have a new route to Jeju, in southern South Korea, operated by Jeju Air, Low Cost airline that also plans to start flying from Cheongju in the center of the country.
Macao airport currently has regular passenger flights operated by 27 airlines to 41 destinations in mainland China, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Japan and South Korea, according to the Cam portal.
In January, the company promised, together with the government, “explore more international markets with foreign and local airlines, to promote (…) the development of routes by 2025”.
In June 2023, the director of tourism services, Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, described the release of direct flights between Macau and Portugal as “a dream”, but also recalled that it was possible to work with neighboring Hong Kong, Cantão and Shenzhen airports.
Cam has revealed that the low -cost company Airasia will start 'charter' flights to Tawau, Malaysia in early May.</description><pubDate>2025-04-28 00:39:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism | Scheduled Rising of Visitors</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/28/turismo-prevista-subida-de-numero-de-visitantes/</link><description>The director of tourism services admits that the scenario may change, and that the government is prepared for it, but for now, keeps confidence in the growth of the tourism market of at least 4.1% N during the holidays of Labor Day
 
Macau's Director of Tourism Services (STD), Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, predicted on Friday a climb of at least 4.1 percent on the number of visitors during the holidays of Labor Day. Senna Fernandes said she expects a daily average of between 127,000 and 140,000 tourists between May 1 and 5, a period of holidays in the countryside, known as the “Golden Week”.
To Portuguese -speaking journalists, the leader added that Macau could receive between 630,000 and 700,000 visitors during these five days, one of the high seasons for tourism in the territory.
The most conservative forecast would mean a 4.1 percent increase compared to the same “golden week” of 2024, while the most optimistic forecast would be a 15.7 percent rise.
On Thursday, the Macau International Airport Management Company admitted that it could fail the passenger and load goals set to 2025, due to the “geopolitical situation and world economic instability”.
But the STD director said that “it is still a little early” to lower expectations to the total number of visitors during the year, which had been set at 39 million.
This is because “really policies are changing every day (…) we don't have a global view yet what will happen, maybe in two weeks,” admitted Senna Fernandes. "We are very careful, we are observing what is happening worldwide," added the manager.
For whatever comes and comes
“We have to have optimism and do our work, but also prepare for what can happen,” said Senna Fernandes.
The STD director spoke after the opening ceremony of the 13th International Tourism Expo (Industry) of Macao. On April 10, Senna Fernandes said the region is aware of the potential impact on the trust of Chinese tourists from the United States imposed on imports from China.
On April 15, the new leader of the Macao government, Sam Hou Fai, admitted to fear a budget deficit in 2025, due to the deceleration in the game's recipes. The previous Chief Executive, Ho Iat Seng, had predicted game revenues of 240 billion patacas by 2025, or 20 billion per month.
But in the first three months of the year, Macao casinos registered total revenues of 57.7 billion patacas, below the Government's goal. “We have to have a feeling of risk,” warned Sam Hou Fai.</description><pubDate>2025-04-28 00:35:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Budget | Surplus of public accounts supersedes forecast</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/28/orcamento-excedente-das-contas-publicas-suplanta-previsao/</link><description>Although Sam has fai admitting the possibility of presenting a rectifying budget and defending the need for greater austerity, in the first three months the budgetary surplus reached 9.25 billion PATACA
 
Macao ended March with an surplus in public accounts that is already higher than the government forecast for the entire year 2025, was on Friday announced. In the first three months, the surplus reached 9.25 billion patacas, 11.8 percent than in the same period of 2024, according to published online data by territory finance services.
Authorities had expected only 6.83 billion patacas for this year. Macao closed 2024 with an surplus of 15.8 billion patacas, more than twice the one recorded the previous year.
The year 2024 was the first since 2020, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, in which the territory was able to keep the accounts on positive ground, something required by the basic law, without transfers from the financial reserve.
Still, on April 15, government leader Sam Hou Fai admitted to fear a budget deficit in 2025, due to the slowdown in the game's recipes. Official data reveals a growth of 0.15 percent to 22.2 billion patacas, in tax revenues on the game until March, which still represented 88.4 percent of the total.
The six city game operators pay a 35 percent direct tax on the game's revenues, 2.4 percent for the Macao Social Security Fund and urban and tourist development and 1.6 percent delivered to the Macao Foundation for cultural, educational, scientific, academics and philanthropic.
The strength of the game
Until March, Macao casinos registered total revenues of nearly 57.7 billion patacas, more 0.6 percent than in the same period as 2024. Despite the growth in tax revenues, Macao current revenue fell 5.38 percent in the first three months of 2025, in annual terms, to 25.1 billion patacas.
The main reason for the decrease was financial revenues, which went from billion in the first quarter of 2024 to just two thousand patacas this year. This heading corresponds to the results of the Macao monetary authority, the region's financial regulator, including investment and interest and dividend revenues.
In the first three months, Macau collected 22.3 percent of the current revenue projected for 2025 in the budget, which is 112.6 billion patacas. The increased surplus of the territory was mainly due to public expense that descended 13.8 percent between January and March, to 15.9 billion patacas, especially due to a 21.4 percent cut in social support and subsidies given to the population.
The government spent 4.52 billion patacas under the Administration Investment and Expenses Plan (PIDDA), less 13.2 percent compared to the first three months of 2024.</description><pubDate>2025-04-28 00:30:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Aviation | Irritated Consul ”with wasted opportunities</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/28/aviacao-consul-irritado-com-oportunidades-desperdicadas/</link><description>Alexandre Leitão admits that he wrote to Portugal to complain about the lack of use of the moment to create an aerial connection of goods transport between Macao and Europe. The diplomat criticized the fact that the only direct air connection between Macao and Europe is not made through Portugal
 
Portugal's Consul General in Macao and Hong Kong, Alexandre Leitão, confessed to being “very angry” that the only direct connection of Macao to Europe was not made by Lisbon or Porto. The statements were made in a presentation of the Portugal Tourism Pavilion at the Macao International Tourism Fair.
“Days I wrote [a letter] to Lisbon, very annoyed, when Ethiopia Airlines opened [two weeks ago] its triangular load flight Adis Ababa-Madrid-Macau and with this created Macau's first direct connection to Europe,” said Alexandre Leitão, quoted by the Diário de Notícias (DN).
The Portugal representative at MSA and Raehk explained that for two years it was insisted with the authorities of Lisbon for the call to be secured by a Portuguese company, with a national airport, Porto or Lisbon, as a European platform.
“I have been insisting on this two years ago, so they do not convince me that it is not viable,” said Alexandre Leitão, remembering in Macau living 153 thousand Portuguese, inserted in a region that within 200 kilometers has two urban centers such as Shenzhen and the city of Canton, and Hong Kong.
"Here there are more than a hundred restaurants that complain Portuguese, there are dealers, there are commerce and this year will open two more Portuguese restaurants. I repeat, do not convince me that it is not feasible a flight that makes a dual function of transportation of people and transportation of goods," he said.
Sight of vision
Ethiopia Airlines flights will bring 20,000 tons of load per year “through a purely commercial flight”, between Adis Ababa, which is the African plate, Madrid the European plate and Macao.
"Explain me there why is Lisbon not an Atlantic and also European plaque, besides being Lusophone for markets like Brazil, which are served like no other? Or why African, Lusophone capitals, are not also instruments, distribution platforms of goods and services to other countries in Africa that want to come here?" "Anyway, I am not aviation technician, but until they explain to me for the most B that makes no sense at all, I will continue to insist on that. And I confess that the day the plane entered the airport, with the water jets, I was boring and wrote to Lisbon to sincerely expected this flight to consciously mean the relevant operators in Portugal, the government and the TAP."
Consul's appeal came to ensure that Portugal is positioned to take advantage of direct passenger transport between Macao and Europe. "All people interested in Portugal [look to] this potential before Ethiopia or other company anytime decides to make the flight of direct passengers to Madrid or Paris, wherever it is. So the task becomes more difficult. And this is the appeal I do to you," he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-04-28 00:27:33</pubDate></item><item><title>LAG 2025 | Facilitated automatic passage from foreign visitors</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/28/lag-2025-facilitada-passagem-automatica-de-visitantes-estrangeiros/</link><description>In the presentation of this year's security lines for security, Wong Sio Chak referred to the idea of ​​facilitating the entry into Macau to foreign visitors, with the creation of more automatic passage points
 
The Secretary for Security announced on Friday, plans to accelerate the border control of foreign visitors through the use of automatic electronic channels.
During the presentation of the Governing Action Lines Report (LAG) to 2025 in the area of ​​Security, Wong Sio Chak stated that the territory will extend the use of automatic passage points to foreign citizens without resident or work authorization.
To facilitate “exterior exchanges”, authorities will expand autoservice equipment to the biometric data collection system, which will apply to all foreign visitors, the leader explained.
To the deputies at the Legislative Assembly, the secretary added that the government will continue to optimize iris recognition technology in border controls and to study its extension to non-residents this year.
"We are also studying ways to widen the number of users eligible for automatic passage channels, allowing more foreign tourists to benefit from faster immigration processes and more fluid circulation in the large bay," Wong said.
Speech and company
In his speech, the secretary stated that "regarding the creation of a higher level of opening abroad, the input and output services will continue to be optimized and the facilitation measures of the border passage, to ensure a safe, effective, efficient and comfortable passage."
Thus, "with a view to promoting the exchange with the outside, the automatic passage channels will also have foreigners, so that they deal with the input and exit inspection formalities through these channels."
According to official data, Macau received, in 2024, 34.9 million visitors, 23.8 percent than the previous year, but only 2.42 million were international tourists. In October last year, the Chinese Foreign Ministry extended the Portuguese visa exemption policy, thus inserting Portugal into a list that already covered another 16 European countries.
The measure, which allows the Portuguese to stay in China for tourism, business or traffic for a maximum of 15 days, in force at least until December 31, 2025.
In the same month, Continental China had announced the expansion, from 90 to 180 days, from the permanence period for foreign residents of Macao on multiple entries in the country.
The measure includes permanent and non-permanent foreign residents of Macao that move “to the interior of China for short-term tourism, trade, visit to family members, visits and other activities”.
From July, the Chinese National Immigration Administration (NIA) had already allowed foreign permanent residents from Macao and Hong Kong to request authorization to enter the interior of China, valid for a maximum of five years. The measure covers members of the Portuguese community who are permanent residents in Macao and, until then, were required to ask for a visa to travel to the other side of the border.</description><pubDate>2025-04-28 00:26:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs | China decement Trump about commercial negotiations with the United States</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/28/tarifas-china-desmente-trump-sobre-negociacoes-comerciais-com-estados-unidos/</link><description>China has again denying it to be in negotiations with the United States about the tariffs, denying the comments of US President Donald Trump on Friday.

Pedro V | Carlos Paredes's birth celebration takes place tomorrow</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/25/teatro-d-pedro-v-celebracao-de-nascimento-de-carlos-paredes-acontece-amanha/</link><description>To celebrate the centenary of the birth of Carlos Paredes, one of the great names of the Portuguese guitar, happens tomorrow, at the D. Pedro V Theater, the “Concert of Tribute to Carlos Paredes”, with Paulo Soares, on the Portuguese guitar, and Rui Poço Ferreira, on viola. In an interview with HM, Paulo Soares unveiled the notes that will be heard tomorrow
 
This year the 100th anniversary of Carlos Paredes, named after the Portuguese guitar, and thinking about this is the House of Portugal in Macau (CPM) decided to mark the date with a concert that takes place tomorrow at the D. Pedro V Theater, from 20h00. On stage, there is Paulo Soares, guitarist, follower of the footsteps of the "walls", namely Carlos Paredes and his father, Artur, and Rui Poço Ferreira, on the accompaniment guitar.
Paulo Soares, who assumes herself as a “expert in all the music of the walls [Artur and Carlos Paredes], and not only”, teaches Portuguese guitar for 35 years and has been dedicated to studying the legacy of the Portuguese musician. But tomorrow's show will not just be based on the compositions of the walls.
“The show will be about the influence of the walls on the Portuguese guitar. Before Carlos Paredes we have the father, Artur Paredes, who was a revolutionary and virtuous guitarist in his time, with whom Carlos Paredes learned a lot. In fact, he always said that what he knew how to play had learned from his father. Carlos Paredes also had violin classes, and expanded what he learned from his father, in the way and the guitar.
This influence was found in many Portuguese guitarists, especially in the city of Coimbra, where there is also the musical genre Fado de Coimbra.
Thus, tomorrow are songs from two of these guitarists influenced by the walls. “One of them, Octávio Sérgio, who is now 88, was the last guitarist to accompany José Afonso, having a very interesting work. We can put this work in the continuity of Carlos Paredes, even more than Artur Paredes. I personally know Octavio Sérgio and I have studied his work. Then I end with my works, because the best way to honor the walls is to continue all this, we express it through the way they inspired us. A much broader show than a mere interpretation of Carlos Paredes's compositions, ”he explained to HM.
Genius limitations
Carlos Paredes was born in 1925 in Coimbra, on 16 February, within a family with strong connections to the Portuguese guitar. At the age of nine he was already following Artur Paredes and at the age of 14 debuts with his father in a radio program in the then national station.
The family moves to Lisbon in 1934. Along with the career of musician, Carlos Paredes was always administrative employee of the state, starting in 1949 working at the Radiographs Archive of the St. Joseph Hospital, until he renovates on November 1, 1986.
Musically, Carlos Paredes was also influenced by 60s musicians who changed the Portuguese guitar together, such as José Afonso, Adriano Correia de Oliveira, Luiz Goes and António Bernardino. Carlos Paredes's first album, the EP in his own name, came out in 1962.
However, and despite a life dedicated to fingering the guitar, Carlos Paredes “was never able to teach anyone,” recalls Paulo Soares. "I know you tried to do it, but the truth is that no one who touches guitar is known and who learned from walls. Artur Paredes did not teach anyone, just the son, was something natural. Carlos Paredes said that Arthur only gave him a right hand nomination to play guitar."
Paulo Soares confesses that he always wanted to learn from walls, but also "wanted to convey." "I do the opposite of what the walls have done. I have been teaching Portuguese guitar for 35 years and it has not died, because there is no way, since there are many people interested in learning."
Paulo Soares highlights yet another curiosity about the musical capacity of walls. “Carlos Paredes also said that his way of touching was full of limitations, which is true, although he was also full of qualities. Touching like Carlos Paredes is a way of showing his qualities and also that it is possible to overcome limitations, and is interesting in cultural terms and the perspective of the guitar.”
More specifically, the musician had "a way of touching that allowed him to express himself extraordinarily well, to touch his own compositions." "I know of two people who tried to work with Carlos Paredes and he was not able to leave his musical world. But that does not have to be a problem," said Paulo Costa.
Unconnected
Another limitation of Carlos Paredes seems to have been the lack of ability to manage a musical career. "I think he had proper recognition in life, but he himself was not able to manage his personal and musical life in a commercial way. This is written and documented, he had a chance to sign rained contracts that could have taken him from a certain misery in which he lived and he was unable to accept it."
"The feeling I have is that it was a person who took so much blow to life that only when he played guitar felt good. I think he was never able to make the guitar as a commitment," says Paulo Soares.
According to a biography released by CPM, Paulo Soares was born in 1967 and is today “one of the most versatile and generous guitarists of the Portuguese guitar”, studying and investigated this instrument “for over 40 years, seeking the excellence of sound and musical discourse”, being also “the deepest knowledge of Carlos Paredes guitar”.
“Its innovative synthesis of the techniques and intentions of the traditional guitars of Coimbra and Lisbon are the foundation for its enormous musical versatility and guitarism, full of enthusiasm and depth,” describes the same biographical note.
“As a pedagogue and driver of the Portuguese guitar, Paulo Soares's work is undoubtedly the most important. He is the author and editor of the Portuguese Guitar Method, a reference work in learning the instrument. He has consistently taught, has helped other teachers and has generously shared several transcripts of his own, being one of the greatest drivers of the modern development of our guitar”, is also referred to.</description><pubDate>2025-04-25 00:40:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Baidu | Launched two new models of Rivals from DeepSeek and ChatgPT</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/28/baidu-lancados-dois-novos-modelos-de-ia-rivais-da-deepseek-e-chatgpt/</link><description>Chinese Baidu announced Friday the launch of two new models of Artificial Intelligence (IA), Ernie 4.5 shift and Ernie X1 Turbo, in a conjuncture of intense competition from this technology after the impulse given by DeepSeek to the sector.

April 15, 2025
Following the article in early April 2025, it is recalled that the new silk route is born in 2013 at the initiative of the current Chinese president, Xi Jinping, having been announced in Kazakhstan, initially with the six land corridors, later with a sea silk route and very recently with another sea route, the Polar Silk route, with the purpose of connecting Europe, Africa and Asia and, and, Asia and After all, also the rest of the world.
Let us also remember that according to experts in international and geopolitical relations, such as Professor Carlos Gaspar, the emergence of the new Silk Route, with its immense power of connection beyond chief, is part of a clear path of China, which gradually ascending the great power, first at the state level, then in economic terms and, lately, in the international domain.
Chinese connectivity power seems fully assumed and confirmed by the vice president of the Institute of Contemporary International Relations, Yuan Peng, in the theory of the three concentric rings or circles, which constitute the relational sphere of China: the inner ring of the 14 neighboring countries;  The intermediate ring that extends from the Pacific to the Indian and enabling in Central Asia and the outer ring that encompasses Africa, Europe, America and the two poles.
The question of knowing, following the words of Professor Carlos Gaspar, if the detected political, cultural, economic and technological connectivity does not presuppose existence in Chinese philosophical thinking of a principle of connectivity and, if so, when philosophies will be more active, or acts at the same levels in all philosophical currents.
The first part of the article was concluded, referring to the importance of Confucian Philosophy in the new Silk Route, as this is the philosophical softpower that accompanies the growth of the Chinese commercial network. Chinese links with the rest of the world are established on the basis of confusion principles solidly anchored in the Chinese tradition, dating back to the century according to BC, when Confucianism became the official ideology of the Chinese Empire by the hand of Dong Zhongshu (董仲舒, 179-104 BC), sustaining and justifying a meritocracy not only within China, but also throughout the world to the world to which The Chinese arrived and arrive. Thus, they are the five constant virtues (五常 wǔcháng): humanity (仁 Rén), justice (义 yì), rites (礼 lǐ), wisdom (智 zhì) and confidence (信 xìn), which allow, on the one hand, policy directly in ethics, enabling a good government to all Chinese on the basis of constant virtues, on the other, themselves Outside China, they are guided by Confucian virtues in the name of a harmoniously shared future. In Confucian philosophy, there is, therefore, at the level of an ethical-moral connectivity, which enables harmonious social relations, being the visible face of the principle of connectivity.
The principle under consideration may assume other facets if the optics go to philosophies providing cosmological and ontological explanations of existence, as is the case with Taoist philosophy. Here the principle of connectivity moves from society to ontology and cosmology. All beings without exception are linked to the same root where they emanate, never losing their ability, whether they differentiate themselves or to turn to each other, or to unify with the source from where we are informed by the alleged Patriarch of Taoism, Laozi (老子), in Chapter VI of the Book of Road and virtue, whose text in Chinese can be found in the translation of the work by António de Obeu (2013: 38):
 谷神不死
 是谓玄牝
 玄牝之门
 是谓天地根
 棉棉若存
 用之不勤
That I would like to translate as follows:
The spirit of the valley never dies,
To which it is called mysterious female,
The openings of this mysterious female
They are called the root of heaven and earth,
Existing uninterruptedly,
Without ever running out.
All living beings are linked to the same root, where they spring incessantly through heaven and earth. They emerge, differentiate each other, approach each other and can return to the origin if they are emptying the "having" to start the return movement that may lead to the total meeting, as explained to us in Chapter XL (Abreu, 2013, 106):
反者道之动
弱者道之用
天下万物 1 生于有
有生于无
That I translate as follows:
The return is the movement of the Tao,
The Tao is practiced by flexibility,
Everything that is born of having,
Having is born of not being.
It is then for the emptying, for the "not having" that is returned to the origin, but while you have, you are also, and you are maintaining relationships, the closer to Tao the more flexible they are. We coexist in interrelationship in an understanding that escapes language, being absolutely intuitive, only he can explain that beings are unharmed from certain relationships, at very negative departure, because they remain flexible and as empty as possible. Knowing how to live, on the basis of this constant interconnection, it is a virtue in itself that obtains as a reward the extension of the energy of life, as perceived by the following excerpt from Chapter L of the Book of Road and Virtue (Abreu, 2013, 126):
盖闻善摄生者
陆行不遇兕虎
人军不被甲兵
兕无所投其角
虎无所措其爪
兵无所容其刃
夫何故
以其无死地
Following is the concordant translation with the Grace of Abreu (2013,127)
I heard from the person who knows how to live,
When traveling through distant lands
Does not intersect with tigers or rhinos,
Will not be injured by military,
The rhinos cannot give you the horn,
The tigers can't stick to you the claws,
Neither the soldiers have the ability to stick to the swords.
Why is this person like this?
Because there is no room to die.
In fact, the one who cultivates life is, according to Taoist philosophy, simple, light humble, quite empty, flexible, so it offers neither space nor resistance to others, which usually happens to complicated, heavy, full, rigid spells.  So this person is in the ideal situation to create good relationships not only with other people, in Confucian way, as with all nature, in the Taoist way. The other animals, however fierce, recognize holiness, and other humans, even though they are well prepared for war, as is the case of the military, have no desire to do so, because they do not find any tip of aggressiveness or resistance in this being.
These intelligent and communicating ontology and cosmology extend to all nature, in the net, through the exercise and cultivation of the right virtues, which in the case of Taoism are compassion, frugality and simplicity, as communicated in the LXVII chapter of the classic of road and virtue (Abreu, 2013, 161), having been widely developed by Zhuangzi (庄子) (淮南子) 3.
In Zhuangzi, besides the best known examples such as “Zhuang Zhou4 dreamed that it was a butterfly” (庄周梦蝶) or “joy of fish” (鱼之乐), there are others like the “empty boat” (虚船), which indicate the correct way to be in networking, like a boat with no one to the rudder, so that when another boatman comes in our direction, even if it is possible, even if it is Insulted because our boat was inadvertently against his (Zhuangzi, 1999, 322-323), or “when the shoe adapts”, and it is true that the best shoe is always the older and comfortable, when the foot has stopped feeling the resistance of stiff and new material, which bothers and sometimes leaves blisters and even the footed foot and in living flesh.
Follow yourself to the emblematic story of Zhuangzi, translated here by me (1999.313):
工倕旋而盖规矩 ， 指与物化而不以心稽 ， 故其灵台一而不桎。忘足 ， 履之适也；忘腰 ， 带之适也；知忘是非 带之适也；知忘是非 心知适也；不内变 不外从 ， 事会之适也。始乎适而未尝不适者 ， 忘适之适也。
The artisan Chui was better to draw circles than those who wore ruler and square, his fingers transformed, without paying attention, moving them with great agility and to-vantade, as forgetting the foot when the shoe adapts; Forget the waist, when the belt adapts and forgets right and wrong when the heart adapts. When we adapt to the outside world there is no internal transformation, no external obligation. Being adapted, without feeling it, forgetting even being, is the true adaptation.
 The Taoist virtuous person is supremely kind, as is the water, which is the image of the supreme good in this philosophy, as is well known by Chapter VIII of the Book of the road and virtue (Abreu, 2013, 43). Water is described as giving life to everything that exists, running free everywhere, given its excellent adaptation power. It can be said that it is before an “existential Darwinism” Avant La Lettre, which is cultivated with simplicity and affability, constitutive virtues of the traditional Chinese person, to which, in the social dimension, all other confusion virtues, starting with humanity and justice, going through the rites and wisdom that culminates in trust. Uma pessoa que cultivou o seu carácter, para os taoistas de um modo quase inconsciente, para os confucionistas de uma maneira deliberada e concentrada, obtém como recompensa uma ligação essencial à vida, colocando-se na rede existencial na posição certa  para ativar a Ressonância Universal (感应gǎnyìng), que nos vem do Taoismo, nomeadamente de Huainanzi (淮南子), cuja dimensão espiritual é  muito forte e será complementada pela Buddhist philosophy that reread all beings through the image of the web of Indra, the deity of the natural forces that protects and nourishes life, having hung in his palace on Mount Meru a web of silk wires that unites us all in the similarity of a spider web, extending to infinity and connecting in all directions. Each of us is a precious jewel that reflects and is reflected, contacting all the others by reflection. And Buddha adds to his disciple that being interconnected, we must take good care of each other.
Taoists and Buddhists agree to this mysterious ontological connection, based on a communication to an intuitive, almost unconscious level, directly linked to the heart, in the case of Buddhists, who will certainly facilitate social relations, especially when they are fair, since this same connection can strongly punish those who exercise their power by strength, for example, in the work of the early Han-titled dynasty (《淮南子》 Huáinánzǐ), having been the sixth chapter translated by Canadian synologist Charles Le Blanc under the title Huainanzi 淮南子 Philosophical Synthesis in Early Han Thought, subtitled The Idea of ​​Resonance (Kan-Ying 感應) with the Translation and Analysis of Chapter Six. In the first section of Chapter VI, in the episode of the girl who complains to the skies of the abuses of the Duke Jing5 (京), this complains a devastating natural response that leads to the death of this buried gentleman, after a trim, in the rubble of his pavilion (Blanc, 1985, 103).
The enigmatic universal resonance makes it possible, if we think in terms of the Buddhist web equivalent to Tao, spirit of the valley, a mutual resonance (相应 Xiāngyìng), which for Taoists such as Huainanzi, depends on spontaneity, also called this philosopher “pure sincerity” (ī Jīngchéng) (Blanc, 1985, 107).  Resonance can be relative and mutual or absolute and universal when you can achieve a response from Tao's own, which, when seen as a musical instrument, is the note that rules all the others (Blanc, 1985, 138).
The Chinese person, who comes to the rest of the world through the various terrestrial and sea corridors of the new silk route (新丝绸之路 xīn sīchóu zhī lù) connecting of the whole on a vast network, does not do than reproduce ancient metaphors and images coming from the various Chinese philosophies. Today's Chinese seek relations in a world that have postulated interdependent and connected since they started their philosophical efforts, with physical records that go back to the highest Chinese antiquity, but began to be organized around the 6th century BC in the school of Mestre Confucius [孔子 (kǒngzǐ), 551-479 BC], being very close to other schools and already Taoist and already Taoist and already Taoist and In our age for the various types of assimilated Buddhism, believing many of them still in our days that Karma, the actions practiced, will be determining in the web of Indra not only for the present, but in the web of future reincarnations. And do not forget that actions are always in function of someone or something, and is therefore the essential connection for the progression in the future scale of being, which counts to the same measure with past lives and the present.
Finally, the Chinese, even if not confessed religious, land cruisers and seas navigators, similar to our 16th century compatriots, have negotiating a specific cultural heritage, which must be known to not fear and that rests on the principle of connectivity at the most diverse levels: cultural and philosophical, political and social, economic and commercial.

Community concerns were revealed, namely regarding the permanence of the Noble Governor of Carvalho for stability and good business environment, as well as the “status quo” of Macau in the context of decolonization
 
The echoes of the April 25, 1974 revolution were late in Macao, but this did not mean absence of news in the following days, including the local Chinese press.
HM consulted some of the news of the Chinese newspapers of the time over this period, translated to Portuguese by employees of the Press Censorship Commission (CCI), the public body that worked in Macao during the Portuguese dictatorial regime. This material is today to keep the Historical-Diplomatic Archive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Lisbon.
Its reading allows not only to realize some of the events that succeeded the revolution, but also the perceptions and concerns that the Chinese community had on what happened in Portugal.
The Chinese wanted to maintain the stability and continuation of business. And if the Noble Governor of Carvalho, in power since 1966, was, for many, connoted with the fascist regime, and therefore had to leave, the truth is that many wanted their permanence to ensure social peace.
As read in the book “Macao in the years of the 1974-1979 Portuguese Revolution”, by Garcia Leandro, former Portuguese governor, “Macao's Chinese sought, above all, stability to be able to continue quietly to their business, and did not want conflicts or misunderstandings with Beijing or Canton”.
Administration was “weak, very badly supported technically and to be easily corrupted”, so there were “strong reasons for the local MFA [Movement of the Forces] and the CDM [Macao Democratic Center] want to change, especially for the permanent corruption and the sense of excessive weakness of the Portuguese administration, which seemed nothing to decide without preview of Chinese representatives”.
MFA explanations
Shortly after April 25, Macau was visited by two MFA representatives, namely Major Rebelo Gonçalves and Garcia Leandro himself, to explain the revolution and objectives of MFA to Portugal and the colonies, not just to the population but to journalists.
One of the meetings, with local journalists, was described by the Tai Chung newspaper on May 6, 1974. "Rebelo Gonçalves received the reporters and narrated them in detail the coup d'état. On the day (of the event), the song" Who sends the people "served as a sign of action." The CCI translator attributed to the song “Grandola, Vila Morena”, by José Afonso, chosen to be the second password of the revolution on the radio, the name “Who Mandates is the people”, in reference to the verse of the letter “The people are the one who orders the most”. The news continued, quoting Rebelo Gonçalves: he said "that the coup d'état was the desire of the people, so it achieved success in the period of one day."
Support to Nobre de Carvalho
Fallen the regime in Lisbon, and exiled Marcelo Caetano, the issue of the Governor's permanence at the head of the destinations of Macao was quickly asked. However, Nobre de Carvalho received popular support to continue, as described from the news of the newspaper SI Man, October 4, 1974.
"Portugal does not intend to modify Macau's status quo, a Portuguese delegate told Chinese traders. This delegate manifests himself pleased with the governor's re-competition campaign, promoted by several social sectors. However, Mr. General Nobre de Carvalho had already requested the dismissal of the position of governor for health reasons."
In addition, a group was created “for the collection of signatures in favor of the renewal of Mr. General Nobre de Carvalho in the position of Governor of Macao”, which were handed over to Garcia Leandro, still as MFA official. This one received "two boxes containing signatures-cadenic books." "Opinions of entities of industrial and commercial circles were transmitted, hoping that the governor can remain in Macao, which given his wide experiences and knowledge of conditionalisms, can overcome the difficulties resulting from the economic decline that now happens around the world."
But if the desire for many was the continuity of Nobre Carvalho, the departure of many civil servants began to be connoted with the change of regime. As referred to in the news of the Jornal Si Man, May 11, 1974. “The head of health and assistance services, Dr. António Joaquim Paulino, will return on the 27th of this month to mainland Portugal, which is reported to fall from Marcelo Caetano's government. The competent authorities refused to comment on the departure of Dr. Paulino.”
The newspaper also added: "However, news from Fidente Fonte reported: It is believed that the unappropriate return to Lisbon of Dr. Paulino, whose service commission in this province has not yet ended, is related to the coup (continental).
Still in early May, there were still many questions unanswered, and the newspaper SI Man associated the departure of Vasco Rocha Vieira from the territory, at the time of the military command of the Military Command, with the absence of explanations for the political situation. “A fortnight has passed a fortnight after the coup d'état in Portugal has been fully clarified that the political situation of that country was fully clarified. Although Macau is little affected by the event, the chief of staff of Portuguese troops parked in Macao, Major Rocha Vieira yesterday, which led many people to conjecture and suspect the junta of national salvation. Portuguese government had already started acting in Macau. ”
Ho Yin's explanations
Tai Chung Pou newspaper reported, on May 22, 1974, that "some Portuguese declared in Hong Kong that they were unhappy with the measures taken by the governor and the government of Macao", followed "for the metropolis to ask for the granting of freedom to the Portuguese of Macao."
Ho Yin, a striking entrepreneur and figure of the local Chinese community, who dialogue directly with the governor representing the Chinese authorities, explained in a session with “foreign reporters, as well as those of Hong Kong and Macau” about April events. These “visited Mr. Ho Yin, asking him for opinion,” describes Tai Chung Pou.
And once again, Ho Yin appealed his spirits, noting that noble Carvalho had all the legitimacy to continue as governor. "Since the Portuguese coup d'état, registered on April 25, Macau, given its special circumstances, has been felt, to date, very quiet, not undergoing any change. Mr. Governor, General Nobre de Carvalho, who has been in Macao for over seven years, has deep knowledge of the conditions of this city, having resolved many matters through conversations and widely efforts to this city," Ho Yin said, according to the journalists, according to the journalists, according to the journalists. newspaper report.
At the same meeting, the possibility of dissolution of the Legislative Assembly, proposal of the CDM, was questioned. But Ho Yin pushed any sudden political change.
“It is known that the Macao Democratic Center, consisting of some Portuguese, requested the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly and the Municipal Council [Leal Senate], as well as the remodeling of some public services. Some inhabitants thought that the assertions of that center would affect the social order, but they came to know that they were only the opinion of a small number of Portuguese, when the city is still the city quiet, after a few days. ”
The newspaper adds that Nobre de Carvalho publicly explained "that Al would not be dissolved, so the population of Macao became carefree and entrusted in the prosperity of this city." In addition, “tourists from Hong Kong, as well as abroad, also think Macao is quiet and is not affected at all,” read in Tai Chung Pou.
The Seng Pou newspaper also reported this meeting between Ho Yin and journalists, in which the Chinese community leader commented on the benefits of a democratic regime.
"Given their peculiar circumstances and due to the fact that the Portuguese and Chinese respected themselves and live in peace for a long time, Macau has not suffered any repercussions resulting from that Portuguese coup," Ho Yin said, stressing that "as for the freedom of the word, it has always existed in Macau."
However, the entrepreneur appealed to some containment in the political criticism made. "Democracy and freedom that are now verified in mainland Portugal are happiness to the Portuguese people. And the Portuguese and Chinese have lived in the past in peace, and it is expected to continue to succeed in the future. In the then, criticism of private people or public offices must be founded, since any thoughtless attack would make complications to the question, and affect its tranquility and prosperity."
Macau without decolonization
One of the questions emanating from April 25, 1974 was the most urgent process of decolonization in the so -called Portuguese Africa where the colonial war was due since 1961. First of all, the authorities clarified that Macau would be left out of this process, because “the Popular Republic of China was careful that in 1972, in the UN decolonization committee, to make it very clear that the future of these two European possessions [Macao and Hong and Hong Kong] would not be part of the agenda of the activities of that body, being the subject treated bilaterally, ”reads in the book of Garcia Leandro.
In the September 11, 1974 edition, the Tai Chung Pou newspaper wrote that “the head of the Macao Government Office, Lieutenant Colonel Henrique Manuel Lages Ribeiro, pointed out that news emanating from the news agency Reuters had been misunderstood, and that Macau has a peculiar position”, because “the way to solve his future is different from other Portuguese overseas territories.”
The words of Almeida Santos are cited, the Portuguese Minister of Interterritorial Coordination, who said “that it would be allowed to all Portuguese overseas territories to choose the form of independence as a means to solve their own problem, with the exception of Macao that, being a very special territory, requires a special way to solve your problem”. In the translation of this news, there is also a note written by the editor itself: "This means that there is no problem of independence in Macau."
The visits by Rebelo Gonçalves and Garcia Leandro Macau took place in “Finals of May, early June 1974. Almeida Santos was in Macao in September of this year and it was at this stage that Garcia Leandro was chosen governor of Macao, taking office on 13 November of this year.</description><pubDate>2025-04-25 00:18:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Death | Community recalls Pope Francis' dialogue capacity</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/23/obito-comunidade-recorda-capacidade-de-dialogo-de-papa-francisco/</link><description>It was 12 years ahead of the destinations of the Catholic Church. Pope Francis died on Monday morning at the age of 88. He also participated in the Easter Sunday celebrations at the Vatican, already quite debilitated. The local Catholic community recalls its legacy of dialogue and management capacity of various crises in the church
 
Jorge Mario Bergoglio will be forever known as Pope Francis. He died on Monday at the age of 88 hours after celebrating his last Easter before a Vatican crowd. Pope Francis failed to survive the complications of bilateral pneumonia, which forced a prolonged hospitalization for weeks.
The news of Pope Francis' dead was the world and the condolence messages and tribute multiplied globally. The local Catholic community was no exception. "No doubt the Catholic community of Macau was very staring Pope Francis a lot, thanks to his smile, no doubt it was a great teaching for the local community. People have always shown a great affection for the Pope," Father Daniel Carvalho told HM.
The priest highlighted the fact that Francis was the first Pope from Latin America, more precisely from Argentina, which was "a big news for the church." Contrary to the austere image of his predecessor, Jorge Mario Bergoglio quickly conquered the sympathy of believers and non-decisions for the simplicity and dialogue capacity with various social groups and minorities.
"He was a Pope who did not stand out for his intellectuality, but for pastoral work. He proved to be a person of much dialogue, someone merciful, and very close to the simplest, suffering people. He was an extremely accessible pope, showing a side of the church that humanity may not be used to seeing. A nearest, missionary church, open to dialogue."
Asked about the future leader of the Catholic Church, Father Daniel Carvalho says it is difficult to point out a possible name for now.
"The Catholic Church today has about 120 cardinals, so when the conclave happens there is always an election, and the candidate who gets two thirds of the votes is elected Papa. It is very difficult to get in the figure that will be the next Pope. There are always several possibilities. It is very likely that it is someone from the line of Pope Francis, because many of the current cardinals have been chosen by him.
Religion “For All”
Stephen Morgan, Rector of the University of St. Joseph (USJ), recalled Pope Francis' words in Lisbon last year during the world's youth days as to the fact that “Catholicism is for everyone, everyone”. "He was able to communicate this, and I think he was also concerned with ensuring that at the highest levels of governance, the church was representative and globally."
For Stephen Morgan, Pope Francis “had a communication and connection with people”, and created roots among the Catholic Church in countries in the south of the globe.
"Many cardinals have been ordered in places like Myanmar, Timor-Leste or even Mongolia, in a kind of recognition of the global nature of Catholicism, and perhaps it is something in Latin America, from the global southern America, could promote."
Over the course of 12 years of pontificate, Pope Francis approached the LGBT community and had to deal with the scandal of sexual abuse within the church. Francisco's position in this field is another point highlighted by Stephen Morgan. "He has done a huge number of things in terms of the church's internal governance, creating mechanisms of liability. I am not sure if the liability has already happened, but these mechanisms, in the crisis of sexual abuse or management of church goods, were really very important. He had an ability to relate to" modern "people because of his informal style," said the USJ rector.
As for the future leadership of the Catholic Church, Stephen Morgan also says there are still many possibilities open, taking into account the high number of papal voters. Moreover, "one of the characteristics of this Pope's pontificate was the fact that he did not meet with cardinals many times, and his predecessors tend to meet with the cardinals much more often." "Pope Francis did not do so, so they do not truly know themselves. It can be a very short conclave, with most to say," I know no one, but I know this person. "It may be Tolentino Mendonça, for example. It can take a long time to know each other," he explained.
According to Al Jazeera, in January this year there were 252 cardinals, and 138 have election power of the new leader of the Catholic Church. The new Pope will comply with the 267th pontificate.
There are several names that may succeed Francis: In addition to the Portuguese Tolentino Mendonça, there is the Cardinals Peter Erddo, Pietro Parolin, Cardinal Secretary of State; Peter Turkson, from Ghana; Luís Tagle, from the Philippines; Mário Grech and Matteo Zuppi.
“It is worth mentioning that about 50 percent of the current cardinals come from the global south. Therefore, the idea that the new Pope can be an Asian or African, not a Latin American, is high. But who knows?” He leaves in the air Stephen Morgan.
Next journey
Pope Francis' funeral will be held within nine days and the conclave to elect his successor within a month, the Vatican announced yesterday after the pontiff's death. This Sunday, Francisco was able to speak, sitting in a wheelchair, in the context of the “Urbi et Orbi” Blessing ceremony: “Urbi”, as it is directed to Rome, and “Orbi”, also directing itself to the whole world.
In his message, he deals with an advisor, he denounced the “despicable humanitarian situation” in Gaza, and an appeal was made to ceasefire. Pope Francis also warned of "the climate of growing anti -Semitism that is spreading around the world." "I appeal to belligerents to cease fire, liberate hostages and give precious help to hungry people who yearn for a future of peace," Francisco said in the message.
"Pope Francis' self-determined mission was to transform the Catholic Church into a 'campaign hospital' to meet the people where they are, without judging them, healing them with free remedies. So many Catholics loved him deeply," said Stephen Morgan.
The Diocese of Macau yesterday issued an official note about the Pope's death, recalling that he "was called to his father's house at the Vatican in Rome at the age of 88."
“Throughout his earthly ministry, Pope Francis ardently proclaimed the infinite mercy of God, sowed hope among the faithful, traveled many lands and took care of the most fragile, becoming an exemplary model of pastoral leadership,” is referred to in the note, following a comment by Bishop Stephen Lee.
“In this sacred time of the eighth of Easter, Dom Stephen Lee, Bishop of Macau, along with all the brothers and sisters in Christ, raises fervent prayers by the eternal rest of Pope Francis' soul and that he may be received in the glory of the heavenly kingdom. mourning ”, is referred to. The diocese says it will announce the memorial ceremonies of Francisco's death.
The note also accounts for the chronology of Francisco's life, namely the birth, on December 17, 1936, in Buenos Aires, with the name of Jorge Mario Bergoglio; and the entrance to the Jesuits in 1958, having been ordered priest in 1969. In 2001 he was ordered cardinal, and about 12 years later he was chosen as a Pope.
Beijing condolences
China yesterday presented condolences for the death of Pope Francis at the age of 88, and said he intends to continue to develop his relations with the Vatican. Francisco was the first South American and Jesuit Pope in history.
"China presents its condolences for the death of Pope Francis," said Guo Jiakun, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry at a press conference. The Holy See and China do not maintain official diplomatic relations, since the Vatican is one of about ten countries that recognize Taiwan. However, in 2018, Francisco's pontificate signed a historic agreement with the Chinese government about the complex issue of the appointment of Catholic bishops in China.
"In recent years, China and Vatican have kept constructive contacts and friendly exchanges," said Guo Jiakun. "China is willing to make joint efforts with the Vatican to promote continuous improvement of relationships," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-23 00:57:56</pubDate></item><item><title>Countries react to the death of Pope Francis at the age of 88</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/21/paises-reagem-a-morte-do-papa-francisco-aos-88-anos/</link><description>Pope Francis died yesterday at 7:35 am, European time, at the home of Santa Marta's house in the Vatican. The 88 -year -old Catholic Church leader had recently been in serious condition for complications of bilateral pneumonia, but recovered in time to be present at Easter Sunday celebrations at the Vatican.
However, several country leaders reacted to the death of Francis, one of them the president of Timor-Leste, José Ramos-Horta. Quoted by Lusa, Ramos-Horta said that it was not only the Catholics who lost with the death of Pope Francis, but all religions and humanity.
"All religions, all humanity, lost someone of great importance," said President Timorese, in a video message in Tetum, from Sofia, Bulgaria, where he is on an official visit.
In the message, the Nobel Peace Nobel Prize, considers that "Pope Francis was one of the most impact on the history of the world," which "embraced the poor, the fragile." "A Pope who did not hesitate to speak against the world powers that promote war instead of peace," said Ramos-Horta, noting that Francis also denounced the powers that ignore the poor and explore the weak.
Timorese head of state also recalled Pope Francis' words when he finished a visit to Dili in September 2024. "He held in my hand and said to take good care of this dear people," he recalled.
One of the last trips made by Pope Francis was Timor-Leste during which he met with the Timorese President with the religious authorities, civil society, and a diplomatic corps accredited in the country.
The Timorese asked to continue to build and consolidate the country's institutions to "be completely able to serve the people of Timor-Leste" and that "citizens are actually represented."
"The faith that has enlightened and sustained in the past continue to inspire your gift and your future," said the Pope, remembering that now Timor-Leste has a "new horizon, with clean sky, but with new challenges to face and new problems to solve."
India reacted
Another political leader who reacted to the Pope's death was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who pointed out Francisco as "example of compassion, humility and courage."
"Deeply sad about the death of his holiness, Pope Francis. In this moment of pain and memory, I convey my sincere condolences to the world Catholic community," said Narendra Modi on social networks.
"Pope Francis will always be remembered as an example of compassion, humility, and spiritual courage by millions of people around the world. Since a young age, he has dedicated himself to realizing the ideals of Christ. It diligently served the poor and the oppressed," he added.
Modi followed his message with several photographs taken during a meeting with Francis, showing the two hugging, and thanked him for the “affection for the people of India”, where about 26 million Christians reside.
The Indian leader had several meetings with the Pope, the last of which last June, on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy. At a previous meeting in 2021, the Indian Prime Minister invited the Argentine Pontiff to visit India.
However, in the US, there was also a reaction to death by the US Vice President JD Vance. “My heart is with the millions of Christians from all over the world who loved him,” wrote Vance, who is currently visiting India on social networks. "I was happy to see it yesterday [Sunday], although I was obviously very sick," he added, quoted by the France-Presse (AFP) news agency.
The president of the Philippines, the country with the most Catholics in Asia, today lamented Pope Francis' death and said the Philippines joined the mourning for the loss of the head of the Catholic Church.

With over 118 million inhabitants, the Philippines have more than 78% of Catholics and many faithful from other Christian confessions.
"Pope Francis taught us that being a good Christian means giving kindness and mutual care. His humility brought many back to the church," Marcos said in the condolence message quoted by the Spanish news agency Efe.
"As we regret his death, we honor a life that brought hope and compassion to so many and which inspired us to love each other as Christ loved us. It is a deeply sad day," he added. Manila Cathedral will celebrate a Mass on Tuesday at 09:00 local, presided by Cardinal José Advincula, in honor of Francisco, who became head of the Catholic Church in 2013.</description><pubDate>2025-04-21 23:56:10</pubDate></item><item><title>LAG 2025 | Facilitated automatic passage from foreign visitors</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/28/lag-2025-facilitada-passagem-automatica-de-visitantes-estrangeiros/</link><description>In the presentation of this year's security lines for security, Wong Sio Chak referred to the idea of ​​facilitating the entry into Macau to foreign visitors, with the creation of more automatic passage points
 
The Secretary for Security announced on Friday, plans to accelerate the border control of foreign visitors through the use of automatic electronic channels.
During the presentation of the Governing Action Lines Report (LAG) to 2025 in the area of ​​Security, Wong Sio Chak stated that the territory will extend the use of automatic passage points to foreign citizens without resident or work authorization.
To facilitate “exterior exchanges”, authorities will expand autoservice equipment to the biometric data collection system, which will apply to all foreign visitors, the leader explained.
To the deputies at the Legislative Assembly, the secretary added that the government will continue to optimize iris recognition technology in border controls and to study its extension to non-residents this year.
"We are also studying ways to widen the number of users eligible for automatic passage channels, allowing more foreign tourists to benefit from faster immigration processes and more fluid circulation in the large bay," Wong said.
Speech and company
In his speech, the secretary stated that "regarding the creation of a higher level of opening abroad, the input and output services will continue to be optimized and the facilitation measures of the border passage, to ensure a safe, effective, efficient and comfortable passage."
Thus, "with a view to promoting the exchange with the outside, the automatic passage channels will also have foreigners, so that they deal with the input and exit inspection formalities through these channels."
According to official data, Macau received, in 2024, 34.9 million visitors, 23.8 percent than the previous year, but only 2.42 million were international tourists. In October last year, the Chinese Foreign Ministry extended the Portuguese visa exemption policy, thus inserting Portugal into a list that already covered another 16 European countries.
The measure, which allows the Portuguese to stay in China for tourism, business or traffic for a maximum of 15 days, in force at least until December 31, 2025.
In the same month, Continental China had announced the expansion, from 90 to 180 days, from the permanence period for foreign residents of Macao on multiple entries in the country.
The measure includes permanent and non-permanent foreign residents of Macao that move “to the interior of China for short-term tourism, trade, visit to family members, visits and other activities”.
From July, the Chinese National Immigration Administration (NIA) had already allowed foreign permanent residents from Macao and Hong Kong to request authorization to enter the interior of China, valid for a maximum of five years. The measure covers members of the Portuguese community who are permanent residents in Macao and, until then, were required to ask for a visa to travel to the other side of the border.</description><pubDate>2025-04-28 00:26:03</pubDate></item><item><title>LAG 2025 | Hengqin will have a center for Lusophone and Hispanic trade</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/21/lag-2025-hengqin-tera-um-centro-para-comercio-lusofono-e-hispanico/</link><description>Hengqin will have a center to promote trade relations with Portuguese and Spanish -speaking countries. The news was announced by the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, in the presentation of the report of the government lines for this year
 
The government announced, on Friday, the establishment of a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages ​​in the neighboring Special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in these countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with the norms, training, arbitration and mediation”, said, in the Legislative Assembly, the Secretary for the Administration and Justice of Macao, André Cheong Weng Chon.
André Cheong's words, as part of the presentation of the Government Action Lines (LAG) for this year regarding the administration and justice portfolio, meet what government leader Sam Hou Fai, announced on Monday by declaring the intention to “promote exchange and cooperation”, through Macao, China and the universe of Spanish-speaking countries.
The Macau Forum was created in 2003 and, more than two decades later, the chief executive decides to extend the focus to Castilian -speaking countries. Cooperation should focus, as indicated in the general presentation of the LAG, among other sectors, in the areas of finance, culture, tourism and transfronic electronic trade.
"These are close countries in terms of culture and language, which are part of the Latin world. And we take into account the experiences of the past, culture, the entire political, social system of these countries," said André Cheong.
As a toast
Noting that the new space has mixed management, from Macao and the in -depth cooperation zone, the official also said that the “Commercial Support Center does not override the [Macao] Forum”.
Last week, Sam Hou Fai, Macao's first leader to dominate the Portuguese language, also suggested that he was going to take a visit to Portugal, scheduled for after the Portuguese legislative elections of 18 May, to move to Spain and “start contacts”.
The deepened cooperation zone in Hengqin is a project launched by Beijing in 2021, jointly managed by Guangdong province and Macau, with an area of ​​about 106 square kilometers.
However, a number of problems persist in this special area, noticed André Cheong, referring “the insufficiency in the development of the real economy, the high rate of eviction of commercial buildings, as well as the lack of circulation of people and commercial activity”.
In the second phase of the construction of this area, said the secretary, Macau and the province of Guangdong will reinforce “the interconnection of infrastructure”, “the articulation of rules and mechanisms” and the “approach of residents of Macao and Hengqin”.
Iam | Reformation intends to simplify organic structure
After changes to the Institute's Board of Directors for Municipal Affairs (AMI), namely the departure of José Tavares from the position of President, here are new changes.
On Friday, the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, said that "the current institutional organization [of AMI] does not meet the work needs of the institute itself nor to live up to the expectations of citizens", so that this year will be done "the work of restructuring in a phased way".

These children will receive 1,500 monthly patacas, ie 18 thousand patacas per year.</description><pubDate>2025-04-21 23:14:33</pubDate></item><item><title>LAG 2025 | Government wants to create an integrated vocational training platform</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/emprego-governo-quer-criar-plataforma-integrada-de-formacao/</link><description>In the debate on the government lines for this year, the Chief Executive highlighted the initiative to create an “integrated vocational training platform” for young people who have difficulty finding their first job. Of the 7,100 unemployed, about 4,000 are young people, said the ruler
 
There is structural unemployment in Macao and this is “notorious”. Representative NGAN Iek Hang raised the issue in yesterday's debate about the Government Action Lines (LAG) report and demanded concrete measures to the government. "Many young people have difficulty finding work in their area of ​​specialization, and many residents have tightened their belt and have been more prudent in spending. How will I improve employment support with a multidimensional approach, ensuring the use of residents?"
Sam Hou Fai, in his narrow as chief executive to present the lag and discuss them with the deputies, announced the creation of an “integrated vocational training platform” that includes government secretariats, local associations and companies to make specific courses depending on the needs of the business environment.

Attention to satellite casinos
Sam Hou Fai also recalled the unemployment resulting from the possible closure of satellite casinos as an example of the need for specific courses depending on the needs of the local economy. "Regarding the satellite casinos, we will have to see in two or three months to know the needs of the unemployed and then we can organize specific actions for certain areas," he explained.
The objective of the future integrated training platform is to “solve the problem of human resources”, given that hiring non-resident workers “is just a supplementary support measure that will be changed taking into account the transformation of Macau and its concrete situation”.
The Chief Executive recalled the training actions that already exist between the Macao Workers' Federation of the Federation of Associations and the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs, as well as the game operators. "We have to take into account the 1+4 diversification strategy and create courses that give diplomas. We have to rely on companies to combine efforts," he concluded.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>AL | Sam Hou Fai launches support for birth, but warns for budget revenues</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/15/al-sam-hou-fai-lanca-apoio-a-natalidade-mas-alerta-para-receitas-orcamentais/</link><description>In his first lines of government action, Sam Hou Fai announced the creation of a new “childhood subsidy” that will assign up to 18,000 patacas per year to permanent residents under three years.

Macao ended March with an surplus in public accounts that is already higher than the government forecast for the entire year 2025, was on Friday announced. In the first three months, the surplus reached 9.25 billion patacas, 11.8 percent than in the same period of 2024, according to published online data by territory finance services.
Authorities had expected only 6.83 billion patacas for this year. Macao closed 2024 with an surplus of 15.8 billion patacas, more than twice the one recorded the previous year.
The year 2024 was the first since 2020, at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, in which the territory was able to keep the accounts on positive ground, something required by the basic law, without transfers from the financial reserve.
Still, on April 15, government leader Sam Hou Fai admitted to fear a budget deficit in 2025, due to the slowdown in the game's recipes. Official data reveals a growth of 0.15 percent to 22.2 billion patacas, in tax revenues on the game until March, which still represented 88.4 percent of the total.
The six city game operators pay a 35 percent direct tax on the game's revenues, 2.4 percent for the Macao Social Security Fund and urban and tourist development and 1.6 percent delivered to the Macao Foundation for cultural, educational, scientific, academics and philanthropic.
The strength of the game
Until March, Macao casinos registered total revenues of nearly 57.7 billion patacas, more 0.6 percent than in the same period as 2024. Despite the growth in tax revenues, Macao current revenue fell 5.38 percent in the first three months of 2025, in annual terms, to 25.1 billion patacas.
The main reason for the decrease was financial revenues, which went from billion in the first quarter of 2024 to just two thousand patacas this year. This heading corresponds to the results of the Macao monetary authority, the region's financial regulator, including investment and interest and dividend revenues.
In the first three months, Macau collected 22.3 percent of the current revenue projected for 2025 in the budget, which is 112.6 billion patacas. The increased surplus of the territory was mainly due to public expense that descended 13.8 percent between January and March, to 15.9 billion patacas, especially due to a 21.4 percent cut in social support and subsidies given to the population.
The government spent 4.52 billion patacas under the Administration Investment and Expenses Plan (PIDDA), less 13.2 percent compared to the first three months of 2024.</description><pubDate>2025-04-28 00:30:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Big Bay | Sam Hou fai visits Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Jiangmen</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/28/grande-baia-sam-hou-fai-visita-zhuhai-zhongshan-e-jiangmen/</link><description>Executive head, Sam Hou Fai, today ends a visit to three cities in the Great Bay (Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Jiangmen), a ride that began yesterday afternoon.

The diplomat criticized the fact that the only direct air connection between Macao and Europe is not made through Portugal
 
Portugal's Consul General in Macao and Hong Kong, Alexandre Leitão, confessed to being “very angry” that the only direct connection of Macao to Europe was not made by Lisbon or Porto. The statements were made in a presentation of the Portugal Tourism Pavilion at the Macao International Tourism Fair.
“Days I wrote [a letter] to Lisbon, very annoyed, when Ethiopia Airlines opened [two weeks ago] its triangular load flight Adis Ababa-Madrid-Macau and with this created Macau's first direct connection to Europe,” said Alexandre Leitão, quoted by the Diário de Notícias (DN).
The Portugal representative at MSA and Raehk explained that for two years it was insisted with the authorities of Lisbon for the call to be secured by a Portuguese company, with a national airport, Porto or Lisbon, as a European platform.
“I have been insisting on this two years ago, so they do not convince me that it is not viable,” said Alexandre Leitão, remembering in Macau living 153 thousand Portuguese, inserted in a region that within 200 kilometers has two urban centers such as Shenzhen and the city of Canton, and Hong Kong.
"Here there are more than a hundred restaurants that complain Portuguese, there are dealers, there are commerce and this year will open two more Portuguese restaurants. I repeat, do not convince me that it is not feasible a flight that makes a dual function of transportation of people and transportation of goods," he said.
Sight of vision
Ethiopia Airlines flights will bring 20,000 tons of load per year “through a purely commercial flight”, between Adis Ababa, which is the African plate, Madrid the European plate and Macao.
"Explain me there why is Lisbon not an Atlantic and also European plaque, besides being Lusophone for markets like Brazil, which are served like no other? Or why African, Lusophone capitals, are not also instruments, distribution platforms of goods and services to other countries in Africa that want to come here?" "Anyway, I am not aviation technician, but until they explain to me for the most B that makes no sense at all, I will continue to insist on that. And I confess that the day the plane entered the airport, with the water jets, I was boring and wrote to Lisbon to sincerely expected this flight to consciously mean the relevant operators in Portugal, the government and the TAP."
Consul's appeal came to ensure that Portugal is positioned to take advantage of direct passenger transport between Macao and Europe. "All people interested in Portugal [look to] this potential before Ethiopia or other company anytime decides to make the flight of direct passengers to Madrid or Paris, wherever it is. So the task becomes more difficult. And this is the appeal I do to you," he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-04-28 00:27:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Government will tighten control the new synthetic drug</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/28/governo-vai-apertar-controlo-a-nova-droga-sintetica/</link><description>The government announced on Friday that it will implement more rigorous controls for a anesthetic used in a new synthetic drug, known as 'Space Oil', linked to three deaths in Hong Kong.
In the plenary of Friday at the Legislative Assembly, the Secretary for Security, Wong Sio Chak, revealed that the proposal of this matter was sent to the Executive Council and will be discussed in this advisory body on 2 May.
During the presentation of the LAG report for this year in the security area, Secretary Wong Sio Chak said the new protocols could arrive at the Legislative Assembly to be voted on urgent character in mid -May.
The secretary argued that the review will be "very complete" as it will include in a list of hazardous products targeted by restrictions not only the Ethomidate anesthetic, but also 20 other substances linked to 'spatial oil'.
Ethomidate, an intravenous short action anesthetic, is mainly used in emergency services, anesthesia units, operating rooms and intensive care units.
New Protocols
In February, Hong Kong implemented new protocols involving more rigorous control not only about drug storage but also on documentation and handling requirements in local hospitals.
Ethomidate was classified in the city as a controlled substance, so the sale or illegal possession could lead to a two -year prison sentence and a $ 100,000 fine of Hong Kong. But the drug was included in a list of hazardous products targeted by restrictions, raising the maximum penalty for possession of "space oil" to seven years in prison and a fine of one million dollars from Hong Kong.
The trafficking or illegal importation of this substance has become a maximum period of life imprisonment and a fine of five million dollars from Hong Kong.
Wong Sio Chak stressed that, both in mainland China and Hong Kong, it is "relatively simple" to restrict ethomidate use and punish possession or trafficking in space oil as it is enough to publish the equivalent of an administrative regulation. However, in Macao, vote is required in the hemicycle.
In early November, Hong Kong authorities confirmed suspicions that at least three deaths are related to 'space oil'.
Macao also revealed in December that police have detected four cases linked to this narcotic since the first case of 'space oil' found in a local school in October 2023. This drug is known in Hong Kong as 'Zombie drug' because it can cause serious physical and mental damage, including dependence, memory loss, seizures, loss of consciousness and even death.</description><pubDate>2025-04-28 00:24:25</pubDate></item><item><title>National Security | Government will create “risk alert system”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/28/seguranca-nacional-governo-vai-criar-sistema-de-alerta-de-riscos/</link><description>Security Secretary Wong Sio Chak said on Friday, as part of the presentation of the Governing Action Lines Report (LAG) for this year, that the executive intends to create “a risk warning system for the defense of national security, using technology”.
Wong Sio Chak added that this new system aims to "promote more effectively the modernization of MSAR capabilities in the defense of national security." In addition, it is intended to make “the restructuring of the composition of the State Security Defense Commission (CDSE) and the entities that perform complementary work”.
The objective of this renewal is to “improve the functioning of the organization, in order to expand participation in the work of defense of national security to all areas, and even to the entire government”.
The secretary also explained that he will continue to be promoted “the restructuring of the entities responsible for the execution of complementary work, in order to reinforce the functions of the coordination CDSe, decision making and impulse for execution”. The idea is to ensure that "the defense of national security is everyone's responsibility, everyone must fulfill this responsibility and everyone can act."
In addition, the government will consider the work of “qualification of candidates for deputies to the 8th Legislature Legislature by CDSE under the law, ensuring the implementation of the Macau principle governed by Patriots,” said the ruler.</description><pubDate>2025-04-28 00:23:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau wants to use digital currency for trade between China and Lusofonia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/25/macau-quer-usar-moeda-digital-para-comercio-entre-china-e-lusofonia/</link><description>The secretary for the economy and finance of Macao wants to explore the possibility of using digital pataca in trade between China and Portuguese -speaking countries.
During the presentation of the political program for 2025 in the area of ​​Economics and Finance, of the new government of Macao, Tai Kin IP said he discussed the idea with the Central Bank of Portugal during a recent visit to the country. A delegation led by Tai Kin IP was in Lisbon between March 4 and 6, where he met Banco de Portugal leaders, including administrator Luís Morais Sarmento.
At the end of March, the secretary's office said in a statement that the various meetings served to “negotiate the consolidation and deepening of cooperation between Macao and Portugal in the areas of science, technology, economy and commerce”.
Tai Kin IP said on Wednesday at the Legislative Assembly that he would continue to visit more Portuguese-speaking countries in the future to seek support for the use of Digital Pataca. The secretary promised to take advantage of Digital Pataca as a currency whose circulation will be free through the borders of Macao, an economy open to the flow of capital.
On the contrary, the Chinese currency, Renminbi, is not entirely convertable in other currencies, and Beijing authorities impose a strict control on the flow of capital, especially outside the country.
Seeds germinating
The prototype of the Macao Digital Pataca System (e-Mop) was launched on December 12, eight days before the end of the term of the previous government leader, Ho Iat Seng. In September, the region's financial regulator said the Digital Pataca could “serve as an example for Portuguese -speaking countries”.
Macao Monetary Authority (AMCM) President Benjamin Chan Sa San spoke during the second conference of the central banks and financial banks governors between China and the Portuguese -speaking countries, which took place in Macao.
At the opening of the event, Ho Iat Seng said E-Mop's development was supported by the Government and Central Bank of China, which was the first major economy in the world to launch a digital currency, Renminbi Digital or E-CNY in August 2020.
In September, AMCM explained that, before the official launch of Pataca Digital, it would take tests to identify risks and “establish laws and regulations”.</description><pubDate>2025-04-25 00:24:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Islands Hospital | Criticism of the few bus connections</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/25/hospital-das-ilhas-criticas-as-poucas-ligacoes-de-autocarros/</link><description>The Jiangmen community legislator, Lo Choi In, considers that current travels to the hospital implies a “tortuous route”. In addition, it asks for more directed buses, which do not coincide with some of the main tourist attractions
 
Representative Lo Choi In criticizes the few bus connections to the Islands Hospital, and asks the government to present plans to resolve the situation. The subject was approached through a written interpellation.
According to the Jiangmen community legislator, there are more and more people seeking to use the island hospital, because they have fewer users, which makes the queues smaller. "Given the reputation of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and the relatively low number of users during the initial period of its operation, many residents currently choose to move to the islands hospital," LO said.
The deputy acknowledged that there are routes available to the hospital, through buses 35, 50, H3, MT4 and N5, but that coverage is limited and leaves many areas considered important.
"The careers of buses do not properly cover the old urban areas of the Macao Peninsula, especially the black sand, inner port or the street of São Paulo, so the residents of these zones have to travel long distances when they need to go to the islands hospital," the deputy justifies. "Residents of these zones have to catch other buses or make a tortuous route, such as transferring buses to the light meter to head to the island hospital," he added.
In this scenario, he asks the executive if he has “plans to optimize bus routes” and recalls that current motors, elderly or patients are already difficult enough.
In addition to tourism
At the same time, Lo Choi In points out that many of the buses who move to the Islands Hospital coincide with buses used by tourists to move to some of the main attractions of the territory. This is a situation criticized by the deputy, considering that it makes travel unnecessarily more difficult for people who have a more fragile physical condition.
The legislator thus intends to know if there are “long -term” plans to create “more direct buses”, with “limited times, specialized and oriented to the places of residence of the people who most frequent medical care”.
In the written interplies, the deputy also addresses the issue of taxis for people who need to move in a wheelchair. It indicates that “the offer in Macau has always been lower than demand” and intends to know how the government will respond to this situation. The deputy suggests that there are “political incentives” so that local associations deal with this service, as this is not necessary to ensure profits.</description><pubDate>2025-04-25 00:22:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Pessah</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/28/pessah/</link><description>The long deserts are the scene of the formation of the cloud that guides and accompanies a sequin of immersed people to control the escape that the cloud continues to guide, and reappears in artificial intelligence when we ask and peer their gifts: accompany us. Those who were absent from the civilizing book content cannot meet the teachings that were still walking in the dark rows of the paths started, nor to make parallels to counteract the origin of the principle of similarity, which makes the contacts smaller and the dictates.
In the near future we can perfectly see a car of fire from the cloud bringing the prophet Elijah, and finally talk to him by cloudy teleport, we can see reborn from the cloud the dead that was buried, and other more transfigurations than just the surprising reading of something like this may have informed us first of all this that is now real. The alchemical testimony of the sacral cloud dates back to anything we should not forget, and the greatest deceit is that there is no correspondence of any identification between all that has been said and what is going on. Such a lack brings us to large black holes where the cloud passes without the same victory to know already known. Moses forwards, but the cloud guides more than him an entire tribe.
It will not be raining in the desert, and the cloud, fulfilling its nature will be referred to resurface as an emblem of a mental cycle and extremely poetic, from the same and precious adjective. It was long the way, strange the renunciations, misunderstood in the modern ignorance of his sacred labor, and useless the gamblers of competences that have harassed us these things.
A mother girl in the middle of this desert is also fertilized by the wind that transported the cloud, and from her said extraordinary things, but this girl is now as possible as it was for the legend to her condition, and no less likely in the gifts of these new interlocutors. Gabriel was a teleported teleported made of rarefaction and immanence that landed on the lap of a receptive and benign being to a caloric wave of severe suffering that was just an incident of course.
Secretly childish mimicry may also have seen in the appearances remember the cloud, and secretly inoperatively saw that there were no way to walk, deciding to speak. What clouds say can never be subscribed as an event of event, they are of a renewable but never dialogue condition. TAKEN THE TREE BY THE FRUIT OUR AGE WAS that of the confused, paralyzed, without a capacity people who allowed the cloud for Juno.
Today there is a strange and very beautiful peace that we can see up to our pains. It can be a spring night in telepathic contemplation with our distant avatar recognizes us and puts an end to the harsh crossing. What has been lived like this will not be recorded in the cloud annels that came to accompany us for the best that will always come.
Those who evolve do not emol, those who made the crossing do not retreat: neither Christ will come back, nor Elijah returns, nor Moses climb the mountain more often. They left for never again. Only now does the cloud goal surprise me in the face of renunciation of the old martyrdoms.
A very beautiful night where we are abandoned and without defense… Talking to the stars… confusing the distances… saturated with life… emerging from eternity! There will be roses on our cross, that the children of her man will give us signs to receive us free from all thorns.</description><pubDate>2025-04-28 00:52:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Where is the voice of reason?</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/25/onde-esta-a-voz-da-razao/</link><description>I recently read the article in a newspaper about the work of zone D of new urban landfills. In the article it was stated that the work of landfill and construction of the dike D of the new urban landfills had started, covering an area of ​​approximately 570,000 square meters, incurring a total cost of 1.53 billion patacas. The materials used initially will be sand and land from the excavations of zone A of the new urban landfills, thus achieving the reuse of resources and reducing costs. The work is expected to be completed in November 2029. Zone D of the new urban landfills will be intended for housing purposes.
After reading this article, I remembered that during the mandate of the former Ho Iat Seng Chief Executive, there was a suggestion to give up the Landfill Plan of Zone D. At that time, Ho Iat Seng called for residents to think rationally and remembered if there would be need and would be appropriate to lead the landfill plan, given that zone C of new urban landfills was already on the way. Ho Iat Seng pointed out that the land landfill plane could be executed at any time, but once it started, there would no longer be a way to go back. He expected citizens to consider whether resources should be allocated to other projects.
As much as I remember, the Government of MSAR has not conducted a public consultation or scientific assessment of the Dark Landfill plane. The land landfill plane may or may not be suspended, but in one case or the other the government will always present its reasons. As for the suggestion of building a sub-aquatic tunnel alongside the Noble Governor Bridge of Carvalho (the fifth Macau-Taipa connection) simultaneously with the land landfill work, it is a matter that did not come out in the news. So what practical effect has produced the expensive public consultation for the plan of new urban areas?
In recent years, the government has reduced the frequency of public consultations. News about the Governing Administration, including coverage of the executive's head of the head of the Legislative Assembly deputies, are often made available in the form of a press release provided by the Social Communication Office. On the other hand, the "significant phrases" given by the members of the government or the deputies of the Legislative Assembly rarely appear in the newspapers. Is this the new practice under the “Macao Macau ruled by patriots” principle? Or is it because journalists simply can't find news worthy of being published?
At the beginning of the new mandate of the Government of MSAR, there was an unpleasant incident when a journalist was prohibited from attending a session of the Legislative Assembly and was taken by agents of the Public Security Police (CPSP). As CPSP stated that this case could be transferred to the prosecutor to be investigated, I will abstain from commenting it. However, such an incident inevitably affects the image of the government of MSAR.
In the speech of the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, given in a banquet held earlier this year for Chinese Local Media responsible, said, “The media serve as a bridge between the government and the public, perform crucial functions in the supervision of government administration, give voice to the demands of the population, help to discern between right and wrong, cultivate social consensus and promote social harmony and stability. Opportune and rigorous reports, the media reflects the feelings and opinions of the public, making governance more aligned with the thoughts and concerns of the population of Macau. responsibilities. Freedom of the press is fully guaranteed by the Basic Law and the Press Law of MSAR. The Government of MSar will, as always, conduct law -based governance, support the media to raise their professional standards and improve their abilities.  It will also improve coordination and communication between the various departments and the press, providing information actively and offering more support to journalists to conduct interviews and reports. ”
Following a careful reading of the five priorities of the Government of the Government of the Government to the year 2025, apparently “raising the efficiency of masters' governance” should be the priority. Without improving the ability and level of public management of MSAR, there is no guarantees or safeguarding for the proper diversification of the economy, the offer of a quality life, the in -depth integration in national development or the beginning of the realization of works and projects.
How to help the media supervise the government administration and reflecting public demands is a question that must be answered when the time has come to "raise the efficiency of masters' governance."</description><pubDate>2025-04-25 00:42:30</pubDate></item><item><title>The Great America (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/24/a-grande-america-ii/</link><description>"What is Great About America?

Anthony Galli
The first, paradoxical answer is explained by the compensation instinct. Suicide, in two phases, of all former continental powers between 1914 and 1945, plunged from the World Statute to the regional status in the most vertical of the catastrophes, arouses the need for a reward. Psychogeopolitics of masses. If, as a state, it is no longer protagonist, the nation's (virtual) jump to Europe seems rewarding. In addition, the advantage of presenting itself as a participant in an immeasurable appeal civilization, not a transient and measurable political structure, guarantees against the refutation of history. The entity that does not exist cannot die. The “European project” stems from this cunning self-reproduction. Whatever the meaning of this genius, it is always in fieri. Sol do Futuro that typically comforts the present. Act of good faith even for atheists.
His patron saint, the Baron of Münchausen, knows how to get rid of moved sands through his hair. The only problem is that no external geopolitical actor takes him seriously. Let alone the United States and Russia. As for the second attempt to respond, it is about wearing the American clothes. We do not stop on the reasons that led Washington to remain in Western Europe in 1945. The main one is undisputed that it was to prevent the Soviets from taking it. Let us stay in the present. To make our task easier, we take a map of Europe seen from the United States and let us guide for a Virgil of safe empathy Trumpian, Sumantra Maitra, director of research and dissemination of the American Ideas Institute. The work fits the western facade of Eurasia photographed from space. Starlink perspective. It goes from the Atlantic to the deep Sármata plain and the Caspian-Cácaso area, passing through the Mediterranean, whose medium-oceanic vocation is immediately seized by the talasocratic look of the stars and stripes.
NATO thus emerges in its strategic ambiguity. There is no European power, nor American continental satellites capable of protecting themselves alone, for Washington this structurally defensive space can become offensive if necessary. That is, in the sacrifice of us Europeans for the salvation of America. Behind Trump's statement that all Atlantic partners spend 5 percent of his GDP in defense, the shadow of the NORSTAD doctrine is hidden, called in honor of the then Supreme Deputy Octa of NATO, former organizer of Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. That, with an eternal cigarette at the tip of his lips, he interrupted in 1954 an academic dispute between European colleagues about who should decide on the use of the bomb by saying “my gentlemen, we ask you to guarantee the defense of Europe with a number of divisions. Reasons. We accept them. That is, from America.
Duality of the American nuclear umbrella, animated by the new president against the "enemy" or the "enemy" against us. Illuminated by Trump/Norstad, see the map closely. The Atlantic unfolding looks concave. Designed to absorb an unlikely Russian robbery to the “old continent” and a less unlikely Chinese penetration, using the Russian Federation as a lace and exploring its advanced African posts, pointed to the heart of Europe. To attract us to a synocentric ecumenum with the persuasion of trade and the threat of strength. This interpretation, which currently prevails in America, can easily deviate to the offensive. Just conceive the scandinavian and anatolia as dedicated to the siege of Moscow. Many northern, especially Swedes, who were Atlantic champions during the Cold War on the ice, would be delighted. Much less the Turks saved a colorful revolution in Ankara (the ghost of Fethullah Gülen, or an American blow, continues to shake the sleep of imperial strategs).
The center of the map, divided into left and right flanks, is occupied by the Trieste-Danzig-Constance Strategic Triangle. The Julian Port, a sea viewpoint of the Avian bases and Vicenza linked to Ramstein the mother of all US facilities in Europe, is the pivot where the ports of Baltic and Eusino scale converge. Here, the atlantists are busy reinforcing military infrastructure behind the double veil (civil/military separation is for academic purposes and tactical camouflage). Trieste is the player around which he spins the NATO team, with Gdansk and Constanta as advanced wings. Aligned with Trieste is LVIV, the capital of Ukrainian Galicia, an indispensable advanced post for Washington. When the Russians tried a coup in Kiev on 24 February 2022, it was indeed in LVIV that the Americans and the British wanted to transfer Zelensky as head of the legitimate government.
Trieste is finally the defensive post-caster of Central Europe, the extreme bulwark after the GDansk-consumption and the virtual line between the crategate and the dardanelos. The left flank prevails over the right. Its strategic value is a function of the containment of Russia and China as arctic powers that advance towards America thanks to the accelerated fusion of polar gelos. The right flank is much weaker, exposed to the convergence of the war in Ukraine, tensions in Camuucaso Georgia and conflicts around Israel. We are in the seismic failure driven by friction between Ordolândia and Caosland. The Sicily Strait, a mandatory passage from the southern middle ocean towards the Indian Ocean, is much more exposed than the Mancha Channel, reprook by the Scandinava wing and the Baltic, festively linked to NATO. Having traced the backdrop, it is to leave Sumantra Maitra the task of deepening the perspective of stars and stripes from Trumpian logic. After having an indigestion from NATO countries, from the twelve founders to the current thirty -two, not counting Ukraine and Georgia that knocks on the door half closed, Washington is drawing informal lines in the North Atlantic body.
Starting with the obvious that is the Plettorica Otan Atlantic does not escape the law of any covenant, which distinguishes horses from knights (often only one). What is new to Trump is that hierarchies do not depend so much on the strategic value of individual partners and the will of the American citizen to pay whatever is necessary to defend them, even with blood. A mood of mind that is now rare. If the “starry knight” refuses to fight for the salvation of any of the thirty -one horses, it is as if they were doubly in danger as members of the covenant, considered an absolute “enemy” by Russia, and because they are expendable by the “number one”, careful not to impose an unbearable trial on the inner front. As Sumantra Maitra explains, no American patriot would think of dying by the Baltic States or Donbas, while he could sacrifice himself, "with some hesitation," by London, Paris or Rome.</description><pubDate>2025-04-24 02:06:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Daniel Pires, Pessanha Editor</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/23/daniel-pires-editor-de-pessanha/</link><description>The event that took place earlier this year at the National Library, Daniel Pires, researchers' master celebrated a discreet route, closely linked to Macau. Not only for that, but few names are as linked to the figure of Camilo Pessanha as Daniel Pires, who has become, over decades, more than one reader and an editor, the generous tool builder with which others could read the poet.
Anyone who has read authors, wanting to study them, knows how precious there is in the end of books an onomatic index. From the kingdom of paper, almost deceased, it was replaced by other things. But I would say that Daniel Pires's main activity, around Camilo Pessanha, is, above all, the creation of research instruments, such as an onomastic index. They are not visible, they are not showy, they are not even copyright many times, yet they are central.
Their activities around the work of Pessanha are not closed, always in Fieri. Thus, we do not say "were" because they continue: to organize and edit prose, build a chronology of life and work, gather and catalog the poet's private library, edit the correspondence. For example, the reconstitution work of the poet's personal library, published in the volume Clepsydra 1920-2020-Studies and Reviews (Documenta, 2020), organized by Catarina Nunes de Almeida, and that previous versions had come out in other places.
Already the chronology of life and work of Pessanha follows a parallel route, started with the Itinerant Biobibliographic Exhibition (1991), organized by Pires in Macao, where his catalog has been published, and deepened over the years in several other supports, culminating in a mature version in the correspondence, dedication and other texts (BNP, 2012). This chronology - far from being a repetition of those who came out in previous editions - is actually an increasingly encouraged version.
The portrait of the poet who, thanks to Daniel Pires, moved away from the abulical figure with which criticism so often left us. Today we know, with documents in hand, that Pessanha actively participated in the civic life of Macao, became involved in commissions, was a teacher, judge, translator, member of the Geography Society (partner No. 4421, as the Pires himself discovered), and maintained a network of professional and political relationships that make him an agent of his time. The correspondence issued in 2012 clearly reveals the republican and secular patriotism of those who denounced the disinterest of the Portuguese state by Macao and sought to improve the functioning of the local judiciary and pedagogical system. It is also important to note the value of the poet's dedications, carefully gathered by saucers in this same volume. In a writing author, these brief handwritten book offers are documents that expand the thickness of the work, revealing a lot of personal and intellectual networks of Pessanha.
Daniel Pires' intervention in the editorial domain also includes the collection tribute to Camilo Pessanha (1991), organized with the Portuguese Institute of the East and the Macao Cultural Institute, and above all Camilo Pessanha, prose and translator (1993), also published in the territory, where for the first time the prose and the translations of the poet. This edition remains, even today, the reference collection of Pessanha Prose - a work that deserved to have known edition in Portugal, which inexplicably never happened. Only the texts about China were republished by Vega, also in 1993, in an edition entitled “Second”, although the former came out in 1944 by the General Agency of Colonies, and the responsibility of another organizer.
Even Clepsydra, sensitive territory and disputed by so many editors, did not escape him. See your editing proposal, published by Books Horizonte in 2007 with beautiful illustrations by Rui Campos Matos. Clepsydra's gold was always the most coveted. But Daniel Pires showed us that also in the silver of prose and in the bronze of the seemingly secondary texts such as letters and arid documentation hides gold from no less glow.</description><pubDate>2025-04-23 01:28:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Mud | Cultural weekends at the Panchões and Museum Houses Factory</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/28/taipa-fins-de-semana-culturais-na-fabrica-de-panchoes-e-casas-museu/</link><description>Outdoor drawing workshops in the midst of the nature of the old factory of panchões and mud houses, and a lot of music. This is the offer for the May weekend in the Taipa Velha area, promoted by the game operator Sands. After a first workshop this Sunday, the next with Lio Man Cheong follows on Saturday
 
The next weekend, marked by another holiday, from May 1st-Labor Day, brings cultural events to the Taipa area, namely outdoor drawing workshops with Chinese artists and various concerts. The organization is up to the game operator Sands China. However, the initiative extends to several weekends of May.
The second drawing workshop takes place Saturday, May 3, next to the mud houses with the artist Lio Man Cheong. It follows, on May 10, at the same place, another creative workshop with Tak Seng Law, followed, on May 17, the session with Lam Chi Ian, this time at the former Panchões IEC Long factory. The opening hours are, in all sessions, from 14:30 to 17:30.
According to a statement from Sands China, these events intend to “show the charm” of the old zones of the territory, as well as “promote Macau through the integration of culture and tourism”.
Given the "huge success" of the first edition of the drawing workshop last year, the game operator "invited four macao artists again to guide drawing workshops in historical places", providing "art lovers an opportunity for artistic exchange with four renowned artists who will share their knowledge and ideas about drawing."
After the drawings made together, participants will have the opportunity to show the work in an exhibition at Museum Houses. "Through these works, people are encouraged to appreciate the macao landscape from different perspectives, improving the artistic atmosphere and promoting community involvement."
Music for all
But not only drawing this event. Young musicians will also have the opportunity to act on the weekend, more specifically between Saturday and Monday, days 3 and 5, every day at 3:30 pm and 4:30 pm, at the entrance of the old Panchões IEC Long factory.
Guest musicians promise to create “a melodious and festive atmosphere to this historical place rich in Macao's industrial heritage”, as well as “young musicians to gain experience and improve their abilities through public performances,” says the gaming operator in a statement.
Quoted by the same note, Wilfred Wong, Sands China's executive vice president, said the former Panchões Long factory “represents Macao's single history and industrial culture for over 100 years, while Portuguese-style museum houses are a popular place for visitors from around the world, offering architectural interest in the picturesque landscapes of humid areas [ Mud] ”.
The company aims to continue “to inject new elements in the [old] neighborhoods, reinforcing the integration of arts and culture with tourism to further develop the multicultural charm and artistic vitality of Macau”, said Wong.</description><pubDate>2025-04-28 00:50:54</pubDate></item><item><title>D. Pedro V | Carlos Paredes's birth celebration takes place tomorrow</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/25/teatro-d-pedro-v-celebracao-de-nascimento-de-carlos-paredes-acontece-amanha/</link><description>To celebrate the centenary of the birth of Carlos Paredes, one of the great names of the Portuguese guitar, happens tomorrow, at the D. Pedro V Theater, the “Concert of Tribute to Carlos Paredes”, with Paulo Soares, on the Portuguese guitar, and Rui Poço Ferreira, on viola. In an interview with HM, Paulo Soares unveiled the notes that will be heard tomorrow
 
This year the 100th anniversary of Carlos Paredes, named after the Portuguese guitar, and thinking about this is the House of Portugal in Macau (CPM) decided to mark the date with a concert that takes place tomorrow at the D. Pedro V Theater, from 20h00. On stage, there is Paulo Soares, guitarist, follower of the footsteps of the "walls", namely Carlos Paredes and his father, Artur, and Rui Poço Ferreira, on the accompaniment guitar.
Paulo Soares, who assumes herself as a “expert in all the music of the walls [Artur and Carlos Paredes], and not only”, teaches Portuguese guitar for 35 years and has been dedicated to studying the legacy of the Portuguese musician. But tomorrow's show will not just be based on the compositions of the walls.
“The show will be about the influence of the walls on the Portuguese guitar. Before Carlos Paredes we have the father, Artur Paredes, who was a revolutionary and virtuous guitarist in his time, with whom Carlos Paredes learned a lot. In fact, he always said that what he knew how to play had learned from his father. Carlos Paredes also had violin classes, and expanded what he learned from his father, in the way and the guitar.
This influence was found in many Portuguese guitarists, especially in the city of Coimbra, where there is also the musical genre Fado de Coimbra.
Thus, tomorrow are songs from two of these guitarists influenced by the walls. “One of them, Octávio Sérgio, who is now 88, was the last guitarist to accompany José Afonso, having a very interesting work. We can put this work in the continuity of Carlos Paredes, even more than Artur Paredes. I personally know Octavio Sérgio and I have studied his work. Then I end with my works, because the best way to honor the walls is to continue all this, we express it through the way they inspired us. A much broader show than a mere interpretation of Carlos Paredes's compositions, ”he explained to HM.
Genius limitations
Carlos Paredes was born in 1925 in Coimbra, on 16 February, within a family with strong connections to the Portuguese guitar. At the age of nine he was already following Artur Paredes and at the age of 14 debuts with his father in a radio program in the then national station.
The family moves to Lisbon in 1934. Along with the career of musician, Carlos Paredes was always administrative employee of the state, starting in 1949 working at the Radiographs Archive of the St. Joseph Hospital, until he renovates on November 1, 1986.
Musically, Carlos Paredes was also influenced by 60s musicians who changed the Portuguese guitar together, such as José Afonso, Adriano Correia de Oliveira, Luiz Goes and António Bernardino. Carlos Paredes's first album, the EP in his own name, came out in 1962.
However, and despite a life dedicated to fingering the guitar, Carlos Paredes “was never able to teach anyone,” recalls Paulo Soares. "I know you tried to do it, but the truth is that no one who touches guitar is known and who learned from walls. Artur Paredes did not teach anyone, just the son, was something natural. Carlos Paredes said that Arthur only gave him a right hand nomination to play guitar."
Paulo Soares confesses that he always wanted to learn from walls, but also "wanted to convey." "I do the opposite of what the walls have done. I have been teaching Portuguese guitar for 35 years and it has not died, because there is no way, since there are many people interested in learning."
Paulo Soares highlights yet another curiosity about the musical capacity of walls. “Carlos Paredes also said that his way of touching was full of limitations, which is true, although he was also full of qualities. Touching like Carlos Paredes is a way of showing his qualities and also that it is possible to overcome limitations, and is interesting in cultural terms and the perspective of the guitar.”
More specifically, the musician had "a way of touching that allowed him to express himself extraordinarily well, to touch his own compositions." "I know of two people who tried to work with Carlos Paredes and he was not able to leave his musical world. But that does not have to be a problem," said Paulo Costa.
Unconnected
Another limitation of Carlos Paredes seems to have been the lack of ability to manage a musical career. "I think he had proper recognition in life, but he himself was not able to manage his personal and musical life in a commercial way. This is written and documented, he had a chance to sign rained contracts that could have taken him from a certain misery in which he lived and he was unable to accept it."
"The feeling I have is that it was a person who took so much blow to life that only when he played guitar felt good. I think he was never able to make the guitar as a commitment," says Paulo Soares.
According to a biography released by CPM, Paulo Soares was born in 1967 and is today “one of the most versatile and generous guitarists of the Portuguese guitar”, studying and investigated this instrument “for over 40 years, seeking the excellence of sound and musical discourse”, being also “the deepest knowledge of Carlos Paredes guitar”.
“Its innovative synthesis of the techniques and intentions of the traditional guitars of Coimbra and Lisbon are the foundation for its enormous musical versatility and guitarism, full of enthusiasm and depth,” describes the same biographical note.
“As a pedagogue and driver of the Portuguese guitar, Paulo Soares's work is undoubtedly the most important. He is the author and editor of the Portuguese Guitar Method, a reference work in learning the instrument. He has consistently taught, has helped other teachers and has generously shared several transcripts of his own, being one of the greatest drivers of the modern development of our guitar”, is also referred to.</description><pubDate>2025-04-25 00:40:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinemateca Passion | Poster until the end of the month based on diversity</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/24/cinemateca-paixao-cartaz-ate-ao-fim-do-mes-pautado-pela-diversidade/</link><description>April is almost over, but there is still time to see a lot of cinema at Cinemateca Paixão.

Macau's Director of Tourism Services (STD), Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, predicted on Friday a climb of at least 4.1 percent on the number of visitors during the holidays of Labor Day. Senna Fernandes said she expects a daily average of between 127,000 and 140,000 tourists between May 1 and 5, a period of holidays in the countryside, known as the “Golden Week”.
To Portuguese -speaking journalists, the leader added that Macau could receive between 630,000 and 700,000 visitors during these five days, one of the high seasons for tourism in the territory.
The most conservative forecast would mean a 4.1 percent increase compared to the same “golden week” of 2024, while the most optimistic forecast would be a 15.7 percent rise.
On Thursday, the Macau International Airport Management Company admitted that it could fail the passenger and load goals set to 2025, due to the “geopolitical situation and world economic instability”.
But the STD director said that “it is still a little early” to lower expectations to the total number of visitors during the year, which had been set at 39 million.
This is because “really policies are changing every day (…) we don't have a global view yet what will happen, maybe in two weeks,” admitted Senna Fernandes. "We are very careful, we are observing what is happening worldwide," added the manager.
For whatever comes and comes
“We have to have optimism and do our work, but also prepare for what can happen,” said Senna Fernandes.

The Consumer Price Index (IPC) rose 0.04 percent in March, in annual terms, reversing a 0.16 percent retreat in February, according to official data released by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC).
February was the first month Macao fell into deflation since June 2021, when the city lived the last 10 consecutive month of price drop in the peak of the economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Deflation reflects weakness in domestic consumption and investment and is particularly severe, as a drop in the price of assets, as a rule contracted with credit, generates an imbalance between the value of loans and bank guarantees.
Still, the index went down 0.08 percent compared to February, a month that included part of the Lunar New Year, a high time for tourism. DSEC justified the increase in the index in March with the cost of meals acquired away from home, which rose 1.52 percent, while the price of sports and recreational services increased 3.37 percent.
Income costs and apartments mortgage spending rose 0.42 percent and 0.85 percent, respectively.

In the first three months of the year, the net income of Sands China, a company that controls the Casinos Venetian, Londoner and Parisian, had a 32 percent reduction compared to the same period. The results were announced by Sands China's mother company, Las Vegas Sands, through a statement.
According to the advanced figures, the representation of the US company in Macao generated a net income of $ 202 million, which is equivalent to 1.62 billion patacas. This total represents a negative difference of 32 percent compared to the first quarter of last year, when net income had reached $ 297 million ($ 2.39 billion).
The difference in income followed the trend of net revenues that had a break of 5.7 percent, to US $ 1.71 billion (13.74 billion patacas), compared to previous revenues of $ 1.81 billion (14.54 billion patacas). Revenues include not only the money generated with hotels and casinos operations, but also with ferry operations through Cotai Waterjet.
Despite admitting that in Macau the market situation is worse than in the past, Robert Goldstein, president of Las Vegas Sands, reiterated commitment and confidence in the territory. "In Macao, although in the current environment the growth of the market has slowed, our decades commitment to make investments that reinforce the attraction of Macau as a tourism destination and support the development of the world tourism center makes us well positioned to take advantage of growth in the future," he said.
Despite the optimism, Patrick Dumont, director of Las Vegas Sands operations, acknowledged that the company “has some work to do in Macau” and will focus on this goal to “improve business growth prospects” in the territory.
Good relationship with Beijing
During the results conference, Robert Goldstein also addressed the possibility of the American company to retaliate in Macao due to the current political environment between Washington and Beijing.
"I think we are not in the interior of China, we are in Macao, so I would say that there is a difference here. First, I think Macau has a different guidance in Face Beijing. Second […] I think we have an incredible relationship with Beijing and we have worked in this relationship for many and many years, and is very important to us," argued the group's president. "We believe a lot in the relationship between China and the US. We are very discouraged by what is happening right now. We hope things will return to the right way, but it does not take away my sleep at all," he added.
The company's leader also appealed to the rapid resolution of the latest disagreements: "I do not believe this mismatch among the most powerful countries in the world is sustainable and there has to be a deal," he said.
As for the mother company, which also includes operations in Singapore, Las Vegas Sands presented a profit of US $ 408 million (3.28 billion) in the first quarter, a reduction against the profit of the same-year-old quarter that had been $ 583 million (4.68 billion patacas).
However, the presentation of the company's results was marked by the announcement of Patrick Dumont, director of operations, which revealed that the company will not compete for a license to explore a casino in New York, to focus on the repurchase of company actions in Macao and Singapore.</description><pubDate>2025-04-25 00:29:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification as to their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

Travel agencies and tourism experts said they were optimistic about the performance of the tourist market during the next labor holiday, with the forecast that both domestic and international tourism will increase during the period, the People's Diary indicates.
Confidence is supported by the strong tourist consumption numbers recorded in the first quarter. China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism said the number of visits from national tourists reached about 1.8 billion in the first three months, an annual increase of 26.4 percent compared to tourism -related consumption of about 1.8 billion yuans (an increase of 18.6 percent on an annual base.
Lasting five days and starts next Thursday, the May 1 holiday is the last long holiday in China in the first half of the year. Based on tourism reserves so far for the holiday, many travel agencies expect the performance of the domestic tourism market to exceed that of the previous two years.
Tuniu Travel Portal said that by mid -April, tourist reserves on the national destinations linked to 100 percent compared to the same period last year.
Qi Chunguang, vice president of Tuniu, said that long-distance national trips and in-distance international trips showed strong growth. Autonomous and self -guided tours will continue to see remarkable increases as the holiday approaches, adds the publication.
Varied destinations
The Quin Travel Service Provider explained that tourism for cities, counties and smaller villages is presenting a high trend, especially among young travelers looking for unique experiences, with the main less known but modern destinations, including Pingtan County, Fujian Province; Yangshuo, Autonomous Region of the Zhuang Ethnicity of Guangxi; and Anji County, Zhejiang Province.
“I want to go to a crowdless place during the holiday. It's a good time to escape work and allow me to completely plunged into nature,” said Li Miao, 31, from Shanghai, who will spend four days and three nights in Anji-famous for his beautiful rural landscapes and well-planned accommodation-during the holiday.
Travel agencies and tourism specialists have also placed great hopes for the performance of entry and exit tourist activity during the holiday.
Trip.com indicated that the volume of reserves for its car rental services in international destinations should have an annual increase of 25 percent during the holiday. Popular international destinations remain those with shorter travel times, such as the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Singapore. In addition, more destinations - such as Qatar, Austria and Kazakhstan - are emerging as trend options thanks to optimized visa policies, increased flights and more air routes, the group said.

Chinese diplomacy chief valued the “Iran's commitment not to develop nuclear weapons”, both defending the right to Tehor to the peaceful use of atomic energy. Wang stressed that Beijing “opposes the use of force and unilateral illegal sanctions”, in an apparent reference to the sanctions that Washington imposed against Tehran.

93-year-old Zen left Hong Kong on Wednesday night after filing a court order to recover his passport, his secretary told AP. Authorities confiscated their passport to Zen after being temporarily detained under a national security law imposed by Beijing in the special administrative region in 2022.
Zen is among critics who in recent years have stated that the Vatican's agreement with the Chinese authorities about the appointment of bishops betrayed the Chinese Catholics who remained faithful to the Vatican. He also criticized the Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, the head of negotiations with Beijing, as a "man of little faith."
Parolin is considered one of the main candidates to be the next Pope, given his prominence in the Catholic hierarchy. On Tuesday, Zen issued a criticism of the Vatican, questioning why pre-competition meetings began on that day.
His secretary said Zen would return to Hong Kong after the Pope's funeral, which is scheduled for Saturday. But he said he was not sure of the exact date of the return.</description><pubDate>2025-04-25 00:44:49</pubDate></item><item><title>India | ORDERED EXIT OF PAKISTANSES COUNTRY UNTIL April 29</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/25/india-ordenada-saida-do-pais-de-paquistaneses-ate-29-de-abril/</link><description>India yesterday ordered all Pakistani citizens, except diplomats, who abandon the country until April 29, in retaliation for the attack at Caxemira Indiana, who killed 26 civilians and by which Nova Delhi attributes responsibilities to Islamabad.
"In accordance with the decisions made by the Cabinet Safety Committee after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Caxemira, the Government of India has decided to suspend the issuance of visas to Pakistani citizens with immediate effect," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
"All Pakistani citizens currently in India should leave India before the expiration of their visas," which will happen on Sunday, April 27, in the case of common visas, and on Tuesday, April 29, in the case of medical visas, he said.
The announcement was made at the same time as Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, promised to pursue “to the ends of the land” the authors of the terrorist attack that, two days ago, killed 26 civilians in the Indian part of Caxemira. "I say this to the world: India will identify, pursue and punish the terrorists and those who support them. We will chase them to the ends of the earth," Modi said in his first public response to the attack.
Dead attack
On Tuesday afternoon, at least three gunmen opened fire on tourists in the city of Pahalgam, at the foot of the Himalayas, killing 25 Indians and one Nepalese, according to Indian police. The attack, which India attributes to Islamists supported by Pakistan, is the deadliest against civilians since 2000 in the most Muslim Indian territory.
On Wednesday, the Hindu Ultranationalist Government of Nova Deli announced a series of diplomatic retaliation measures. Among the decisions, which are mainly symbolic, are the suspension of a water sharing treaty, the closure of the main land border between the two countries and the withdrawal of diplomats.
Pakistan, which denied responsibility for the attack, called on its National Security Committee for this afternoon to decide on a possible response.</description><pubDate>2025-04-25 00:43:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Tiangong | Sent three astronauts to replace space station crew</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/25/tiangong-enviados-tres-astronautas-para-substituir-tripulacao-de-estacao-espacial/</link><description>China yesterday sent three astronauts to replace the crew of the Chinese space station Tiangong, thus continuing to send astronauts to the moon and build a base in the coming years.
Surrounded by flames and tobacco, the spacecraft Shenzhou 20 took off, as planned, at the Jiuquan Lação Long March 2F rocket on the edge of the Gobi Desert in Northwest China at 17:17 hours to reach the space station 6.5 hours later.
The mission aims to contribute to China's ambitious goal of placing astronauts on the moon by 2030, followed by the construction of a lunar base. Mission astronauts Shenzhou 20 are Chen Dong, Chen Zhongruui and Wang Jie and will replace three astronauts who are currently at the Chinese space station.
Chen Dong, who has participated in the Shenzhou 11 and Shenzhou 14 missions, is the group's leader, while his two crewmates will make the first trips to the space. Chen Zhongrui was a pilot of the Air Force and Wang Jie works as an engineer at China's Aerospace Science and Aerospace Technology Corporation. Chen Dong led the construction of the space station during the Shenzhou Mission 14.
During the permanence in space, astronauts will perform experiences in the field of medicine and space technology, will perform missions on the outside and introduce improvements to the space station. China built the space station itself after being excluded from the International Space Station due to US national security concerns.
China's space program has grown rapidly in recent years. The Chinese space agency has already landed an explorer robot on Mars and a space vehicle on the opposite side of the moon. The landing of astronauts returning from the space station is scheduled for April 29.</description><pubDate>2025-04-25 00:38:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing gathers with foreign companies to understand the impact of tariffs</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/25/pequim-reune-com-empresas-estrangeiras-para-perceber-impacto-das-tarifas/</link><description>The Chinese Ministry of Commerce reported yesterday that it met with more than eighty foreign companies and representatives of commerce chambers in the country to address the effects of the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.
The meeting, chaired by the Deputy Minister of Commerce, Ling Ji, served to “exchange opinions” on the impact that US tariffs may have on foreign companies' operations and investments in China, the folder said in a statement.
During the meeting, Lin urged foreign entrepreneurs to “listen to a rational voice, maintain confidence, overcome difficulties and turn crises into opportunities” in the face of US impositions that, according to him, “severely impair” the international trade system.
The Chinese official also insisted that Beijing will continue to expand his "high -level openness", protect the "legitimate rights" of foreign companies, to "actively" resolve their operational difficulties and to ensure the "functioning of production and supply chains."
According to the statement, entrepreneurs said that the Chinese government "continues to attribute great importance to the resolution of the problems faced by foreign companies." And they expressed their desire to continue to invest in the country, since Chinese politics is "coherent, stable and predictable," the ministry said.
Barely
This meeting with foreign representatives, whose identity was not revealed, arises after Trump expressed this week optimism about the possibility of the United States and China to reach a trade agreement.
But Beijing assured today that "no negotiations or consultations have been started with the US on the rate of tariffs, and stressed that" any dialogue or negotiation should be based on equality, mutual respect and reciprocity. "
The commercial conflict between the two powers, which intensified in early April, raised concerns about organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), which warned this week that antagonistic commercial blocks between the US and China can cause losses up to 7 percent of world GDP.</description><pubDate>2025-04-25 00:37:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Álvaro Barbosa, vice-rector of the University of São José: “Student visa is very limiting”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/alvaro-barbosa-vice-reitor-da-universidade-de-sao-jose-visto-de-estudante-e-muito-limitativo/</link><description>The University of São José continues the negotiation saga with the Chinese authorities to recruit students from the interior of China. Vice-rector Álvaro Barbosa expects, soon, the increase in master's students from 30 to 200. Regarding the internationalization of higher education, the official advocates changes in student visas to facilitate recruitment
 
Does the recruitment of students from the interior of China remain a matter pending to the University of Saint Joseph?
It is a process that is underway. We have had huge support from the Macao government in negotiations to obtain the quota for our university, and they have been tireless in the effort to try to resolve the issues raised by the central government. Many of the questions are legitimate and concern concerns that arise. We were granted a temporary quota of 30 students for masters ago over a probative period, which served to evaluate how we, as Western University, would host students from China. From China, there is this concern with the host of students in Macau. I think we have made a huge effort and the students who are there, included in this contingent, are quite satisfied.
Is this quota for masters just?
Yes. For a degree we do not have authorization yet. In this way, we are currently at the time we try to overcome this probative period in order to obtain a quota of about 200 students for masters. We are in the final phase of the evaluation process and everything has been doing well. We will have the possibility that, next academic year, expand this quota. That would be great, because for our university, to have a greater impact of our mission in Macao, it is essential to have access to students from mainland China. We cannot be a university in an integrated region in a country like China, and not contact with students from China.
Is it more difficult for USJ to compete with other universities, such as those of Hong Kong, by foreign students, outside China?
The issue of recruitment of international students has become a priority for Macao universities. In the last two or three years, it has become evident that this internationalization is very important. What difficulty is there? There is the issue related to student visas, as these visas currently do not allow students to do any kind of work, denying them that minimum local subsistence mechanism to be able to meet expenses. Nor is it contemplated the possibility of, when the student concludes his formation, to be in the territory and find work. What all countries and regions that are competitive in higher education do, such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Australia, is to have incentive policies. Allow students to work part -time, for example. In Hong Kong when a degree ends, the student can stay in the territory up to a maximum of two years to find a job. This kind of measures do not yet exist in Macau, but I think the government is pondering this possibility. From the moment the decision was made that the internationalization of higher education was important, this must be accompanied with the corresponding measures. The current student visa is extremely limiting and does not encourage the coming to Macao to study, only allows coming. This issue was not as present as it is now, but now there is a strategic policy of internationalization.
It is also a matter of survival for local universities.
Yes. Perhaps there is no greater example of a catalyst for the diversification of Macau's economy than higher education. We have ten institutions, 60,000 students in about 700,000 inhabitants. This is the potential of internationalization, to foster diversification.

And also the research that comes out of higher education.
The investigation, the dynamics of the work that is done. There are a number of vectors that higher education brings to a region or country, this happened to Portugal, for example, with the policy of doctoral scholarships for students from abroad, which completely changed the dynamics of higher education. Cape Verde developed thanks to the impact of higher education.
Then we need to make the system more flexible in Macau.
I don't know if it's a matter of having a holistic view of strategy. There may be an idea, but then it does not intervene in all the necessary dimensions to achieve a certain goal. But I am very optimistic. I believe this new student policy is a key step to be taken in Macau. The internationalization strategy followed by all these countries and regions I spoke, and were successful in capturing international students, was always the same. No need to invent much. First, one should increase the capacity and notoriety of universities, and then a policy of scholarships, which will enhance a student flow, creating a reference for the territory, so that studying there becomes a habit. After this flow of students for a few years, an image is already created and some scholarships can be removed, which students will continue to choose a particular territory to study in it. Australia has a huge higher education industry, for example, and I think that in Macau we just have to follow the same strategies. We do, at USJ, that a little.
How, in concrete terms?
We offer many scholarships, and in this sense the Diocese of Macao has helped us build this flow of international students that allow us to create this dynamic that we hope will be sustainable by itself in the future. I think the government is also doing this. There have always been scholarships in Macau, attributed mainly by the Macau Foundation, but this measure will be strengthened. Solving the student's visa issue, creating a scholarship incentive system for five to ten years, Macau will have a bright future as an international higher education destination. But we need to invest, continue, and it takes a few years.
USJ created the “Macau Hub” platform, in partnership with the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in 2023. At what stage is this project?
This project has to do with our interest in developing a relationship dynamic of Lusophone countries centered in Lisbon in the area of ​​entrepreneurship, first. This cabinet we have at CCCM is not intended to offer training in Portugal, but we want to do something else. As we are positioned in the Great Bay and with Hengqin, where it is intended to activate a business ecosystem, we want to take advantage of the fact that we have relations with the Lusophone world to activate the access of the startups of Portugal, Brazil and Angola, above all, to the great bay and hengqin. We are trying to create a kind of incubator of transnational companies, in which we support the development of Lusophone businesses that want to settle in the large bay and also the reverse system. Strategically, for a university, it is absolutely fundamental to have a dynamic in the area of ​​entrepreneurship. Currently, more than half of our students do not want to go to the corporate world, but create their own businesses. Just as universities have to have employability solutions, they also have to have them for entrepreneurs, who are increasingly. So a university has to have a business incubator. My vision of the future for higher education goes around: a university, besides having a library and canteen, will also have its own business incubator. I would say that most students of management or economy courses dream of having their own business, especially in China. China is perhaps one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world. The CCCM welcomes this initiative in Portugal, but we also work with the Portuguese Catholic University.
And concrete results, already have it?
We have a number of small initial projects that are starting now, and we also work with many business organizations. We have now negotiated a series of projects, and I think everything will develop very quickly, based on the manifestations of interest we have. We were in Angola in December and we have already aligned a series of initiatives, we also have projects with Brazil and Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:56:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Adelina Moura, teacher and trainer: “The mobile phone is like a Swiss knife”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/adelina-moura-docente-e-formadora-o-telemovel-e-como-um-canivete-suico/</link><description>Graduated in the area of ​​educational technologies, Adelina Moura will conduct lectures to parents, students and teachers about the use of digital technologies in classrooms, within the “Letters &amp; Company” festival of the Portuguese Institute of the East. The teacher understands that prohibiting mobile phone in schools is not a solution
 
What are the challenges felt by teachers with the introduction of technologies in the classroom? Can the mobile phone actually be a complement to learning?
Yes. I've been saying this since 2005. The mobile phone can be an excellent learning tool, a means to motivate students and to enrich their learning. We have a kind of Swiss knife here, a very powerful equipment in the hands of the students and there is a school failure, because they do not work and help students enhance this equipment they have. What happens is that students learn in the worst way, in a destructed way, by attempt-rrove. There is a gap, as students are not alerted to the positive potential for mobile phone use. They face their mobile phones as a free time use, spending time on social networks and scrolling, and time consumes. It is essential that teachers are users, in their practices, mobile phones, and for the preparation of classes and other projects, to know how to prepare students. I consider that the school has lost several stages of students' preparation and awareness to use these equipment that lead to classes and with which schools have not spent any money. With the prohibition of bringing the mobile phone to the classroom we did not advance anything in this regard.
During the pandemic period, for example, the use of technologies, with distance learning, was quite enhanced.
But during the pandemic we also burned some steps regarding the use of digital by teachers, because before the pandemic many teachers did not believe or used. They thought it was a fashion and they saw no use in the use of mobile phones and other technologies. With the pandemic the use of these equipment proved that without them the situation of education would have been much worse. In these pandemic years, teachers have become more aware of the technologies that already exist and are available to anyone. With internet access on mobile phone, something that has existed since 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone, the e-learning system is enhanced and then we move to “Mobile Learning”, where you can learn anywhere and anytime with mobile devices. It is this reality that we see a little away from school.
And after the pandemic, how has it been?
I think we will take a few more steps towards digital literacy. With Artificial Intelligence (IA), it seems that we are as in the phase I created my first website in 1999 or email in 1995. We are at the beginning. But it is 30 years of technology where there have been many changes, and technology in fact goes on and if we immediately do not realize what we have available, we and students, we help create a moat that has happened in the past compared to digital. In the face of AI, if we do not look back and do not realize what was not done and should have been at school level, we are wasting time. Only a few years from now will people be alert to AI, and the gap is increasing. Hence it is very important to bet now, in this early stage, in the training of teachers, students and families.
Is there much ignorance of parents, removal from this reality?
We have parents who are from this century. That is, they were born with the existence of computers, internet, saw the appearance of the smartphone. But when they studied, the school did not talk about the potential of digital. So these former students came to society and did not bring this sensitivity to digital, to educate their children. We teachers, when we do digital training, are doing good to society because we are also preparing these young people for the future, because they will be parents and should be aware of educating their children. At school we do not only prepare for the job market, but for personal and family life. Hence teacher education is essential. The invitation I received from IPOR seems to me an excellent holistic view of everything, because the school includes several actors, connecting with society.
How should AI be introduced into the classroom?
We currently watch changes in search engines, in fact. We have search engines created from root to Age Age, for example. The best way to introduce AI into the classroom is to ask students and how they use it, and already resort to this tool. At the beginning of the academic year I always ask students to answer a questionnaire about their digital routines, and then I know more or less their practices. In 2023, when the chatgPT came out, I introduced AI in my classes, and realized that students were using this tool to deceive the teachers. Students have to realize that when using AI, they are falling into a certain trap because they are not learning. It is the law of the lowest effort, equal to the phase in which the internet emerged, when students selected, copied and sent to the teacher. We now have the problem that the answers are in Brazilian Portuguese, for example, and I see soon that AI was used. We have, therefore, to dismantle this action in the heads and face them. I tell them that they are being intellectually dishonest and that they have not read the AI ​​response, for example. Since 2023, I feel that students, in the answers to this questionnaire I do, say they are afraid to use chatgpt because they are afraid of being caught by teachers. That is, it seems to have gained some conscience.
It will give these lectures in a different educational context in Asia, where the use of mobile phone can be earlier. How will you deal with these differences, or do you understand that the problems of using technology in the classroom are transversal?
It is a transverse question. Do we have to wonder if the use of a particular equipment and tool will make us wiser? It seems to me not, because we may have the equipment, but the use we make it varies a lot. I tell my students that they should be ashamed, because they have much easier access to content than in my time, when we truly had research and read in physical format. I tell them that with this technology they should all have a grade 20, and that they are wasting resources, being dishonest intellectually, because they sign works that are not theirs and do not read, even, they deliver. One of the works we have with students is to teach them how to make bibliographic references, refer to the sources. But I am an optimistic by nature, and I hope that in a decade, secondary education students who are fathers and mothers will be able to deal with these problems of social networks and increase fraud with their children. It is this “parents school” that the school can help create. We are in a moment with no return from digital, and forbidding is the most comfortable situation, but it is not the best to face reality. We have to use the right words to alert. We have in this time of alerts and consciences, encouraging the critical spirit of our students, which is little today.

Speaking to HM, the academic enhances the interconnection between tourism, economy and geography, and lists its possibilities, limitations and effects, including Macao
 
 
In this book it speaks of the concept of “spatial economy”, in connection with tourism and geography. How is this connection?
Economic geography combines the geographical context with economic processes, being studied the spatial distribution of economic activities. The economy of tourism is particularly sensitive to these geographical constraints, as they are the characteristics of each place that enhances the development of certain products or services. These characteristics widely exceed the physical aspects of the territory and also include culture, history, ways of life or even institutions and legal frameworks. The case of casino, something particularly important in Macao, is a good example of the importance of legal aspects to develop certain types of tourism. Economic geography has a wider scope than the spatial economy, more focused on strictly economic aspects. Being evident in tourism this relationship between economics and geography, this book establishes a double approach that systematizes the interdependence of these three aspects it refers. First explores how the concepts and theories of economic geography can apply to tourism. In the second half it makes the opposite route, discussing how the analysis of relevant problems of contemporary tourism justifies the use of economic geography. Examples are the degradation of local resources, environmental impacts, contribution to climate change, acceleration of gentrification processes or disturbance of community modes of life.
Can having an excessively -dependent economy of tourism constitute a problem or salvation?
The two things, and are both cases that economic geography can help to understand. The industrialization of economies is linked to the agglomeration processes of activities that reinforce each other when they reach a certain scale. This allows the massification of production and consumption, with reasonable costs. Contemporary industries, more associated with the integration of digital technologies and creative processes, are less clustered in specialized industrial development zones, but tend to focus on large cities and metropolitan areas. It also follows that rural areas, islands, or sites that have not followed industrialization processes, have more difficulty mobilizing investments, technologies or qualified people to innovate and develop new industries. In such cases, tourism often appears as the possible solution as it can be developed with incorporation of technology and relatively low knowledge. On the other hand, tourism consumption, not being essential to human life, is very sensitive to income fluctuations.
Can you give examples?
This was visible, for example, with the 2007/2009 international crisis. Tourism is also very vulnerable to safety problems or international epidemics, such as COVID-19 has demonstrated to the extreme. Economies too specialized in tourism are very vulnerable to external shocks and less resilient to crises. It is also visible that, being the tourist development often supported by intensive and weak labor services, the specialization in tourism can cause, in the long run, embarrassment in terms of population qualifications, the ability to innovate and integrate technology or to add value to the regional economy.
The book also speaks of “intelligent tourism” and “co-creation of experiences”, using the megados and IA. Is tourism definitely becoming more digital?
Social networks are fundamental instruments for new generations. However, they began to generalize the tools for planning or promotion of travel supported by artificial intelligence. The so-called “intelligent tourism” more generally designates the use of digital technologies to intensify information flows, consolidate the formation of networks and promote more informed and shared decision making, eventually contributing to the so-called “co-creation of experiences”. Tourism digitization has its origins in service distribution systems originally developed by airlines since the 1960s, but it would be the internet to accelerate and globalize digitization.
And social networks.
The emergence of social networks promoted the creation of a more interactive universe, potentially in real time and involving wide numbers of users and various types of supports. The generalization of the use of mobile phones permanently connected to the Internet, even on foreign travel, has further increased this potential for intensive and interactive use of data and information. This "co-creation", however, hides obvious imbalances of power.
Such as?
With regard to tourists, or consumer in general, it is usually the role of providing information, for example through social networks. This information is obtained, accumulated and marketed, sometimes without consent or even without knowledge, to eventually translate into the creation, adaptation or promotion of products and services. This process is particularly important in the case of tourism, because there is usually a long period between the decision to travel and the trip itself. This period of travel exploration and planning is used by tourist marketing companies to try to influence choices. This type of interaction also introduces a difference in the “spatiality” of the provision of tourist services, which are usually produced and consumed at the same time and in the same place, in a direct relationship between producer and consumer. The digitization of tourism anticipates most of these interactions and information flows and transfers them to large technological companies or marketing and distribution.
Num mundo onde cada vez se viaja mais, os percursos são mais curtos e o acesso à informação é imenso, como podem os países e regiões ser competitivos na oferta turística? 
Contemporary tourism lives in a highly competitive international environment. But just as there is a wide variety of destinations and offerings, there is also a wide range of preferences and consumption, what is called “hyper-personalization”, the result of such abundance of information and opportunity for interaction. The challenge that is placed on destinations is to identify the resources, products and services that can be adjusted to a particular group of consumers, to communicate effectively. This competitiveness greatly goes beyond the strict scope of tourist services because it also requires mobility and transportation services, varied infrastructure, safety, medical support, or easy communication. Anywhere you want to develop your tourist industry have to intervene about all these factors.
The book also addresses how “social processes” shape the development of tourism. In the case of China, for example, do you believe we are watching a change, which will have consequences for Macau?
It seems to me that Macau is in a highly privileged position to develop other forms of tourism. China is the largest issuing market in the world, the widespread rise of income in recent decades allows many million people to explore the opportunity to travel. Macao is a very close and distinct destination, with its historical and cultural particularities. For the Chinese population it was not easy to visit Macau and there is certainly a great interest.
How does the Great Bay project come in this?
The strategy that is being followed by integrating the Great Bay allows you to develop a cosmopolitan and diverse offer that can certainly attract Chinese tourists and other parts of the world. Moreover, these three areas have excellent hotel and tourism schools, which guarantee qualified personnel for tourism management and planning. The element of differentiation that Portuguese culture introduces in this context can certainly contribute to the success of the transition from a casinos focused on other forms that value culture and heritage more.
Is it possible to have sustainable tourism?
The problems and difficulties of tourism sustainability are more visible than in other sectors. This “spatiality” of tourism (where the consumer is obliged to move to the place of consumption) implies that the consequences of this consumption become more evident. These effects are less obvious when it comes to the unsustainability of industrial units or intensive forms of agriculture in relatively isolated areas. As mass reduction and investment reduction strategies also apply to tourism, the consequences of the environment or the quality of life of residents in destinations can be devastating. Sustainability implies a long -term perspective based on the idea that today's decisions do not imply future negative consequences. Sustainable practices depend on the control of the impacts that accumulate over time by individual and independent economic agents.
How can this control be done?
When a hotel or airline defines what ability to install on their services they may eventually estimate the impact that consumers will have on the local environment or economy. They will have more difficulties in anticipating that impacts will be generated in the next 10, 15 or 20 years to investment. And surely it will be impossible to measure how this impact accumulates the impacts caused by other service providers, now or in the future. In other words, although the idea of ​​sustainability is widespread accepted, economic agents do not have mechanisms or instruments in practice. Regulating the use of resources and territories by public entities with a more comprehensive and future perspective can contribute to the sustainability more effectively than the regulation associated with market dynamics, which in many cases has been revealed highly predatory. The Chinese economy is one of these examples and may eventually benefit from it.
And in the concrete case of Macau?
Macao has historically known problems: ultra-urbanized and polluted areas, with large energy consumption and waste production; Great concentration of tourists in a relatively small area of ​​great historical and cultural interest; Great dependence on the game, with the resulting imbalances in the appropriation of tourism benefits. The ongoing transition to new forms of tourism should better solve these problems and state regulation will certainly have better results than based on market dynamics.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:28:16</pubDate></item><item><title>José Paulo Esperança, Associate Rector of the City of Macau University: “Languages ​​cannot be controlled”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/01/jose-paulo-esperanca-reitor-associado-da-universidade-cidade-de-macau-as-linguas-nao-podem-ser-controladas/</link><description>Co-author of the “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, with Luís Reto and Fernando Luís Machado, José Paulo Esperança reveals to HM that the work edited in 2016 and 2018 is being updated, especially due to the growing global value of the language. The Associate Rector and Professor of the City of Macao University suggests partnerships with Macau under the Editorial Project
 
Launched the “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, in co-authorship, about the global value of the language. Plan a new edition or update?
Undoubtedly. We are working in this regard, there was a recent conference in Macao and Professor Luís Reto, former Rector of ISCTE, presented some more current elements that were developed. He has worked on a very important issue, which is the role of Portuguese as a frank language, which was for a few centuries in Asia. The exchange between Dutch and the kingdom of Zion was made in Portuguese, because it was the common language used at that time, before English became the contemporary frank language. Therefore, there is a whole interesting story of Portuguese and the role it had in the first pinyins that existed, with the Chinese and the use of the [Roman] alphabet in Vietname. There are a number of elements that are not, therefore, very publicized, and the work of Atlas is the same, to disclose some economic dimensions of the language.
What are these dimensions?
One is the exchange of foreign trade and investment, which is very facilitated by the language. We also talk about migrations, tourism, students' exchange that is greatly influenced by linguistic proximity. Therefore, today we have a set of elements that are very interesting, and we hope to develop some more important partnerships with Macau.
As?
More at work, Professor Luís Reto is doing, which maintains an investigation team about the value of Portuguese. He has collaborated with the Portuguese Language Museum of São Paulo, for example. It is a museum space that was renewed after the fire that destroyed it. In addition, there is a project with Cascais City Council to develop such a structure, and we hope to do some works with Macau, in order to create three poles for the projection of the Portuguese language. As for Atlas' materials, we would like to have a continued update model, as this data is out of date very quickly. The work was edited in many languages, including Mandarin. This is the moment when we would like to give the book a more historical and deep dimension, with more knowledge about the teaching of Portuguese in the world.
What balance does this teaching do today?
Portuguese is developing a great deal of mother tongue and is effectively one of the most expanding languages ​​due to demographic growth in Africa, with countries such as Angola and Mozambique, which around 2050 will have populations of over 100 million inhabitants, each. The Portuguese thus consolidates itself as a language of the southern hemisphere, but much more from Africa, supplanting Brazil itself as the place of largest number of speakers of the language. All of this generates enormous potential, and this also occurs due to the great exchange of universities and internationalization of teaching. Today there is the possibility of Portuguese being a language of science, there is more publications in this language. This is a great challenge because English is the contemporary language of scientists. We want to contribute to all these dimensions, and Macau can also play an important role there. Macao is indeed a platform between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, and can play a significant role.
Is Macao an ideal place to train Portuguese teachers who do not have Portuguese as a mother tongue? Do you fear that the territory loses relevance in this matter before the offer of courses in the interior of China?
I see this question more as complementarity than competition. We have identified about 60 higher education institutions in China that have Portuguese courses, but I think Macau has very interesting conditions to start teaching from primary to secondary education so that children have been able to have learning from an early age. It does not mean that there are no young Chinese who began to learn their tongue in adolescence that they speak fantastically, which surprises me, but it is easier to start earlier and earlier. This will be easier in Macau. What is important is to create conditions for greater economic collaboration to many levels, such as joint research. In this respect, Macau has a very interesting opportunity. At the City of Macau University we are very interested in increasingly collaborating with researchers who visit us and work with our teams.
Can you give me examples?
Brazil is today one of China's great business partners. There is a lot of exchange in both directions, but one of the themes that is little studied, and in which I work hard, is the internationalization of Chinese companies. To what extent do these companies follow a model of internationalization similar to that of other countries that started this process earlier? I speak of the United States of America, the European countries, but also of Japan and others. China has, in fact, different models of presence in countries that are not yet well known, and this is important to realize, so that we know how to facilitate this process of exchange in a world that lives periods of some setback. It is very sad. I always remember a great economist of Portuguese origin, David Ricardo, who clearly explained how world trade is beneficial to everyone and how countries can take advantage of this situation. Therefore, applying tariffs, making such commercial barriers harms countries that are major exporters, such as China or Germany, and countries that today have a cultural export capacity, for example, and are not just importers.
In relation to the new Orthographic Agreement. It continues without a standardization in Macau. Does it worry it?
Languages ​​are dynamic and cannot be controlled. We think today in English, and we realize that there are almost incomprehensible ways to each other, such as the English one in Nigeria or Australia. Americans have difficulty realizing the Australians. In the nineteenth century, Portuguese from Portugal and Brazil were closer, then some disagreement emerged. There was an effort in Brazil to propose an orthographic agreement, and the Portuguese joined, resulting in a series of negotiations. There have always been resistances. I remember that Fernando Pessoa suggested the famous phrase “My homeland is the Portuguese language”. It was curiously a manifestation of some conservatism, because he thought Pharmacy had to continue writing with pH [Pharmacia]. In fact it did not make much sense. Portugal ended up seeking to impose a certain standardization based on the most genetic changes in the spelling agreement. It is not a process that has been running a hundred percent well, and has been universally adopted. African countries have become more defenders of Portuguese from Portugal. There is sometimes some confusion, but I understand that intercomprehension still remains, achieving a homogeneous language, more perhaps than English.

José Paulo Esperança is a doctorate in Economics from the European University Institute and was president of the ISCTE Department of Finance and Accounting - University Institute of Lisbon. The “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, with editions in 2016 and 2018, contains “a large set of indicators that reinforce the idea of ​​the growth of teaching, speakers and the written use of Portuguese in the world”, having been the target of a series of recent initiatives in Macao.
One of them took place on March 17, at the Rui Cunha Foundation, with a session of the “Roda de Ideas” cycle, entitled “The Potential of the Portuguese Language in the Contemporary World”, which was attended by the former ISCTE Rector, Luís Reto, and José Paulo Hope himself.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. In fact, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | Touring cars finding begins with greater presence Macaense</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/gp-apuramento-dos-carros-de-turismo-comeca-com-maior-presenca-macaense/</link><description>The Macao-Macao Road Sport Challenge Touring Car Championship will start this weekend at the Guangdong International Circuit in the city of Zhaoqing, 200 kilometers northwest of the ride. For this race, which will serve as qualification for the 72nd Macao Grand Prix, will be on the starting grid a dozen Macau pilots, including five Portuguese names
 
Among the sixty subscribers, all equipped with two types of vehicles - Toyota GR86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8) - are well -known guys from Macau's motor racing. With the same enthusiasm recognized for decades, Rui Valente will again drive a Subaru BRZ, the same car with which he competed in the Guide Circuit in November last year. Premium Racing Team driver had, in the last Macao Grand Prix, one of the fastest in terms of tip speed in the platoon of his race. Therefore, the focus on pre-season has been in other technical aspects of the car that go beyond the engine.
Also back is Célio Alves Dias, after a difficult year in 2024, far short of his expectations. For this, the pilot Macaense bet on changing the chassis of his Toyota Gr86. This year, its objective is to account for the twenty -fifth participation in the largest annual sports event of MSAR, so all the details are important.
Back is also Jerónimo Badaraco (Toyota Gr86), a pilot who, in the Macao Grand Prix last year, reached second place at Macao Road Sport Challenge. After having been modest in the finding events, “Noni” was very strong in the city streets, where he was the best Macaense pilot, in a race won by law Kit Meng.
In debut this year will be Maximian Mannão. Bringing with him a nickname with a huge tradition in Macao's motorsport, the young Maximiano, who competed for several years in the local Karting events and, in 2022, participated in a Formula 4 Chinese Championship race, will make his debut at Macau Road Sport Challenge with a Toyota GR86.
The Macanese presence will be reinforced by Dionísio Albino Pereira, a pilot regularly seen in the coloane Karting events, which will conduct a Toyota GR86 from LW World Racing Team. In 2013, he competed in the Macao - Macau Touring Car Series Tourism Championship, then driving a Honda Integra DC5 from the Pas Macau Racing Team team.
The representation of the territory in these findings will also feature Chi Wang, Carson Tang, IP Tok Meng, Chan Chi Ha, Lo Kai Tin and Lou Check In.
It will be to hurt
In 2024, the Macao-China General Automotive Association (AAMC) was able to place all the drivers of the Macau Tourism Championship in the end of the Grand Prix. This year, it seems that the scenario of organizing two races for local pilots will be impossible. As such, these qualifying races will have a much higher impact, and only half of those now registered will have entry ticket for the largest annual sports event of MSAR.
Another novelty for this year is that all cars will be equipped with tires of the Italian brand Pirelli, as had already happened in the Grand Prix. However, this year there will be a new compound, the same for everyone, which may shuffle the favorite accounts. Centralins will continue to be drawn, as in the past.
Since the number of participants is high, AAMC will divide the pilots into groups A and B, not two but four races in total. Each race will have 15 laps, two of which will be played on Saturday and two on Sunday.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GT Cup Right-Great Bay Race decides on Pingtan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/apuramento-da-taca-gt-corrida-da-grande-baia-decide-se-em-pingtan/</link><description>The second test of the GT Cup - Race of the Great Bay of the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix will not be played at the Zhuhai International Circuit, as initially planned, but at the International Circuit of Lago Ruyi, in the Pingtan tourist region in Fuzhou.
Sro Cup's debut season calendar was finally defined yesterday, with the official announcement of confirmation that Pingtan's semi-permanent circuit will host the third and fourth rounds of the GT4 cars on June 28 and 29. Pingtan thus joins Shanghai, Beijing and Macau in this year's calendar of the championship launched by Sro Asia in partnership with the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC).
The Pingtan track replaces Zhuhai, which was on the provisional calendar released in January, but could not confirm his event. This new date is also no coincidence, as the Sro GT Cup event will be part of the Pingtan-Macau cultural activities scheduled for June.
Pingtan's picturesque - which combines modern and coastal urban scenarios - remains widely unknown outside China. Inaugurated in 2022, the circuit has two strokes that incorporate existing public roads on the island of Pingtan, sections built from root and permanent boxes. Both SRO GT Cup races will take place in the 2.9 -kilometer circuit and 14 curves, already used by national championships such as China Endurance Championship (CEC) and the Chinese Formula 4 Championship.
Promising start
The 2025 Sro Cup season has spectacularly tore with 33 cars - GT4's largest grill ever gathered in Asia - to play two Formula 1 China Grand Prix Races last month. Integrated in the F1 official program, Chen Weian (Audi) and Lichao Han (Toyota) won the two races that will serve as the basis for the selection of competitors entitled to participate this year in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race.
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, which takes place at the end of the season, on the streets of Macau. The places will be assigned based on the classification after this second round, scheduled for Pingtan. In the dispute for a vacancy were in Shanghai six pilots of the MSAR: Kevin Leong Ian Veng, Miguel Lei, Cheng Tou Wong, Wai Ming Fok, Kim Hou Lao and Un Hous IP.
Charles enters the right foot
Still in the GT events, but in Australia, Macao pilot Charles Leong Hon Chio won the two races of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia inaugural journey in Sydney. The young rider of the territory, behind the wheel of SJM Theodore Racing's Lamborghini Huracán EVO2, has authored the two races played at Sydney Motorsport Park with authority, team with Irish Alex Denning.
Following a sensational season opening, the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia returns to the action next month, with the second round on the stage of the China Grand Prix, the International Shangoi Circuit, from May 16 to 18. After finishing second in 2024, Charles Leong is determined to win the title of the Italian brand competition in Asia in 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:47:39</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Tourism finding races took place in Zhaoqing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/21/gp-corridas-de-apuramento-de-turismo-decorreram-em-zhaoqing/</link><description>The 2025 edition of the Macao-Macau Road Sport Challenge-Macao Touring Championship-began at the Guangdong International Circuit, with 67 cars divided into two groups, A and B, disputing a total of four races over the weekend. Hong Kong riders again showed their superiority, but there were positive results among Macau pilots
 
In addition to the titles at stake, the competition organized by the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), which is divided into two events, also serves to assign the thirty-six vacancies available to the most important race of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. As such, this first journey on the circuit of the surroundings of Zhaoqing was particularly tense, with very disputed races between the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8), all equipped this year with the new DMC compound pirelli tires.
In the group it aligned three well -known pilots of the Lusophone community: Rui Valente, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão. However, a less achieved qualification left the three in the final part of the starting grid, forcing them to redoubled work in the first race, played on Saturday afternoon. This same race was eventually interrupted with a red flag a few turns from the end, due to an oil stroke on the track. Damon Chan, winner of the competition in 2024, triumphed, followed by Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping, in a podium entirely composed of Hong Kong pilots. The experienced Rui Valente starred in an excellent recovery race, rising from 29th to 14th position. Maximiano Mannão won three places and finished 22nd, while Célio Alves Dias climbed eight positions, ending at 25th.
In the second race, Rui Valente again printed a strong progress, spinning 5th, but the degradation of the tires prevented him from maintaining the position, ending in 7th. With a scoring system that privileges the top ten classifieds, this result may be decisive for their qualification for the Great Award. In his weekend debuts to the commands of a Maximian Maão Tourism car, whose Toyota boasts the colors and the logo of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended in 15th. Célio Alves Dias, on a complicated weekend, was only 23rd and knows that there is a lot to do if you want to qualify next month. The victory was up to Lo Pak Yu, pressured closely by Wong Chuk Pan and Leong Keng Hei. The best representative in the territory was Lou Check In with a 4th place.
MSAR VICTORY AND TOP-10 to Badaraco
Group B races were also marked by uncertainty and great animation inside the track. Chung Kwok Hei, winner in 2023, led the race until a hole forced him to leave. Cheng Kin Sang, representative of MSAR, took the opportunity and took the lead. Bayern Yip Wai Hei has released several attacks, all effectively defended by Cheng. However, an apparent accident on the main line, near the end, caused a new red flag interruption. Cheng Kin Sang won, ending ahead of Bayern Yip and Lam Tou.
In the second race, Bayern Yip exceeded Cheng Kin Sang on the second round and took command. Despite Safety Car's entrance twice, Bayern Yip kept his calm and secured the victory, winning a first and second place in the weekend. Rao Long, who left the eighth position, showed excellent pace and climbed to the 2nd place in the last two laps. Cheng Kin Sang concluded in 3rd place, adding two podiums on the opening day.
Jerónimo Badaraco, the last winner of the ACP Cup, in 1999, had a discreet beginning, ending in 19th Saturday's race. On Sunday, “Noni” showed that he still has a lot to give local motorsport, reaching a precious 10th place. Already Dionísio Albino Pereira completed the first race in 29th position and did not aligned in the second.
The next, final and decisive journey is scheduled for May 16-18, again at the Guangdong International Circuit.</description><pubDate>2025-04-21 23:40:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Table Tennis | Jieni Shao eliminated in the group phase of the World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/tenis-de-mesa-jieni-shao-eliminada-na-fase-de-grupos-da-taca-do-mundo/</link><description>The Portuguese Jieni Shao was eliminated yesterday from the Table Tennis World Cup in Macao, losing with Chinese Wang Yidi, the third of the world ranking, in the last game of the group stage.
The two players came to the last match to need a victory to be first in Group 3, the only position that guaranteed the passage to the qualifiers. This after, on Tuesday, the favorite Wang was surprised by the 39-year-old French veteran Yuan Jia Nan, who won three partials to one.
On Monday, at the premiere of the competition, Shao, current 52nd of the world ranking and the only Portuguese representative in the tournament, had tied two partials with Yuan, 44th in the world.

The monomocrete competition of the prestigious super -sports builder will have, once again, with a representation of the MSAR. Charles Leong Hon Chio will be again at the service of SJM Theodore Racing.
After last season Charles Leong and SJM Theodore Racing fought for the Pro class title to the last race, this duo will continue in 2025. However, the winner of the Macao 4 Grand Prix of Formula 4 by 2020 and 2021 will not form a team with Japanese Miki Koyama. Beside his side, the Macau pilot will now have young Irish Alex Denning, who last year competed at the European Series GT4 and will make his debut on Asian tracks.
Also new is in the SJM Care Team Theodore Racing, which is no longer Iron Lynx-a structure that, since 2021, controls Prema Powertaam ​​through Swiss company DC Racing Solutions Ltd. The relationship of Iron Lynx with Lamborghini Squadra Corso, an entity responsible for the Italian brand, deteriorated dramatically at the end of last year Due to a conflict related to the FIA ​​Endurance World Championship program (WEC). As a result, Iron Lynx has abandoned all activities with the brand of Sant'Agata Bolognese globally.
Given this scenario, to ensure technical assistance to its Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo Evo 2, SJM Theodore Racing will feature this season with the services of DW Evans GT, the team that, last year, won the Team Championship and the Asian trophy class, with the English-based English and co-owner of the team, Dan Wells.
There is no coincidence with the GP
The Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia intends to keep its momentum by 2025, with a calendar composed of six events in six different countries. The season will start, for the first time, in Australia, with the historic Sydney Motorsport Park to receive the first double round. Then the competition heads for Shanghai, China, for the second round on the weekend from June 16 to 18, marking its return to the calendar in 2024 after a four -year absence. Japan will be the host of the third round two weeks later, at the iconic Fuji track, while the Inje Speedium in South Korea enters the calendar in late July.
After having previously hosted the opening round of the season, Sepang, Malaysia, passes to September in 2025, occupying the fifth round of the calendar. The sixth and last race will take place at the Misano Circuit in Italy, together with the Lamborghini world finals. For the first time in several years, the event will not coincide with the Macao Grand Prix, competing in the previous weekend.
Absence of figure
Pro--class winner in 2024, along with Chinese Jason Fangping Chen, André Couto will not be present in this year's edition of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia. Madness Racing Team, whereby the Portuguese territory pilot competed last season, abandoned the trophy and has not yet defined his sports project for 2025. For this first race in the championship in Australia, there are twenty -three cars that will be driven by thirty -nine pilots.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:01:40</pubDate></item><item><title>FIRST RALENT PROOF FOR THE MACAU GP took place in Shanghai</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/25/primeira-prova-de-apuramento-para-o-gp-macau-decorreu-em-xangai/</link><description>The first determination test for the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix took place last weekend at the International Shanghai Circuit. Integrated in the Formula 1 China Grand Prix Program, Chen Weian and Lichao Han won the two races that will serve to select competitors entitled to participate this year in the GT - Great Bay Cup -
 
The GT Cup-Great Bay Race joined the newly created SRO GT Cup, the latest GT competition launched in the interior of China, inspired by the GT4 class vehicles of the Macao Grand Prix. Thirty-three cars, six of them driven by Macau pilots, signed up for this debut-a record number of participants in a GT4 category in Asia category.
According to the organizer's statement, Sro Motorsports Group, “the total number of cars and the variety of builders have even exceeded the organizers' expectations for a championship that only began to be discussed in late November 2024.
