Future markets in the US also closed in red, with S&amp;P 500 lost 4.2 percent, while Dow Jones Industrial Averag fell 3.5 percent. The Nasdaq index lost 5.3 percent.
Tokyo negotiations opened in significant fall, with Nikkei, the main rate of the Japanese scholarship, losing almost 8 percent, shortly after the market opening. One hour later, 7.1 percent was dropped to 31 375.71. The second Japanese index, Topix, also opened to lose 8.64 percent at the beginning of the session.
South Korea Kospi opened to lose 5.5 percent to 2,328.52, while Australia's ASX 200 ASX 200 began negotiations to fall 6.3 percent to 7,184.70.
The Taipé Stock Exchange reference index, Taiex, a few minutes after opening, fell 9.8 percent, losing 2,054 points to 19,243, with the Hon Hai (Foxconn) technology company, the world's largest manufacturer of electronic products, and the giant Taiwanese TSMC, which dominates the world chip foundation market, to also register losses close to 10 percent.
Likewise, oil prices remained a descending plan, with the US oil reference price to fall 4 percent, or $ 2.50, to $ 59.49 per barrel. Brent oil, the international standard, gave $ 2.25 to $ 63.33 per barrel.
The monetary market also registered major movements, with the US dollar to fall to 145.98 Japanese yen from 146.94 yen, and Iene is often seen as a safe port in times of turbulence. The euro rose from $ 1.0962 to $ 1.0967.
Recessão à vista
Na sexta-feira, no pior registo desde a Covid-19, Wall Street fechou com o S&amp;P 500 a cair 6 por cento e o Dow 5,5 por cento. O Nasdaq composto caiu 5,8 por cento.
The losses accelerated after China equaled the large increased customs rights announced by Trump last week, climbing the stop in a trade war that could end with a recession of the world economy.
Even a better report than expected about the US labor market, released on Friday, which usually assumes itself as the economic highlight of each month, was not enough to sustain the fall of markets. All actions of the 500 S&amp;P 500 index companies, except 14, fell on Friday.
China's response to American tariffs has caused immediate acceleration of losses in world markets. Beijing's Ministry of Commerce has announced that it will respond to US 34 tariffs imposed by China imports with its own 34 percent rate on imports of all US products from 10 April, among other measures.
The United States and China are the two largest economies in the world. Trump announced on Wednesday that he will impose tariffs on countries around the world. About the rates, the US president said they "will bring growth like never seen" and "faster than you think."
In the case of the EU, Trump said that the fare will be 20 percent, since, he explained, the European Block taxes US products at 39 percent, on average, while South Korea, for example, tributes at almost 50 percent on average. The tariffs imposed by the United States on South Korean products will be 26 percent.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:48:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Road Works | Au Kam San criticizes administration</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/obras-viarias-au-kam-san-critica-funcionamento-da-administracao/</link><description>Former Deputy Au Kam San criticizes the bureaucracy of the working group for the optimization of the Coordination of Road Works, launched by the Chief Executive.

The proposal, launched in a public tender by invitation by the Institute for Macao Municipal Affairs in early 2024, aimed to “create an accessible pedestrian route that would connect the two ends of the beach, incorporating simultaneously leisure facilities”, describes the statement.
"Park of Tides" is inspired "in the natural rhythm of the tides", having an area of ​​12 thousand square meters, where it reinterprets "the route with an expansion in the form of wave". In this proposal, it is foreseen “a modern, green and accessible space by the sea, which values ​​the natural beauty and recreational value of Hac Sá beach”.
Nuno Soares also developed three zones, centered on leisure and interactive spaces, exploration of natural materials and outdoor activities and another place with “design and contemporary facilities”. Thus, together, these three zones "reimagine the riverside area as a multifunctional and inclusive destination for visitors to engage, explore and relax."
Cited by the same note, Nuno Soares explained that this project “adopts a minimal impact approach, where permeable structures and natural materials are involved with the terrain”, as well as representing a “commitment” of the studio “with sustainable and inclusive architectural practices, ensuring ecological preservation while increasing the well-being of the community”.
The London Design Awards, together with the International Awards Associate, recognize projects that are exceptional and creative influence proposing to promote works of designers involved in various fields, bringing recognition those who overcome the industry.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:43:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | Dealerships with sharp breakdown</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/jogo-accoes-das-concessionarias-com-quebras-acentuadas/</link><description>SJM actions recorded the highest devaluation, with a loss of 17.62 percent. Accounting yesterday, since the beginning of the year, the companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange are losing value
 
Hong Kong Stock Exchange concessionaire shares recorded strong breaks, following the trend of world markets after US President Donald Trump has decided to impose new rates on imported products by the US country.
Yesterday, the Hang Seng Index, the main Hong Kong Stock Exchange, had a 13.62 percent break, and Macao dealers followed the trend, with similar losses.
In relative terms, SJM was the company with the highest devaluation, with the price of actions to fall 17.62 percent. At the time of opening the market, each action was valued at $ 2.44 of Hong Kong, but at the time of the closure the value had fallen to $ 2.01 of Hong Kong per action.

Wynn Macau dealership had a value reduction from $ 13.02, from $ 5.13 to $ 4,81. Lastly, in what was the least pronounced devaluation, MGM China's actions fell 12.18 percent from 9.5 dollars from Hong Kong to $ 4.181.
Negative tendency
Although at a faster pace yesterday, since the beginning of the year, the dealerships are falling, in which it has been a trend against the Hang Seng Index, which despite yesterday's debacle has been valuing 1.04 percent since the beginning of the year.
The most affected concessionaire for the loss of value is Sands China, which since the beginning of the year has devalued 28.5 percent, 18.6 dollars from Hong Kong per $ 13.3. At the level of losses follows Melco with a devaluation of 23.3 percent, from $ 4.3 to 3.3 dollars of Hong Kong per action.

According to the company, after years in denial, the landlords of stores begin to realize that they will lose money
 
The Centaline Real Estate Agency foresees that housing prices will have a broken 10 to 20 percent throughout the year. The forecast appears in the agency's latest report on the local real estate market, published at the end of last week, and points out that the sector crosses an "ice age."
"The Macao real estate market is going through a 'U' form phase of development, so the pressure to reduce housing prices are expected to extend," is mentioned. "Housing prices will cross a new vacancy of breaks between 10 and 20 percent," he was added.
By referring to the form of “U”, the centine predicts that the fall is followed by a period of growth after a phase of stagnation. However, it is necessary to reach the bottom. And this moment is difficult to predict: "The dimension of the fall will depend on several factors, including the pace of interest reduction in the United States, as well as market aid policies," he was explained.
Based on this trend, the agency admits that a “ice age” is lived: “the real estate market has entered the ice age, with housing prices and the volume of transactions falling,” he was written. "In the second quarter, our estimates point to the volume of transactions of about 200 transactions per month," was planned.
Wake up to reality
Regarding the store lease market, the situation is not much different, and the Centaline indicates that store owners will have to accept the new reality, and possibly undo the stores. "Last year, many of the investors still believed that the drop in income price was due to the pandemic or increased interest rates. They believed that everything was going back to 'normality', so they preferred to pay interest [of mortgages] and keep the bet on their investments," he was explained.
"Recently, they began to realize that the days of good investment in stores have come to an end, the retail sales sector has been transformed and dependence on physical stores has decreased considerably. So the value of stores is gradually decreasing. In holding their investments, they will hardly get good results," he was added.
The centine thus draws a scenario at two speeds. In the most central tourism zones, it admits that there were close to 20 leases where the income value was above 100 thousand patacas. However, in community neighborhoods the situation is very different, especially at the level of stores in Nape or Horta and Costa.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:12:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Economic Housing | Permanent candidacy is again removed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/habitacao-economica-candidatura-permanente-volta-a-ser-afastada/</link><description>With attention focused on competitions for economic housing launched and 2019, 2021 and 2023, the Housing Institute removes the hypothesis allow permanent candidates. Regarding the five suspended housing projects in zone A of the new landfills, the government remains without construction plans
 
The Housing Institute (IH) is concentrated “in the work of appreciation and attribution of applications to Economic Housing of 2019, 2021 and 2023”. As such, it is not being weighted, in the short term, the permanent candidacy for economic housing, since it is necessary to comprehensively consider social changes and other factors, ”said the president of IH, iam Leng Leng, in response to a written interpellation of Nick Law.
The deputy linked to the community of Fujian has insisted on the reform of housing policies, in particular in his flexibility. Nick Law stressed that there is no mechanism in the law that allows the exchange of housing fractions, a situation that penalizes individual candidates who cannot change their home even if over the contest marry or have children. Also on the possibility of changing home, I were Leng Leng has not advanced a concrete position, merely answering that the government will optimize housing policies and that it has launched a study on the viability of the economic housing exchange regime. The deputy asked when the study would be completed and if his results will be released, but the president of IH did not respond.
Good zone
A year ago, the then secretary for transport and public works, Raimundo do Rosario, revealed in the Legislative Assembly that the government would suspend the construction of six residential economic housing complexes in zone A of new landfills, which would add 5,700 apartments to the city's housing park. It should be noted that Raimundo do Rosario revealed the suspension in response to an oral interpellation of Nick Law.
A year later, the deputy re -interrogated the government on construction and development projects. The president of the HI replied that, "taking into account the situation of candidacies for economic housing verified in the last two contests, the Government of MSAR, after evaluation, decided to suspend the development of economic housing projects in lots A13, B13, B14, B15 and B16, and there is no new plans for now."</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:06:30</pubDate></item><item><title>National Security | Government wants to review laws on associations</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/seguranca-nacional-governo-quer-rever-leis-sobre-associacoes/</link><description>The SAM Hou Fai Executive intends to support the development of patriotic associations and review the laws that regulate associative management depending on the requirements inherent in national security. The reforms will follow “the important leading spirit of President XI Jinping”
 
The government will “review and optimize” the laws that regulate associations, in order to improve management and “guide its construction”, “depending on the requirements inherent to the general perspective of national security and the real needs for the social development of Macao”. The commitment to update the legislation related to associative life in Macao to safeguard national security was assumed by the Director of Administration and Public Function (SAFP), NG Wai Han, in response to a written interpelation of Chan U law.
The intention of the Executive of Sam Hou Fai is the promotion of patriotic associativism as an essential pillar of grassroots governance. "The present mandate of the government will support the growing development of associations that love the homeland and Macao in grassroots governance, improve the network of community work, consolidate and expand the adhesion of residents," and "expand public services provided by the Government of Raem to the base social layer." Ng Wai Han also adds that the Executive intends to “coordinate the participation of associations that love the homeland and Macau in community construction and help them to enhance their contributions in the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Hengqin”.
Spirit of love
The SAFP Director also assured that the government intends to “discuss the establishment of the criteria for the quality of social services and the creation of an examination and evaluation system”.
At the interpetement, the deputy linked Federation of Macao Workers' Associations highlighted the importance of national governance at national level. "According to the statements of President Xi Jinping, a country is strong when its bases are strong and the world is safe when its bases are safe."
Given this line of thought, the SAFP director ensures that "the present mandate of the government will expedit the important leading spirit of President XI Jinping, attributing special importance to communication and cooperation with associations that love the homeland and Macao."</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:58:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Álvaro Barbosa, vice-rector of the University of São José: “Student visa is very limiting”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/alvaro-barbosa-vice-reitor-da-universidade-de-sao-jose-visto-de-estudante-e-muito-limitativo/</link><description>The University of São José continues the negotiation saga with the Chinese authorities to recruit students from the interior of China. Vice-rector Álvaro Barbosa expects, soon, the increase in master's students from 30 to 200. Regarding the internationalization of higher education, the official advocates changes in student visas to facilitate recruitment
 
Does the recruitment of students from the interior of China remain a matter pending to the University of Saint Joseph?
It is a process that is underway. We have had huge support from the Macao government in negotiations to obtain the quota for our university, and they have been tireless in the effort to try to resolve the issues raised by the central government. Many of the questions are legitimate and concern concerns that arise. We were granted a temporary quota of 30 students for masters ago over a probative period, which served to evaluate how we, as Western University, would host students from China. From China, there is this concern with the host of students in Macau. I think we have made a huge effort and the students who are there, included in this contingent, are quite satisfied.
Is this quota for masters just?
Yes. For a degree we do not have authorization yet. In this way, we are currently at the time we try to overcome this probative period in order to obtain a quota of about 200 students for masters. We are in the final phase of the evaluation process and everything has been doing well. We will have the possibility that, next academic year, expand this quota. That would be great, because for our university, to have a greater impact of our mission in Macao, it is essential to have access to students from mainland China. We cannot be a university in an integrated region in a country like China, and not contact with students from China.
Is it more difficult for USJ to compete with other universities, such as those of Hong Kong, by foreign students, outside China?
The issue of recruitment of international students has become a priority for Macao universities. In the last two or three years, it has become evident that this internationalization is very important. What difficulty is there? There is the issue related to student visas, as these visas currently do not allow students to do any kind of work, denying them that minimum local subsistence mechanism to be able to meet expenses. Nor is it contemplated the possibility of, when the student concludes his formation, to be in the territory and find work. What all countries and regions that are competitive in higher education do, such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Australia, is to have incentive policies. Allow students to work part -time, for example. In Hong Kong when a degree ends, the student can stay in the territory up to a maximum of two years to find a job. This kind of measures do not yet exist in Macau, but I think the government is pondering this possibility. From the moment the decision was made that the internationalization of higher education was important, this must be accompanied with the corresponding measures. The current student visa is extremely limiting and does not encourage the coming to Macao to study, only allows coming. This issue was not as present as it is now, but now there is a strategic policy of internationalization.
It is also a matter of survival for local universities.
Yes. Perhaps there is no greater example of a catalyst for the diversification of Macau's economy than higher education. We have ten institutions, 60,000 students in about 700,000 inhabitants. This is the potential of internationalization, to foster diversification.

And also the research that comes out of higher education.
The investigation, the dynamics of the work that is done. There are a number of vectors that higher education brings to a region or country, this happened to Portugal, for example, with the policy of doctoral scholarships for students from abroad, which completely changed the dynamics of higher education. Cape Verde developed thanks to the impact of higher education.
Then we need to make the system more flexible in Macau.
I don't know if it's a matter of having a holistic view of strategy. There may be an idea, but then it does not intervene in all the necessary dimensions to achieve a certain goal. But I am very optimistic. I believe this new student policy is a key step to be taken in Macau. The internationalization strategy followed by all these countries and regions I spoke, and were successful in capturing international students, was always the same. No need to invent much. First, one should increase the capacity and notoriety of universities, and then a policy of scholarships, which will enhance a student flow, creating a reference for the territory, so that studying there becomes a habit. After this flow of students for a few years, an image is already created and some scholarships can be removed, which students will continue to choose a particular territory to study in it. Australia has a huge higher education industry, for example, and I think that in Macau we just have to follow the same strategies. We do, at USJ, that a little.
How, in concrete terms?
We offer many scholarships, and in this sense the Diocese of Macao has helped us build this flow of international students that allow us to create this dynamic that we hope will be sustainable by itself in the future. I think the government is also doing this. There have always been scholarships in Macau, attributed mainly by the Macau Foundation, but this measure will be strengthened. Solving the student's visa issue, creating a scholarship incentive system for five to ten years, Macau will have a bright future as an international higher education destination. But we need to invest, continue, and it takes a few years.
USJ created the “Macau Hub” platform, in partnership with the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in 2023. At what stage is this project?
This project has to do with our interest in developing a relationship dynamic of Lusophone countries centered in Lisbon in the area of ​​entrepreneurship, first. This cabinet we have at CCCM is not intended to offer training in Portugal, but we want to do something else. As we are positioned in the Great Bay and with Hengqin, where it is intended to activate a business ecosystem, we want to take advantage of the fact that we have relations with the Lusophone world to activate the access of the startups of Portugal, Brazil and Angola, above all, to the great bay and hengqin. We are trying to create a kind of incubator of transnational companies, in which we support the development of Lusophone businesses that want to settle in the large bay and also the reverse system. Strategically, for a university, it is absolutely fundamental to have a dynamic in the area of ​​entrepreneurship. Currently, more than half of our students do not want to go to the corporate world, but create their own businesses. Just as universities have to have employability solutions, they also have to have them for entrepreneurs, who are increasingly. So a university has to have a business incubator. My vision of the future for higher education goes around: a university, besides having a library and canteen, will also have its own business incubator. I would say that most students of management or economy courses dream of having their own business, especially in China. China is perhaps one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world. The CCCM welcomes this initiative in Portugal, but we also work with the Portuguese Catholic University.
And concrete results, already have it?
We have a number of small initial projects that are starting now, and we also work with many business organizations. We have now negotiated a series of projects, and I think everything will develop very quickly, based on the manifestations of interest we have. We were in Angola in December and we have already aligned a series of initiatives, we also have projects with Brazil and Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:56:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Asian bags fall after collapse of Wall Street</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/economia-bolsas-asiaticas-caem-a-pique-apos-colapso-de-wall-street/</link><description>Asian actions opened yesterday in a heavy fall, following Friday's collapse on Wall Street due to the imposition of tariffs by US President Donald Trump and Beijing's reaction.

With the registration during the extended weekend, the number of entries in Macao since the beginning of the year has exceeded 10 million visitors.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:19:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Architecture | Nuno Soares Proposal for Hac-Sá Beach Wins Prize</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/arquitectura-proposta-de-nuno-soares-para-praia-de-hac-sa-vence-premio/</link><description>“Park of Tides”, a project led by architect Nuno Soares, from the “Urban Pratice” studio, received the Silver Award in the “Landscape Design - Public Landscape” category in the London Design Awards 2024.
The proposal, launched in a public tender by invitation by the Institute for Macao Municipal Affairs in early 2024, aimed to “create an accessible pedestrian route that would connect the two ends of the beach, incorporating simultaneously leisure facilities”, describes the statement.
"Park of Tides" is inspired "in the natural rhythm of the tides", having an area of ​​12 thousand square meters, where it reinterprets "the route with an expansion in the form of wave". In this proposal, it is foreseen “a modern, green and accessible space by the sea, which values ​​the natural beauty and recreational value of Hac Sá beach”.
Nuno Soares also developed three zones, centered on leisure and interactive spaces, exploration of natural materials and outdoor activities and another place with “design and contemporary facilities”. Thus, together, these three zones "reimagine the riverside area as a multifunctional and inclusive destination for visitors to engage, explore and relax."
Cited by the same note, Nuno Soares explained that this project “adopts a minimal impact approach, where permeable structures and natural materials are involved with the terrain”, as well as representing a “commitment” of the studio “with sustainable and inclusive architectural practices, ensuring ecological preservation while increasing the well-being of the community”.
The London Design Awards, together with the International Awards Associate, recognize projects that are exceptional and creative influence proposing to promote works of designers involved in various fields, bringing recognition those who overcome the industry.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:43:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Images about China populated New Show from Halftone</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/imagens-sobre-a-china-povoam-nova-mostra-da-halftone/</link><description>Halftone-Macao Photographic Association inaugurates this Friday a new exhibition dedicated to China's culture and visions. “The Spirit of China” is the name of the show that can be seen on the 3rd floor of The Parisian Macao, in Cotai, from 6.30 pm, being patent until May 11.
This collective exhibition brings together the works of 17 photographers based in Macau, which exploit, through strong visual narratives, the evolution of Chinese identity and its contemporary meaning. Names such as João Palla, Sofia Mota, Sara Augusto or Francisco Ricarte, among others. Some are dedicated exclusively to photography, others just make it a hobby. The idea is to reveal this crossing ways of photographing.
According to a statement from Halftone, which also publishes a photography magazine, “the show proposes a reflection on how fast urbanization and the emergence of megacities coexist with historical neighborhoods, such as religious rituals and old festivities dialogue with digital culture, and how new generations are redefining what it means to be Chinese in the 21st century”.
“With the use of documentary, contemporary and conceptual photography, the works go through time and space-past, present and future imagined-offering deep visions about heritage, urban landmarks and new forms of visual expression,” he adds.
Its own dynamic
Halftone also points out, in the same note, that “more than a representation of Chinese legacy”, this exhibition “reveals identity as a living force - constantly shaped by social, dynamic diaspora and digital interconnectivity”. “The public is invited to reflect on the coexistence between the old and the new, and to get involved with the spirit of a nation in transformation,” is still mentioned.
"The Spirit of China" shows a country that "has undergone an impressive transformation in recent decades, reconfiguring not only its urban horizons and architectural landscapes, but also the very essence of its cultural identity." “Given a rapid modernization and the advancement of technology, a new generation has been building a dynamic dialogue between tradition and innovation,” the note describes.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:40:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | IWO JIMA VISIT IMPERIAL</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/japao-casal-imperial-de-visita-a-iwo-jima/</link><description>The visit of the Japanese emperors serves to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, in a territory that was the scene of one of the most bloody battles of the conflict
 
The emperors of Japan, Naruhito and Masako, yesterday arrived on the island of Iwo Jima, scenario of one of the most bloody battles of World War II, under the 80th anniversary celebrations of the end of the global conflict.
This is the first time that the imperial couple has visited the remote island, now officially designated Ioto, located about 1,250 kilometers south of Tokyo, where they will pay tribute to the war memorials highlighted there.
The Battle of Iwo Jima is considered one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific World War Pacific campaign. During the five weeks that lasted, about 7,000 US soldiers and almost 22,000 Japanese soldiers were killed, among 80,000 soldiers who fought on this island of only 21 square kilometers.
The island take, remote and strongly fortified, on March 26, 1945, was considered a fundamental step in advancing allied forces in the Pacific, in order to invade the main territory of the Japanese archipelago, although the strategic importance of the battle is still debated by the experts.
The island was returned to Japanese sovereignty in 1968 and officially renamed Ioto in 2007, at the request of the area inhabitants, a name actually used by the former inhabitants. The island was wrongly designated by Iwo Jima when the inhabitants were removed shortly before the battle.
After the occupation, the inhabitants were not allowed to return and, during the US occupation, the island maintained that name, which contributed to popularize the caption of Joe Roshental's historical photography, in which US marines are raising the US flag, an adapted image for clint Eastwood.
Other visits
In 1994, emperors Akihito and Michiko visited the island to pay tribute, within the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, marked a year later.
The presence of Naruhito and Masako follows a previous tribute on March 29, starring Japanese Prime Minister Shigero Ishiba, and the Ministers of Defense of Japan and the United States, Gen Nakatani and Pete Hegseth.
The digression of the emperors this year continues in June with a stint in Okinawa, the southernmost island city hall of Japan, where another of the most emblematic battles of this war took place, the battle of Okinawa.
In the coming months, the imperial couple will also visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on the first trip to the cities devastated by US nuclear bombing since they ascended to the throne.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:33:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Lusophone exports to China fall more than 30% until February</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/exportacoes-lusofonas-para-a-china-caem-mais-de-30-ate-fevereiro/</link><description>Exports from Portuguese -speaking countries to China fell 30.7 percent in the first two months of 2025, compared to the same period last year.
According to information from China's customs services, in January and February the Lusophone Block sold goods of $ 17 billion to the Chinese market. According to the data, gathered by the Forum for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and the Portuguese -speaking countries (Macao Forum), this is the lowest value for the first two months of a year since 2021, in the middle of COVID - 19 pandemic.
The descent was due mainly to the largest Lusophone supplier in the Chinese market, Brazil, whose sales fell one third (33.4 percent) to $ 13.7 billion. In addition, also the second largest Chinese commercial partner in the Lusophone block, Angola, saw exports decrease 16.4 percent to $ 2.37 billion. Also the sales of goods from Portugal to China decreased by 13 percent to $ 444.4 million.
On the contrary, the exports of Mozambique rose more than one third (34.4 percent) to $ 332.2 million. Equatorial Guinea exports to the Chinese market dropped 71.2 percent to $ 85.6 million, while Timor-Leste sales shred 98 percent. The exports of Sao Tome and Principe also fell 53.3 percent, although the country did not sell more than 1,000 dollars in goods.
Already Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau did not sell any merchandise to China in the first two months of 2025.
On the other hand
In the opposite direction, Chinese exports to Portuguese -speaking countries also reduced 9 percent to $ 12.2 billion.
The data reveal that Brazil was the largest buyer in the Lusophone block, with imports from China to reach $ 10.3 billion, a drop of 7.8 percent in annual terms. Second on the list comes Portugal, which bought the goods of $ 932.4 million, less than 10.5 percent than in the same period as 2024.
China registered a commercial deficit of $ 4.78 billion with the Lusophone Block in the first two months of 2025.

In imperial examinations, from the Tang dynasty to the Song, between 618 and 1279, the candidates who studied for the imperial exam, after completing it awaited the result on a staircase where the figure of one of these fantastic creatures was carved. What was first, the first to step on the head of Ao, originated a saying to indicate a successful feat-Duzhan aotou, "seize the head of Ao."
The descendants of the emperor, during the Qing Dynasty designated in Manchu A-G, were not subject to this examination, but their study regime was no less demanding. Since three in the morning studying, among others the four books and the five classics, without vacation, with only five days free a year.
One of the most brilliant heirs of this dynasty was Aisin-Tei Hongli, which between 1735-95 would occupy the throne of the dragon son with the name Qianlong. An episode of his biography confirms him when he impressed his powerful grandfather, Emperor Kangxi (1654-1722). He was then twelve years old when he first found him at the Pony Pavilion of the former Yuanmingyuan Summer Palace, the "Garden of the Perfect Brightness." At the time he recited by color the poem of Zhou Dunyi (1017-1073) in praise of the lotto, the flower that is born for beauty, indifferent to the sludge from where it comes.

Usually it also remembered the place by ordering the glorious morning painting during Guxian, the third lunar month (ink and silk color, 179.4 x 106.2 cm, at the National Palace Museum in Taipei).

Observing the fish having fun
gives me a great joy.

I
The old silk routes
Two routes connected the Han Dynasty to the West from the second century BC. The South and North Route, both extended from Chang 'an/XI's to the West, the North through Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, and the South, led to the Mediterranean, Genoa and Venice, Irah and Iraq.  Historically, the old silk route divided into four periods:
From the second century BC to the 6th century, having as high points the diffusion of the Buddhism and emergency of Islam;
2) From the beginning of the seventh century to the late tenth century, the highlight being the diffusion of porcelain;
3) From the eleventh century to the fifteenth century, with the heyday of the diffusion of Islamic and Hindu religions and tax trade in East Asia, the relics of the wreck and 7 trips of Admiral Zheng He (鄭和), between 1405-1431, as well as the emergence of multicultural communities such as Guangzhou, Malaca (Malásia) and Galle (Sri Lanka);
4) mid -century. XV to the nineteenth, with emphasis on the exchange of porcelain goods, peppers and spices, globalization of routes and diffusion of Catholicism, and the predominance of other routes, such as those opened by the Portuguese in the Atlantic to the Pacific, through the Indian Indian, especially the Cape Route. This route started in the 15th and 16th centuries in Lisbon reached India, China and Japan, particularly Nagasaqui, and beyond, Timor, in a project that begins to be outlined by D. João II in 1487, being fulfilled by D. Manuel 1, with the fleet led by Vasco da Gama that would lead to India, near Calecute on May 17, 1498. Farther, Macao, where we established between 1555 and 1557, with scholars, such as Eduardo Kol de Carvalho, who advocate the interesting thesis of ensuring the Route of Japan, opened from 1543 and guaranteed by the Nau do Trato, which made the connection between India and Japan, having elected Macau for the necessary commercial interplay of the Portuguese silk, the territory of this trade Macao in 1557, the base the Portuguese founded on the Chinese coast to support the tract ”(Carvalho, 2018, 77).
For these channels of the old chinese silk routes, silk, lacquer, porcelain and tea arrived in Europe, being transmitted to China glass, gems or precious stones, certain fruits and dry fruits, especially grapes, guavas, cucumbers, as well as other vegetables, for example, garlic and carrots. In addition to agricultural exchanges, also Chinese technological inventions such as gunpowder, the manufacture of paper, impression and compass, or the circulation of ideas and, above all, those that made up religious philosophies. Then, with a sea route of the Portuguese silk, between the 15th and 16th centuries the trade globalized entirely, everything changed and negotiated, transmitted and influenced.
II
The new silk route, including the 21st century sea
If the term “Route of Silk” dates back to the ancient Greek geographers and, in particular, Marinus, already “silk sea route”, is from the twentieth century, an alliance arising in a covenant between the French synologist Édouard Chavannes (1865-1918) and the Japanese with their maritime porcelain trade studies in the 1960s.
The Chinese begin to mention the “sea silk route” in 1974, first with the scholar Jao Tsung-i (饒宗頤, 1917-2018), then explicitly with Chen Yan (陳炎) “Silk Maritime Route” (丝绸之路) from 1980.
The “renewed” version that was born in 2013, announced in Kazakhstan, as a track and route (一带一路) at the initiative of the current Chinese president, XI Jinping (习近平), based on the principle of connectivity, aims to connect Asia, Europe and Africa through land and maritime routes.
The six land corridors well and briefly systematized by Professor Fernanda Ilhéu in “The Last Silk Route that History Knowed and the New Silk Route that History will know” (Ilhéu, 2018: 145) are:
China-Mongolia-Russia;
2) China-Pakistan;
3) China-Bangladesh-India- Myanmar;
4) China-Peninsula of Indochina;
5) New European Earth Bridge;
6) China-Central Western, Central Hands.
They converge all tracks to Europe, Duisburg, Germany, including the sea, of great importance to China, as 90% of Chinese trade is performed by this way. Of course China aims to ensure its sources of energy supply, either oil and natural gas, to which a hub from some central Asian countries, such as Turquemenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Russia, “being China since 2014 the largest world importer” (ibidem).
Also according to data provided by Fernanda Ilhéu, since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, she was preparing her way to become an increasingly international economy, reaching in 2010 the Statute of Second World Economy (Ilhéu, 2018, 147).  The country to maintain this statute, or perhaps even overcome it, needs to continue with its plan of 4 or 5 modernizations, maintaining the connection abroad for this purpose, that is, the Going Out policy has to continue. Thus transit a first phase of globalization, that of direct exports and foreign direct investment abroad (IDEE), for a second phase of globalization, as stressed Ilhéu (2018, 149) in the form of mergers and acquisitions in Asia, Europe and Africa, as well as in the Americas or Oceania.
Then comes a new sea route from the silk that extends from Chongqing to Fuzhou in southern China, passes through Malaca in Malaysia, goes to Mombaça in Kenya (branch to Cape Verde and Santos in Brazil), heads to the Chinese African military base in Djibouti, then to the port of Pyreu in Greece (Ramifications for Madrid and Sines and Brazil), for Venice) Italy and Rotterdam in the Netherlands (branches for Panama and South American countries).
Places related to the silk sea route within China are the coastal regions of Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan and Macao Special Administrative Region, as well as the Huang-Bohai seas, Changjiang River Basin, East China Sea and Taiwan's Strait, Senior China Sea, Japan archipelago, Korea Peninsula, which is the plaque of East Asia.
However, a new sea silk route begins to draw, the polar silk route, which would suppose China, Norway, and Groelândia, into Arctic, to facilitate trade between Asia, Europe and America. The Arctic Route comes out of Shanghai passes through Alaska crosses the North Pole to Denmark to Rotterdão, and from there he can go to the land, passing to China, or using the Rotterdam Silk Route goes to Pyreu, crosses the Suez Channel, Momba, Kolkata (India), Malaca Strait, Jakarta to Zhanjiang (China).
The evolution of the new silk route in the next decade will depend on the growth of the Chinese economy, which according to Thiago Codongo, commercial manager of China Link, will have to grow more than 6% per year to support support and investments, such as the ones they have done in Angola, Venezuela, Pakistan and Mongolia, all these countries with great debts to China.
As Professor Carlos Gaspar (2020) saw in The World of Tomorrow: Contemporary Geopolitics, China performs through the initiative of the Track and Route (Bri) of its various silk corridors, terrestrial, maritime and polar, a strategy of political, economic, cultural and technological connectivity.  Notable advances in mobile telecommunications are distinguished here, such as the 5G network and also in port and rail infrastructure. Moreover, it has the control of Darwin's main marine ports in the Pacific, Hambantotta in Indian, Pyreu in the Mediterranean, Kirkenes in the Arctic, having built in Kazakhstan the dry port of Khorgos, as well as the dry port of Duisburg in Germany.
Note that these routes are essentially commercial and their impact on foreign trade is immense, developing from the purchase and acquisition of ports. Also according to Thiago Codongo, "for China it is also much more interesting to have the maritime control of several seas, lakes and narrows that are important to their goods, both to acquire and to sell." Among these ports are: the aforementioned port of Pireu in Greece (60%); Many African ports among which the largest, the port of Djibouti, close to Ethiopia in Northeast African, built by the Chinese, as well as ports in Ethiopia and Uganda, and in many other African countries, including Guinea, Angola and Mozambique. China has provided help, in terms of construction of concrete infrastructure, to the underprivileged countries, and the building of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia is to be highlighted.  Also about ports, stand out in Brazil, the port of Paranaguá (90%), in the state of Paraná.
According to an investigation by journalist Cecilia Barría, in 2021 were about 115 ports in more than 60 countries, besides having seven of the top ten ports in the world, namely: 1) Shanghai; 2) Ningbo-Zhoushan; 3) Shenzhen; 4) Qingdao; 5) Guangzhou; 6) Tianjin and 7) Hong Kong. According to the latest data provided by Zongyuan Zoe Liu of August 26, 2024, the country has 129 port projects, of which 115 will be active, including ports in which it will have greater or lesser participation, or up to 17 with total or majority possession, the 14 remaining possession will have been suspended or canceled, such as Porto Khalifa in the Arab Emirates.
Also according to the data presented by Zongyuan Zoe Liu, the country is investing in ports with high regular transport connectivity rates, indicated in parenthesis: South Korea (640); Singapore (586); United States (504); Malaysia (486); Japan (423); Vietname (403); United Kingdom (381); Netherlands (380); Hong Kong (376); Belgium (343); India (342); Taiwan (340);  Germany (305), United Arab Emirates (296); Italy (286); Türkiye (283); Thailand (267); France (263); Morocco (263) (https://www.cfr.org/tracker/china-oveseas-ports)
Hit the fear that the Chinese strategy of port acquisition is double, military and commercial, and that in case of widespread conflict, port companies can be used by the Chinese government and, above all, by the popular liberation army marine ships. And examples are exempt: Port of Singapore, of giving Salaam in Tanzania, Pyreu in Greece, Haifa in Israel, Veracruz in Mexico, or Balboa in Panama, the latter near major naval bases.  It is recalled that relatively, for example, to the Panama Canal, the country was present in two ports, Colón and Balboa. Another highly strategic port for China is Freeport in Bahamas, Caraíbe.
There is also another relevant issue, the financial debts of certain countries of fragile economy towards China, some examples to take into account are: Sri Lanka who leased their port for 99 years as compensatory mode of their debt, well -mentioned very indebted countries: Angola, Mongolia, Pakistan and Venezuela.
Among Important Ports in South America, one stands out in Peru, near Lima, the 100% private multipurpose port terminal and detained by Cosco Shipping (China Ocean Shipping Company). It will also refer to the Rio Grande Multipurpose Port in Argentina.
Chinese property in the port sector is mainly in the following companies: 1) Cosco, state; China Merchants, state and 3) Hutchinson Ports, private. In the port control strategy are involved companies such as Cosco (Ports of Pireu and Hamburg) and Shanghai International Port Group (Porto Israelita de Haifa). In Portugal they operate Cosco, through the EuroNave do Porto Maritime Agency, located in Matosinhos and there are also investments related to the Port of Sines, such as the Calb Electric Cars Battery Factory, as well as interest in the expansion of this port.
The memorandum of bilateral understanding celebrated between China and Portugal in 2018, there are 17 agreements, of which the first is relative to the so -called Silk Route, in its terrestrial and maritime aspects, emphasizing in this bilateral cooperation “connectivity” and “electric mobility” 1.
According to Yuan Peng, vice president of the Institute of Contemporary International Relations The New World Order, according to the Chinese view of the world, is characterized by a concentric circle structure, belonging to China three rings: the inner ring of 14 countries with border with China; The intermediate ring of neighboring sea countries, the areas of the East Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Middle East, including Central Asia and Russia, and the outer ring to which Africa, Europe, America and the two poles belong.
The big question is to know if the domain of seas is equivalent to that of the world, which in the space age does not seem to be the case, although China has been rivaling the United States in this domain, and not only in the quality of the second largest economic power, ambitions are equally political wishing to offer a counterpart to a long -dominated unipole.  Nowadays and, above all, in the nundo of tomorrow, as Professor Carlos Gaspar emphasizes, the political ambitions of both Russia and China favor a multipolar geostrategic framework, at least BI or Tripolar, with three great powers in a prominent place: the United States, Russia and China. If these last two powers came into a lasting connection, which does not seem to be the case, there would be an alternative to American power by the Euroasatic axis. However, China needs to consolidate its position as its main Asian power, linking East Asia to South Asia, being currently the main economic partner of asian countries as important as South Korea, Philippines and Thailand, among others.
That China wants to offer itself as a peaceful alternative to the hegemonic power of the United States, there seems to be no doubt, even by the insistent cultivation of a policy of neutrality in the country led by President XI Jinping.
There is yet another important aspect to emphasize: the initiative of track and route (bri) with its maritime and terrestrial links, arises following an internal movement of China in relation to its development and reaction to “a century of humiliation”, the nineteenth of the two wars of opium.
When in the middle of the twentieth century, in 1949, the CCP seized power in China began the first cycle of power of the “New Age”, as Professor Carlos Gaspar2, Mao Zedong's Maoism, was well noted in the unification of the Chinese state, to which the country's second economic flowering cycle was followed by Deng Xiaoping, culminating in the 100th anniversary of the CCP in CCP 2021, the third cycle followed, after 2013, with the rise of President XI Jinping, who seeks to fully realize the goal of erecting China to the category of great power, this possibly widely developed or even completed in 2049 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the arrival of the CCP to power. China's Renaissance as great power and, perhaps, until reunification with Taiwan.
Finally, it remains to be known how we will all be connected, if the good of a new world order and a shared future, if the autocratic command of a dominant power over the rest. Invoking the goodness of intent, I believe we will not attend the emergence of a new imperial power with connections to all corners of the globe, assisted by the misuse of new technologies, but before a connectivity of a network that extends network for economic reasons, respecting the sovereignty of the remaining states, which will avoid internal political interference, practicing a policy of strict neutrality, which They privilege humanity and harmony, as well as other constant virtues: rites, wisdom, trust and justice.

Future markets in the US also closed in red, with S&amp;P 500 lost 4.2 percent, while Dow Jones Industrial Averag fell 3.5 percent. The Nasdaq index lost 5.3 percent.
Tokyo negotiations opened in significant fall, with Nikkei, the main rate of the Japanese scholarship, losing almost 8 percent, shortly after the market opening. One hour later, 7.1 percent was dropped to 31 375.71. The second Japanese index, Topix, also opened to lose 8.64 percent at the beginning of the session.
South Korea Kospi opened to lose 5.5 percent to 2,328.52, while Australia's ASX 200 ASX 200 began negotiations to fall 6.3 percent to 7,184.70.
The Taipé Stock Exchange reference index, Taiex, a few minutes after opening, fell 9.8 percent, losing 2,054 points to 19,243, with the Hon Hai (Foxconn) technology company, the world's largest manufacturer of electronic products, and the giant Taiwanese TSMC, which dominates the world chip foundation market, to also register losses close to 10 percent.
Likewise, oil prices remained a descending plan, with the US oil reference price to fall 4 percent, or $ 2.50, to $ 59.49 per barrel. Brent oil, the international standard, gave $ 2.25 to $ 63.33 per barrel.
The monetary market also registered major movements, with the US dollar to fall to 145.98 Japanese yen from 146.94 yen, and Iene is often seen as a safe port in times of turbulence. The euro rose from $ 1.0962 to $ 1.0967.
Cash recession
On Friday, the worst record since Covid-19, Wall Street closed with S&amp;P 500 to fall 6 percent and the Dow 5.5 percent. The compound nasdaq fell 5.8 percent.
The losses accelerated after China equaled the large increased customs rights announced by Trump last week, climbing the stop in a trade war that could end with a recession of the world economy.
Even a better report than expected about the US labor market, released on Friday, which usually assumes itself as the economic highlight of each month, was not enough to sustain the fall of markets. All actions of the 500 S&amp;P 500 index companies, except 14, fell on Friday.
China's response to American tariffs has caused immediate acceleration of losses in world markets. Beijing's Ministry of Commerce has announced that it will respond to US 34 tariffs imposed by China imports with its own 34 percent rate on imports of all US products from 10 April, among other measures.
The United States and China are the two largest economies in the world. Trump announced on Wednesday that he will impose tariffs on countries around the world. About the rates, the US president said they "will bring growth like never seen" and "faster than you think."
In the case of the EU, Trump said that the fare will be 20 percent, since, he explained, the European Block taxes US products at 39 percent, on average, while South Korea, for example, tributes at almost 50 percent on average. The tariffs imposed by the United States on South Korean products will be 26 percent.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Zhong Kui, the student's patron is often represented on a strange creature that, observed from the tail, has a fish tail that becomes a dragon, a composite designated to.

During Paulo Rangel's visit, it was also announced that Sam Hou Fai should visit Portugal during the summer
 
He met with Sam Hou Fai, with counselors from the Portuguese communities, associative representatives, Portuguese educational institutions and entrepreneurs. Thus was the visit of Paulo Rangel, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, in the short visit to the MSAR, which took place on Friday. There are no passages in the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) and the Consulate General of Portugal in the territory. In the late afternoon, Paulo Rangel also moved to Hong Kong to visit the exhibition “Lusas Stories”, dedicated to the Portuguese community of the territory, patent at the Hong Kong History Museum. In China, Paulo Rangel was present at the Boao Forum in Haião.
In an interview with TDM, the minister assured that Portugal's relations with China remain good, denying that the country's position in the European Union's position (EU) can represent some kind of obstacle.
"Anyone who thinks that Portugal's presence in the EU is harmful to Portugal's relationship with China, does not realize Portugal's relationship with China and does not realize the role of Portugal in the international picture. I realize that some people do not understand, but honestly we have to see it as more value. And this is seen like this," he said.
One of the voices that criticized Portugal's position in relation to stories such as the issue of Huawei and Rede 5G was Amelia António, lawyer and president of the House of Portugal in Macau.
“My expectation is not high. I would like you minister, after visiting China, to say something friendly, as relationships have been very loose. I would like to see this relationship resumed as usual and also that we were not as followers of the EU positions, so fiercely, because we have very special interests and we have a very large Portuguese community. It should not be lost sight of, ”he told Paulo Rangel to Macao.
The EPM question
In the interview given to TDM, Paulo Rangel also commented on the issue of EPM, stressing the points that were not on the agenda, namely the works of expansion of the facilities.
"This question has not yet been addressed. There are, in fact, several issues that have to be detailed and resolved, and one or the other that have not yet been put on the table. We know that there is search for it, but and I am being totally transparent, it is a question that is not yet on the table."
According to Lusa, Paulo Rangel also announced that the government increased financial support to the EPM, returning to the legally expected level after 11 years of cuts.
"We just replaced the Portuguese contribution to the Portuguese School of Macao, which (…) had suffered a huge cut," Rangel said on Friday.
The Portuguese State holds the majority (51 percent) of the capital of the EPM foundation, but since 2014 that Lisbon only contributed with 10 percent of school expenses, a decision taken under the Portuguese financial rescue program. EPM financing “is now at legal levels again and is the first time at the end of 11 years,” he said.
Shortly thereafter, the chief of Portuguese diplomacy told reporters that "there was no reason, honestly, to have this cut and he remained." "We have increased five times this value [of EPM financing], so this is something that is highly significant from the commitment we have."
"There are governments that really give importance to Macau and China and there are others who do not give, this is something that has to be said," lamented the minister, pointing his finger at the previous executive of the Socialist Party. The replacement of financing “is undoubtedly an important help” for EPM, which Rangel described as having a key role for Portugal in Macau.
"We also have pleased ... that there have never been so many Portuguese students - and now I speak of students from the Chinese community - as there are today in multiple schools," added the leader. "It means that also the special administrative region [of Macau] has encouraged Portuguese teaching and knowledge of Portuguese, and this is something that can only bring good relations between the two sides," added Rangel.
SAM in Portugal
From the meeting with Sam Hou Fai, which also took place on Friday, some ideas and opinions on “bilateral exchange and cooperation in the judicial, economic-commercial, education, among others,” says an official note from the Social Communication Office.
Sam Hou Fai led to the meeting topics such as “the most current development of the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Henqing”, and remembered that “Paulo Rangel is the first foreign ministerial guardian he receives after the executive's head of the executive, a fact that reflects the good relations between Macao and Portugal with a longtime history”.
The head of the executive also pointed out that after December 20, 1999, Macau, "with strong support from the central government, has insisted on maintaining the principle of" a country, two systems ", preserving the continental legal system, traditional culture and customs, as well as actively maintaining the connection and foster relations with Portugal."
The ruler also said that "Macao has deepened the role of bridge and platform between China and Lusophone countries, continuously boosting the establishment of friendly relationships in the various areas of bilateral cooperation."
Another novelty of this meeting was the information, advanced by Sam Hou Fai himself, which “expects to visit Portugal in the near future” without, however, a concrete date has been announced.
Rangel announced that the chief executive of Macao is expected to visit Portugal "immediately before August or in September." "There is clearly here also an alignment of the priorities that is highly symbolic," said the diplomat, on the fringes of a meeting with the Portuguese community in Macau.
Asked about the restrictions to Portuguese in accessing the resident status, Rangel said he spoke with Sam Hou Fai "on all the issues that are relevant to the relationship between Portugal and the MSAR." "But, as it is a dialogue that is underway, I have a duty to give the opportunity we can, with the questions that have been raised from one part and the other, now we have space and time to build solutions," he added.
Rangel said that the "follow -up of dialogue" with Sam Hou Fai will take place at a meeting of the Portugal -Raem Joint Commission, "which will be organized in principle in the second semester here in Macao."
Paulo Rangel also said, in an interview with TDM, that the visit of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, president of the Portuguese Republic, “will happen a little later”, precisely due to the marking of new elections in the country. Initially, the aim was that Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa came to Macao in June to commemorate Portugal, Camões and Portuguese communities. The visit should take place in the following months of summer, predicted Paulo Rangel.
Encounters and mismatches
Paulo Rangel also had a meeting with local associative representatives, including with the Portuguese communities counselor. Francisco Mannhão, president of the Macao Retirees, Reformed and Pensioners Association (Apomac), took the opportunity to talk about the bureaucracy that still exists in the relationship with the Caixa Geral de Retirement (CGA).
"To dispatch a survival pension process takes six months and then the correspondence goes back and forth. Macao benches do not have Iban, and this, for example, delays the whole process. Whenever a process goes to CGA, they insist that they do not have the number of IBAN and NIF [Fiscal Identification Number], that most of the widows receiving survival pensions, do not have in Portugal." exemplified.
Mannão also compliments to the Portuguese politician. "For a short time he was here, he showed concern. I liked the presence of the minister." In addition, Francisco Mannão stressed that “in a good time the Portuguese government appointed Alexandre Leitão to Consul”, also recalling the good work of the previous Portuguese consul, Vítor Sereno. "The consulate has never been as well functioned as now. The criticism made to our consul are unfair. There were our associates who told me to have been admired for making a marking and was attended the next day," he said.
More bet on the language
Another important point of Rangel's visit was the promise of the reinforcement of Mandarin teaching in Portugal. "With the Chinese authorities I made a point of saying that we will be very committed to teaching Chinese in Portugal."
In the Chinese capital, Rangel met with Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, before meeting with Chinese vice-minister, Ding Xuexiang, on Hailão Island, where the Boao Forum took place.
"The situation today is much better than it was 20 years ago ... We have, in fact, a formation that we did not have at all," said Paulo Rangel. The formation of fluent people in Mandarin “is also decisive for our future”, but “it is not enough for the challenges we have ahead,” he warned.

The president of the House of Portugal in Macau associates this article with the position of Lisbon in the issue of 5G
 
It is another visit of a Portuguese ruler to Macau, but Paulo Rangel's first as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the executive of Luis Montenegro, at a time when the country is preparing to go to votes in May after the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic.
After a journey through China, Paulo Rangel will meet with local associative leaders in order to perceive existing problems related to the Portuguese community.
At HM, Amelia António, president of the House of Portugal in Macau (CPM), argues that the difficulties of obtaining residence by Portuguese should be one of the pressing matters. “My expectation is not high. I would like the Minister, after visiting China, to say something friendly, as relationships have been very loose. I would like to see this relationship resumed as usual and also that we were not as followers of the positions of the European Union (EU) so fierce, because we have very special interests and we have a very large Portuguese community. of the EU, and this should not be lost sight of. ”
Amelia António highlights the position that Portugal adopted in the case of Rede 5G and Huawei, but also “the development that occurred in relation to the coming of Portuguese to Macau, subject to Blue Card”. “I have the feeling that everything comes following this EU policy against China. Portugal must have a position to safeguard these interests.”
Speaking to Lusa, the official made similar complaints. "We are here, we suffer the consequences of these relationships [between Portugal and China], good or bad. We had very close relations for a long time, which changed with Covid. I have not seen things again as they were, and I think it was important that Mr. Minister explains what is the position," he said that Portugal does not have to "align faithfully with everything in Europe and, above all,"
Before the pandemic, he recalled the official, there was “permanent communication” and “much exchange” between the Portuguese and Chinese authorities.
Today is noticeable a “hardening regarding the Portuguese” in macao immigration, Maria Amelia António declared, but not being able to affirm categorically whether the position is related to “this removal” between China and the West.
Macao authorities have not accepted new requests for residence in the territory for Portuguese for the “exercise of specialized technical functions”, allowing for justification of family reunion or previous connection to the territory.
Also Miguel de Senna Fernandes, lawyer and president of the Macanese Association, regrets the situation of the assignment of the BIR. "I would like the government of the Portuguese Republic to take into account the Portuguese community in the territory, which faces some difficulties regarding the possibility of obtaining the residence. It is a topic that may be addressed between the Portuguese State and the MSAR, to be greater flexibility to allow the Portuguese community to have greater accessibility to the right of residence, as existed before."
For the causal, "Misrere does not have to randomly assign more homes, but it is something that corresponds only to my desire." "Of course, that Mand has its reasons and Macau is different, and there are other communities that are interested in staying in the territory. The Portuguese community, due to greater historical connection that has to the territory, is still another community, among others. As Portuguese we are, we would like to have greater flexibility," he admitted.
The EPM case
Another point that Amelia António and Miguel de Senna Fernandes want to see approached on Paulo Rangel's visit is the situation at the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) and the lack of teachers. "I think you should see the school and make a little more awareness of the situation, although the EPM is not from its area. As a member of the government it is important to realize that this situation has been poorly conducted, because in Portugal has been gone after some conversations that have little to do with reality and only harm. If he realized a little more of the situation, it would not be bad," said Amelia António.
Already Miguel de Senna Fernandes says that it is time for the Portuguese executive to stop looking at the school as another Portuguese educational institution abroad. “EPM is always a recurring question, and it all depends on how the Portuguese state looks at school: if you look like any Portuguese school spread around the world, this is a mistake. There is no possible comparison, because the EPM emerged in a very special context.”
However, to Lusa agency, Jorge Neto Valente, president of the EPM foundation, was categorical: the school “has nothing to peddling” to Paulo Rangel. "There is no whimper, we have nothing to do, we have nothing to demand, everything is normal," he said.
The lawyer and president of the founding of the EPM said Rangel hoped "take a correct perception of the school, what it is for, the goals he has." “It's always good to have direct knowledge, it's much better than in papers,” said Neto Valente. "We have to account that the school is fulfilling the role that is expected to play," added the leader, recalling that the Portuguese State holds the majority of the capital of the EPM foundation.
Still on the EPM universe, Miguel de Senna Fernandes, who also leads the Macanese Instruction Promoting Association (Apim), suggested a close look at the Chinese teaching in the EPM.
"I have always advocated that Cantonese must have status. Because students, when they leave school, are in a singing world. This with all the merit that can have teaching in Mandarin," he said. "It is an issue that should be posed. It is a delicate question, because we are talking about an official language," he added, referring to Mandarin, an official language in China.
The official, also vice president of the EPM foundation, admits that this is not a question that generates consensus -"many parents do not agree with this view" -but stresses that the learning of Cantonese "is a vehicle of integration", as it is the dominant language in the territory.
Yes to the electronic vote
Also to Lusa several associative leaders defended the transition to electronic vote, stressing embarrassment in the current options for emigration. "As long as it is not advanced without being tested, I am fully in agreement. The future is this and we have to point out," said the president of the CPM.
In legislative elections, the Portuguese abroad have the possibility of exercising the right to vote in person or by post, while in presidential and European, the vote is in person.
In choosing correspondence, the government sends the address indicated in the census notebook the voting report and two envelopes, one of green and one white, which must be returned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs after filling.
The electronic option “can offer greater security”, defended Maria Amelia António. "With the consulates to work badly, in order to have few employees, with their work, and in countries where they are far from the places where people live, it is very difficult for people to vote personally. There has also been a lot of failures in the guarantees of receiving vote [via mail]," he added.
The electronic choice is a longstanding claim of the Portuguese Communities Council (CCP). Rui Marcelo, president of the Regional Council of the Portuguese Communities of Asia and Oceania, who has a meeting scheduled with the Portuguese Foreign Minister, said that the “theme is already part of the CCP agenda“ a few years ago and has been approached several times and with several governments ”.
"With the advancement of technology and the possibility of implementing security systems that can ensure vote safety - which happens today through the provision of services in other areas of the government also - the conditions are created so that we can eventually evolve into a situation where it can obviously be a complement, but not a substitute," he noticed.
In February, the Portuguese Parliament approved a resolution proposed by the PSD to test the electronic vote in emigration. The President of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, suggested in December a pilot electronic voting experience in the circles of emigration.
The head of Portuguese diplomacy arrives in Macau today after passing by Beijing and Haikou, in the province of Haião, where he was present at the Boao Forum.
In Macao, Paulo Rangel has scheduled meetings with the head of local government, Sam Hou Fai, as well as the counselors of the Portuguese communities, associative representatives, educational institutions and entrepreneurs. Visit the EPM and the Consulate General of Portugal in the territory.
In the late afternoon, MNE goes to Hong Kong to visit “Lusas Stories”, an exhibition dedicated to the Portuguese community at the Hong Kong History Museum.

Francisco Mannão competes again for president, Jorge Fão for the General Assembly and Daniel Mendonça to the Fiscal Council. Mannão suggests the creation of a “satellite city” only for the elderly and calls for pensions update
 
Increasing the elderly pensions would be "gold on blue." In the meantime, Francisco Mannão continues to fight for this and other flags designed to improve the lives of older residents, again leading the candidate list for the management of Apomac - Macao's retirees, retirees and pensioners association, which take place tomorrow.
The list is unique and the faces have little or nothing difference from previous years: Jorge Fão continues to lead the General Assembly, while Daniel Mendonça competes for the Fiscal Council. There is only one new name in the position of Member of the Fiscal Council.
"It is very difficult to find people available to do this volunteer work. Jorge and I would like to find someone who could replace us, because we are for a long time in this association. We are elderly, but we have energy. As long as we have strength on the legs to walk, we are walking and trying to do our best by Apomac," Francisco Mannhão told HM.
Jorge Fão highlights the fact that Apomac has been about to celebrate 25 years since the foundation, noting that there is, in fact, a leadership problem that if not solved can culminate in the disappearance of the association. "We are not seeing the emergence of another list of younger and younger people, so that we offer our services for another term and so on, as far as possible. There is a leading problem at Apomac and in other associations. The Apomac issue is more serious, because we have been standing for 24 years, we will celebrate in May."
Satellite city and pensions
In a list that will lead the association by 2028, the motto is “we are elderly but energetic”, reads in the action program.
At the first point, it is indicated that the team's objective is "to monitor the government's policy and the Macau Foundation, with a view to adjusting the needs of our action program throughout this three -year term." In addition, they intend to "provide the necessary support to members so that they can enjoy the benefits awarded by the Government of MSAR and other official entities."
One of the requests on the list to the government led by Sam Hou Fai is the increase in pensions, which is currently 3,740 patacas. It would be for the association would be the update to four thousand monthly patacas.
"It would be good for the government of MSar to pay the pension monthly to the elderly, the pecuniary compensation and the old age, instead of having to wait every three months to receive the pension for the elderly, seven months to receive the pecuniary compensation and ten months to receive old age. Hm.
Another idea left by Francisco Mannão is from the construction of a satellite city only for elderly dwellings, in what would be a larger project against residence for the elderly already built by the executive, in the area of ​​sand black.
"I liked the Government of MSA to build a satellite city for the elderly. I worry a lot because there are many living alone, and with the construction of this satellite city they no longer have problems of loneliness, and could live with each other, and can provide services common to all. The construction of high buildings is good, but for the elderly it is not that good," he defended.
Still, Mannão assures that being elderly in Macau is much easier than in Hong Kong. “Nowadays, in Macau, the elderly live quite well, because there are many social support attributed to this group of people.
Sufficient resources
Asked about the essential points to make Apomac a larger association, Francisco Mannhão says that “they have enough”, but lames the closure of the clinic where they were provided to the elderly health care.
"Of course we had the plan to be able to develop our headquarters more, but due to the lack of the allowance we had to end our clinic. In this context, we had a program to develop this area that had to be abandoned, and that would benefit our associates. We tried to organize more lectures about health, because the senior group needs to know more about disease and health affairs, something that can generate great concerns."
In political terms, Francisco Mannhão, who was even a candidate for deputy to the Legislative Assembly, says that Apomac is an advocate of the principle of “one country, two systems”, thought by Beijing to the regions of Macau and Hong Kong. "We agree with the national policy of 'a country, two systems', so that Macau can be a paradise for us. So far we have been quite well in Macau, we have no problems, but we would like this principle to continue."
A lot of bureaucracy
One of the services provided by Apomac goes through bureaucratic support to the elderly in communication with the General Retirement Caixa (CGA), in the case of former civil servants who receive the reform of Portugal, or the Macao Pension Fund.
"The communication with CGA has improved a little, but the bureaucratic part is still very difficult to deal with on the part of our associates. Not long ago one of our associates has waited more than three years for an amount of an amount that was improperly charged," said Francisco Mannão.
Jorge Fão, in turn, stressed that Apomac is also popular with non -partners, including from the Chinese community, to treat various issues, such as requests for subsidies or funeral -related paperwork.
Still looking at the Action program, Apomac's list also aims to “organize more sightseeing tours to mainland China, making known its culture and success of the country”, as well as the promotion of “more coexistence, so that members join periodically”. Much sought after by the dining service, since in Apomac some dishes of macanese gastronomy can be eaten, the list wants to "improve the management of the canteen whenever possible."
Asked if many elderly from Macau want to pass the renovation in China one day, at a time when regional integration is increasingly a reality, Francisco Mannão admits yes, although many “prefer to stay in the territory, as they have their life rooted here, being used to the uses and customs of Macao”. "The Government of MSA has been doing a lot of work so that they can join the great bay," he said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Book | Mark O'Neill tells the history of Europeans in the early days of Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/01/livro-mark-oneill-conta-a-historia-dos-europeus-nos-primordios-de-hong-kong/</link><description>“Europeans in Hong Kong” is the 18th and new book by British writer and journalist Mark O'Neill, who lives in the neighboring region. At HM, he confesses that he began to write the history of the Irish, but the project eventually expanded. As such, it focused on the stories of Europeans who left their brand in Hong Kong, including Portuguese
 
Hong Kong, the city of banking, finance and commerce, a worldwide warehouse for centuries and a gateway to China. It has been the neighboring region throughout the time, since its institution, in 1841. Hong Kong has always been an international territory populated by Europeans of various nationalities, much more than the British who administered the territory until 1997.
It was missing to tell its story, and British author and journalist Mark O'Neill, residing in Hong Kong since the late 1970s, now has it now with “European Europeans in Hong Kong], which even includes a chapter about the Portuguese.
In another work that has just left the newsstands, the author confesses to HM who began to write the history of the Irish in Hong Kong, whose contribution to the "was huge" territory. This work was not published, being born later the idea of ​​doing something bigger.
“I chose the figures that made the greatest contributions, especially at the religious level, or teachers, writers, great figures in the business world and those whose legacies still last,” he confessed.
Mark O'Neill points out that the great contribution of Europeans in the neighboring region took place in the educational area, but not only. "The most lasting contribution was given by schools, universities, hospitals, homes of elderly, social assistance institutions and some companies. Although they are entities that are currently managed, largely, by people from Hong Kong, were founded and fed by Europeans."
The author explains that the most impressive story associated with the legacy of the French arises on the cover of the book. "In the nineteenth century, the French nuns adopted tens of thousands of Chinese girls who had been abandoned and gave them a good life. Without them, girls would have died or worked as child labor, maids or prostitutes," he said.
Another house
Asked about the new perceptions that the book can bring to the general public, Mark O'Neill understands that he is today "familiar with the history of British in Hong Kong, but not with the history of continental Europe."
Thus, the author says he hopes that "the book will help them understand their history, especially their contribution."
In general terms, "in the early decades [of the Hong Kong Foundation], Europeans were, above all, business men and missionaries, both Catholic and Protestants." Then the region grew “as a great Asian city and, from the 1950s, the community expanded.” "Currently, we have architects, engineers, musicians, teachers, restaurant owners, doctors, lawyers, art and people experts in all the domains of life," said the author.
Another prominent figure in “Europeans in Hong Kong” is the Jesuit Hungarian Father Laszlo Ladany, considered the “China's greatest observer in the world for thirty years”, and Anders Nelson, “Swedish singer and long-standing resident in Hong Kong, well known to local inhabitants”, describes the introduction of the work.
“Most people think that Hong Kong was built by the Chinese during their 150 years of British dominance, which is not entirely accurate. As the reader will discover, many of the schools, social assistance institutions, buildings and companies in the city were founded and managed by people from Europe (defined here as 'east of calais'). They forced it, ”is described in the same introduction.
Mark O'Neill also describes that the Hong Kong cemeteries contain traces of this presence, as "Europeans have enjoyed the city and their people more than their homeland." The European presence increased in the neighboring region from 1949, when the People's Republic of China is founded, as "the new Chinese government closed the doors to foreigners, with the exception of a small number of people from other socialist countries." Thus, "eager to remain in China and in the Chinese world, many Europeans have moved from mainland China to Hong Kong," he is mentioned.
The Macaense Legacy
The fourth chapter is entirely dedicated to the Portuguese and Macaense Hong Kong community, regarded as a “pillar of society” for many years. “For 150 years, the Portuguese were, after the British, the largest non-Chinese community in Hong Kong,” reads the work, which draws the profile of five personalities and describes two social clubs where the community was.
Regarding the personalities, the example of José Pedro Braga, the first Portuguese to be part of the Legislative Council, between 1927 and 1937; Sir Roger Lobo, member of the Executive Council between 1967 and 1985; and Commander Arnaldo de Oliveira Sales, first president of the urban council between 1973 and 1981.
"The Portuguese played a key role in the government, in banks, the liberal professions and the commercial companies. They lived here for many generations. Most of the expatriates were only the time of their mission; when they renovated, departed and returned to Britain or another country in Europe. book.
Regarding the origin of this community, it is described as a “mixed race”, or macanese, but also Portuguese with Asian origins. “Its history dates back to hundreds of years, in the early days of Portuguese trade and exploitation. In the 16th century, Portugal established commercial warehouses and religious missions in Goa, Malaca, Macau and Nagasaki. The Portuguese settlers married local women, creating a mixed root population in India, Malaysia, China and Japan. In 1639, the Japanese government expelled all foreigners and foreigners and isolated the country from the rest of the world. ”
Macao emerges closely linked to this community, as it became, in the mid-16th century, “the basis of Portugal in East Asia” after the Dutch blocked Goa and won Malacca.
"The Macanese began to form as a cohesive community-sharing ties with Portugal, the Catholic religion, a common language and kitchen and a feeling of distinction from the Portuguese colonials and their Chinese neighbors. They were the only people in Macao who spoke Portuguese and Cantonese, giving them a role of intermediaries essential for the proper functioning of government and business," he is explained.
The fact that “the Hong Kong foundation has devastated the economy of Macao” made many macanese began to move from weapons and luggage to a much more brightly saving zone. After all, "just 66 kilometers away [Hong Kong] was the best deep water port in southern China within laws, administration and military protection in the largest empire in the world."</description><pubDate>2025-04-01 23:22:33</pubDate></item><item><title>BOAO FORUM | Ia, globalization and sustainability in discussion</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/26/forum-boao-ia-globalizacao-e-sustentabilidade-em-discussao/</link><description>Another edition of the Boao Forum began in Haião, where topics such as artificial intelligence, globalization, current economic issues and sustainable development will be discussed. The head of the Executive of Masters departs today for the event, whose theme is “Asia in the world in transformation: towards a shared future”
 
Posters to announce another edition of the Boao Forum can be seen everywhere in Haião, the Chinese island that hosts the International Forum promoted by Beijing to discuss, with other countries, issues of economic, commercial and cooperation at various levels.
The MSAR will be represented by an official delegation led by Sam Hou Fai, chief executive, who will be on the island between today and tomorrow. Liu Xianfa, commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the MSAR, continues to join the delegation of MSAR as a guest advisor.
The official delegation of the MSAR is also composed by the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP, and the chief executive chief of the cabinet, Chan Kak. During the absence of Sam Hou Fai, the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, will interim the functions of Chief Executive.
The Boa Goveal Forum for Asia 2025 ends on Friday and has as its theme “Asia in the world in transformation: Towards a shared future” [Asia in the Changing World: Tows a Shared Future], and, according to a statement released by the chief executive's office, focuses on four essential areas, one of them “rebuilding confidence and promoting cooperation in a rapid transformation world”.
Objectives are followed by "encouraging growth and rebalanced globalization for inclusive development" or "modeling the future and rapidly implementing the objectives of sustainable development to respond more effectively to global challenges." In turn, the fourth objective concerns a very current area: Artificial Intelligence (AI).
It is thus intended to “explore potentialities and intensify AI's application and governance for development motivated by innovation”.
According to the People's Daily Journal, this year are expected for more than two thousand participants from 60 countries and regions, being held 50 forums, or discussion groups, around the above objectives. 1,140 journalists are expected to coverage the event.
The forecasts of a forum
The main conferences of the Boao Forum include discussions about the Chinese and World Economy, namely in "High-Level dialogue: China's reform and economic predictions" and "construction of an open world economy: challenges and solutions." Following is “Improvement of the construction of digital capacity &amp; conforming the gap between digital”, as well as “unlock the great potential of regional free trade agreements”.
Among the remaining panels are also conversations about the potential of AI in "AI: how to ensure a balance between application and governance." Countries will also address the issue of global governance in the relationship with the United Nations (UN), in "high-level dialogue: global governance after the UN summit of the future."
But the discussion forums start with some predictions made in the report released in the context of the Boao Forum, entitled "Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress". One of the forecasts is that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the Asian continent should grow 4.5 percent this year, reported Xinhua. "Despite growing global economic uncertainty, Asia remains a key growth engine for the world economy," the report says.
In addition, in terms of parity of purchasing power, the Asia GDP ratio, within the world total, is expected to increase from a registration of 48.1 percent last year to 48.6 percent this year. In turn, the report describes that the general situation of employment and wages “is improving in Asia”, with an unemployment rate of 4.39 percent for this year, less than the global rate of 4.96 percent.
The Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress also highlights foreign investments in Asia, describing that China and Asean-Association of Southeast Asia nations "are the most appealing economies in Asia." In addition, it refers that the dependence on the internal and external foreign direct and external investment of Asian economies in the region itself reached 49.15 percent by 2023.
From the point of view of the bidirectional dependence of IDE in Asia, China continued to be the most dependent economy of the Asian IDE flows, followed by Indonesia, with its dependence rates over 80 percent and 75 percent, respectively.
The report also pointed out that China remains the center of global production value chains, and since 2017, global trade in intermediate goods has been more dependent on China than in North America.
In 2023, China's global dependence on intermediate goods was 16 percent compared to 15 percent to North America. The commercial friction caused by the United States in 2018 did not raise their position in the global value chains of the transforming industry, the report added.
Thus, the advance of Asia is also described in the level of emerging green technologies, since this is "driven by strong industrial capabilities and political support." Thus, the continent seems to be positioning itself "as a potential leader in advanced materials related to batteries or production of biodegradable plastics."
China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea dominate the Lithium Battery Battery Technology Global Supply Chain, a factor considered crucial for the electrification of transport, the report underlines. However, China is at the forefront of the expanding green hydrogen industry in Asia, being the region responsible for almost 70 percent of the worldwide capacity of hydrogen electrolisters, also reveals the same report.
An ecological island
According to an Xinhua report, Haião Island, which welcomes the Boao Forum, is “a pioneer in development with low carbon emissions”, namely the use of photovoltaic energy.
"On Dongyu Island, in Hainan province, southern China, the almost null carbon emissions demonstration zone is redefining harmony between humanity and nature-remodeling modern life through the integration of cutting-edge technology with sustainable development," he describes.
But there are more technological news, such as the use of "a simple QR code that unlocks a coffee carbon emissions experience, and where a robotic arm prepares coffee using clean energy." There is also the bet on recycling, as "an advanced recycling cube separates the materials, converting them into" carbon points ", which can be changed to ecological awards."
The area that welcomes the Boao Forum has a total area of ​​190 hectares, where a bet on “three key strategies” was made, namely the “renewal of ecological buildings, use of renewable energy and ecological transport”. The renewal of the zone for more sustainable bets will have begun in 2022, being proof of “how technological innovation and urban renewal can shape a future with low carbon emissions, paving the way for sustainable development, particularly in the tropical regions of the world,” says Xinhua.
Also according to the same report, "one of the main strengths of the area lies in energy production capacity", currently producing "about 32 million kWh of green electricity, almost double its search for 17 million kWh". In turn, "surplus energy is introduced into the network, contributing to an annual savings of 7 720 tons of negative carbon resources," he said to Xinhua Ouyang Qinglun, deputy director of the Cosco Shipping Boao Co. Department of Engineering.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>History | Lara Reis, Professor of Macao High School, remembered in Lisbon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/25/historia-lara-reis-professor-do-liceu-de-macau-recordado-em-lisboa/</link><description>The former teacher of the Macao High School Fernando Lara Reis was remembered in the “Spring Conferences”, from the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center, by historian Celina Veiga de Oliveira. A native of Leiria, Lara Reis fought in the 1st World War and lived on Avenida da República, in the villa that today houses the Macau Red Cross house
 
Fernando Lara Reis was born in 1892 and died in 1950. Throughout a life filled with historical events and testimonies, the natural man of Leiria was a military man and a teacher at Macao High School, eventually making the territory his home.
Lara Reis's life was recently remembered at the “Spring Conferences” of the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) by historian Celina Veiga de Oliveira, herself to her former teacher in the territory.
At the session, the historian, who won the 2024 Macao International Institute Identity Award (IIM), recalled the “teacher, meritorious, driving of the arts”, and owner of “unusual knowledge”.
“He was a native of Leiria and lived in Macao until his death. He attended Leiria High School, the Military College, then joined the Army School. In World War I was in Elvas, and then left to Angola in 1915 when he faced the German threat over Portuguese colonies in Africa. Observer-Aviator. ”
Lara Reis was never a pilot as she wanted, having dedicated much of her life to teaching and Macao. “In 1919, Lara Reis went to Macao High School. He took a long circum-gap trip, leaving Portugal from Lisbon, going to the United States of America, crossed the entire territory and then went to Japan, down to Hong Kong and even Macau. He was a teacher in Macao, drawing, handicrafts and gymnastics until the end of his life,” said Celina Veiga de Oliveira.
The historian took to the session some written testimonies left by other Macao figures who wrote about Lara Reis, namely Monsignor Manuel Teixeira in the book “Macao Lyceu”. He said he never found "no teacher who had served the High School with greater dedication."
“He was a rigorous methodical teacher, whose military formation was certainly not oblivious to these characteristics. What was truly standing out was his artistic vein, because Lara Reis was always concerned with ascertaining the aesthetic meaning of the students and opening their mental horizons. This at the time when Macau was a small town. that he organized and also exhibitions by Portuguese and foreign artists he sponsored, ”he recalled.
Celina Veiga de Oliveira also highlighted the words left by the writer Henrique de Senna Fernandes in an interview on "one of the greatest qualities of Lara Reis", which "besides rigor and discipline, was the consideration by the students, not distinguishing rich from the poor."
Professor Lara Reis was "a party prosecutor who served to obtain tuition fees for needy students," and "he is due to the initiative of the creation of the High School Association, of which he was the first president." This association organized in the former canhydrome “sports parties of the end of the year when students performed the most difficult exercises”.
Work done in Macau
The historian also highlighted “another aspect of dedication to territory” by Lara Reis. The Leiriense "participated in the First World War and this led him to interest all those who were incorporated into this conflict, having founded the League of the Great War fighters and had built in the cemetery of St. Miguel Archangel the monument where the bodies of combatants rest."
Moreover, "another facet of his personality was a taste for travel, because he had no family and thus left for the world." "I visited museums, art schools and photographed everything I saw, having created a estate with 32 volumes that is now a heritage of Leiria."
Celina Veiga de Oliveira did not forget the old “Sol Pente” villa, located in the middle-leaf zone, namely the Avenida da República, which was the house of Lara Reis, later donated to the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Macao to “an anti-cancer clinic that was the first institution of the genre in the Portuguese colonial space”. Today this villa serves as a house to the Red Cross of Macao, and on its walls you can find a stone with the following message: “In this building legacy by the Rotary Fernando Reis to the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Macao, it was installed at the initiative of the Rotary Club of Macao the first anti-cancer fighting center on April 15, 1951.”
“Change of Ares”
When Fernando Lara Reis goes to Macao, political times are troubled, with the political agitation to be lived in China after the fall of the Empire and the Republican Revolution of 1911.
"In the 1920s the nationalist shock waves lived in the Canton, which sometimes haunted the Portuguese enclave quiet, but never moved with everyday life. The Portuguese administration guaranteed a standard appearance, and the parties at Christmas, Chinese New Year, the religious festivities of the Catholic community and the Chinese population were habitual."
Celina Veiga de Oliveira recalled that in the late 1920s, Lara Reis decided to transfer to Goa, a trip that would only accentuate her belonging to Macau.
“In the late 1920s, he felt he was time to change his air and asked to be transferred to the Afonso de Albuquerque High School in Pangim, and was there between 1941 and 1945, taking the opportunity to know India, and met the whole country. Instead, with a graceful and already sick license, choosing Macau to be his last address, ”he recalled.
Celina Veiga de Oliveira recordou também as palavras de Orlando Cardoso, que no artigo “Macau e o Oriente na vida de Lara Reis” falou do homem que se deslumbrou com Macau “a partir do momento em que, às 8 horas da noite de 23 de Outubro de 1919, avistou pela primeira vez o Farol da Guia, um pouco antes de se instalar no ‘New Macao Hotel’ e sorver de sentidos atentos os sons, os cheiros e as luzes desta porta of an immeasurable and fantastic Asia that he would describe to exhaustion. ”
These Lara Reis testimonies are “in a remarkable set of travel books that lay virtually unexplored in all their research potentialities on the shelves of the Leiria District Archive”, and were investigated by Orlando Cardoso himself.
In the same article, this one refers to a text from the newspaper “News of Macau” of January 17, 1950, about Lara Kings: “The Auster and Worsen Teacher; the tenacious and thorough tourist; the military who fought and consecrated the memory of those who fell in the field of struggle; the honest and firm friend; the lovely and humorous companion; social celibate that, despite this, did not disdain any opportunity to undo its gallants, always kind and inconsequential to any palm with a face that in the goto ”.
Given the few studies that exist about Lara Reis and the estate he left, Celina Veiga de Oliveira left a suggestion: "May the CCCM get the detailed index of the Leiria Archive, so that the research is possible for any interested researchers."</description><pubDate>2025-03-25 00:57:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Public Hiring | New regime “is on the good way,” says lawyer</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/24/contratacao-publica-novo-regime-esta-no-bom-caminho-diz-advogado/</link><description>Marco Caldeira, a lawyer and auxiliary teacher at the University of Lisbon Faculty of Law, argues that the proposed public hiring law, under analysis in the specialty in Hemiciclo, is “on the good way” regarding the attempt to “promote transparency and competition and bet on digitization”. The theme was discussed last week at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center
 
The proposal of public hiring, currently under analysis in the specialty in the First Permanent Commission of the Legislative Assembly (AL), was one of the topics addressed in the “Spring Conferences”, at the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) last week. The author of the lecture, the lawyer and teacher Marco Caldeira, made praise for the diploma for his attempt to reform and innovation in many respects.
"Although not perfect, the bill under discussion is justified by the need to update legislation that was approved four decades ago. It is a proposal that seems to point in the good way, with an effort to codify the regime, promote transparency and competition and bet on digitization," said the professor at the University of Lisbon Law School (FDUL) to HM.
In addition, Marco Caldeira understands that the diploma, and the content proposed by the government, aims to "follow what are good practices adopted in Europe and the West in general."
"It is also very commendable that the proposal was prepared following a serious and participated procedure of public consultation, which gave the opportunity to economic operators and contracting entities to identify deficiencies in current legislation and make suggestions," added Marco Caldeira.
At the CCCM session, the FDUL professor also pointed out that the concern [demonstrated, in the diploma] with the competition and transparency of the procedures ”, as well as“ the focus on training in the use of databases, as well as the focus on centralization ”.
The teacher also understood that, in this bill, the Portuguese regime "can help, because the practice followed in Portugal, and legislative evolutions, have useful teachings that, with proper adaptations, can be transposed to Macao."
Positive points
In the presentation at CCCM, Marco Caldeira highlighted several positive aspects of the current law proposal, namely “the express determination of inapplicability to certain contracts”, or the fact that “fundamental principles of public hiring” are established.
It is also required with the new law “qualifications to candidates and competitors” of public tenders, and there is also “the clarification and standardization of the types of public hiring procedures”.
Thus, a “centralized hiring regime” is created, as well as regulating “award criteria” in competitions, and the creation of an exclusive website for the public hiring area is also foreseen.
Marco Caldeira also drew attention to the real need of this diploma, as public hiring was legislated with various diplomas, including two decrees of 1984 and 1985, which established, respectively, the expenditure regime with works and service acquisitions, and the process of acquisition of goods and services. Such diplomas were “undone of reality” of Macao, even though the 1984 decree was reviewed in 2021, the teacher considered.
Marco Caldeira also considered that the process of reviewing this diploma has been “lengthy”, as the public consultation took place between November 6, 2018 and January 4, 2019, and a later report was prepared, but the truth is that the proposal has been under analysis since December 2023, having been voted generally on January 11 last year.
What has to change
In the same session, the causal and university professor also highlighted the points already addressed by the first Standing Commission of AL regarding the necessary changes to legislate in the area of ​​public hiring. It was imposed “expressly consecrating fundamental legal principles, such as economy, efficiency and effectiveness, as well as publicity and transparency”, and there is also “a lack of regulation of public hiring policies”.
There was also the “need to promote transparency in public hiring procedures” and ensure “greater protection of loyal competition”. There was also “lack of rigorous and explicit regulation on the composition and operation of the proposals evaluation committees” submitted to a public tender, and there is “lack of explicit demands on the qualifications and capabilities of candidates and competitors in hiring procedures”.
Other gaps point to “insufficient regulation and transparency in the evaluation and adjudication procedures”, or “lack of explicit regulation on proposals presentation with an abnormally low price”. It was still necessary to “improve the sanctioning and inspection regime”, as well as bet on “regulation that promotes the development of electronic hiring”.
Says the executive
Looking at the justification of the law proposal, submitted by the Executive to AL, it is read that one of the great reasons for his presentation was even the legislative dispersion that was verified and the misfit over the current reality.
"The nuclear part of these diplomas was prepared in the mid-1980s, and has been in force for over 30 years. A significant part of the provisions of other legal diplomas already has an obvious divergence regarding the needs of Macao's current socioeconomic development, the efficiency of public administration management and the reinforcement of transparency and supervision," he reads.
According to the executive, "given that public hiring involves the use of the public purse, it is essential to review these regimes in order to meet the needs of the society of our day." Thus, in this law proposal, “the process and regime of expenses and acquisitions of goods and services” are regulated, with some provisions of a 1999 law, as “the provisions related to the public works contract regime have a high degree of specialization and are still effective”.
It is intended, with the new law of public hiring, to “guarantee justice, impartiality in the evaluation of proposals”, defining “expressly aid criteria and rigorously determining the rules of conduct of workers and members of the opening and evaluation of proposals” subjected to contest, so that “excerpt their functions impartially and entirely”.
Thus, it is foreseen that “contracting entities must adequately publicize the informative elements related to public hiring procedures”. They are “those related to the public tender, the clarifications provided, the rectification of documents, the extension of the deadline for the presentation of proposals, the causes for non -adjudication, the decision to annul the procedure and the award decision”.
In order to guarantee loyal competition, the government wants to ensure that all entities interested in participating in a competition have “the broader access” to all procedures, prohibiting “all acts, agreements or practices that can prevent, false or restrict competition”. Moreover, there is the “principle of impartiality”, which determines that “the program of procedures, book of charges or other documents, made by the contracting party, cannot contain any clause designed to favor or harm a particular interested party”.</description><pubDate>2025-03-24 02:18:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Road Works | Au Kam San criticizes administration</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/obras-viarias-au-kam-san-critica-funcionamento-da-administracao/</link><description>Former Deputy Au Kam San criticizes the bureaucracy of the working group for the optimization of the Coordination of Road Works, launched by the Chief Executive.
In a Facebook publication, Au Kam San understands that the creation of this public organism will not solve the problem of road works, having described that, despite this new group being led by the secretary for transport and public works, Raymond Tam, maintains the same ideas as the previous executive.
In addition, the former deputy recalled the creation of another similar entity, the road works supervision group. "The joke that can be associated with this bureaucratic system is that if a group cannot do a job well, there will be another. If this work remains not done, there will always be another group and added service," he wrote. Au Kam San concluded that the problem of road works has existed since the establishment of MSAR, so it does not believe that it can be resolved through “improvements” and “coordination” with working groups.
However, the second meeting of the working group was held yesterday to optimize the Coordination of Road Works, and Raymond also said, according to an official note, that “the government will require the promoter to reserve the spaces for the installation of channeling during the execution of the works, with a view to reducing the possibility of repeated excavations on public roads”.
"Instructions for members of the working group and channeling companies were given to reduce the deadline for execution of works and apply more technology in order to minimize the impact on residents and retailers."</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:09:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Tobacco | Residents want clarification of smokers zones</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/tabaco-moradores-querem-clarificacao-de-zonas-para-fumadores/</link><description>The General Union of Macao Residents Associations (Ugamm) argues that the government should more visibly demarcate the zones for smokers, removing them from the areas of the highest affluence of tourists. The position was taken by Che Mei Leng, vice president of Ugamm, in statements to the newspaper Exmooo.
In a reaction to government plans to create a smoking zone near the ruins of Sao Paulo, Che indicates that it is necessary to keep in mind that smoke tends to spread and therefore should be avoided by affecting the other tourists, residents and traders of the zone. The official asks the area to be created far from the large concentrations of visitors.
However, residents' deputy also recognizes that it is natural that smokers do not want the area to be far away from the main attractions. For this reason, Che Mei Leng considers that the government has to find a balance between the benefits for the residents of the zone and the interests of smokers.
Che Mei Leng also suggested that a transitional period be implemented before punishments are applied so that tourists can be well informed about the consequences of their acts. At the same time, Che called the government to promote the dissemination of the measure on social networks.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:07:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Economic Housing | Permanent candidacy is again removed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/habitacao-economica-candidatura-permanente-volta-a-ser-afastada/</link><description>With attention focused on competitions for economic housing launched and 2019, 2021 and 2023, the Housing Institute removes the hypothesis allow permanent candidates.

The Housing Institute (IH) is concentrated “in the work of appreciation and attribution of applications to Economic Housing of 2019, 2021 and 2023”. As such, it is not being weighted, in the short term, the permanent candidacy for economic housing, since it is necessary to comprehensively consider social changes and other factors, ”said the president of IH, iam Leng Leng, in response to a written interpellation of Nick Law.
The deputy linked to the community of Fujian has insisted on the reform of housing policies, in particular in his flexibility. Nick Law stressed that there is no mechanism in the law that allows the exchange of housing fractions, a situation that penalizes individual candidates who cannot change their home even if over the contest marry or have children. Also on the possibility of changing home, I were Leng Leng has not advanced a concrete position, merely answering that the government will optimize housing policies and that it has launched a study on the viability of the economic housing exchange regime. The deputy asked when the study would be completed and if his results will be released, but the president of IH did not respond.
Good zone
A year ago, the then secretary for transport and public works, Raimundo do Rosario, revealed in the Legislative Assembly that the government would suspend the construction of six residential economic housing complexes in zone A of new landfills, which would add 5,700 apartments to the city's housing park.

The reforms will follow “the important leading spirit of President XI Jinping”
 
The government will “review and optimize” the laws that regulate associations, in order to improve management and “guide its construction”, “depending on the requirements inherent to the general perspective of national security and the real needs for the social development of Macao”. The commitment to update the legislation related to associative life in Macao to safeguard national security was assumed by the Director of Administration and Public Function (SAFP), NG Wai Han, in response to a written interpelation of Chan U law.
The intention of the Executive of Sam Hou Fai is the promotion of patriotic associativism as an essential pillar of grassroots governance. "The present mandate of the government will support the growing development of associations that love the homeland and Macao in grassroots governance, improve the network of community work, consolidate and expand the adhesion of residents," and "expand public services provided by the Government of Raem to the base social layer." Ng Wai Han also adds that the Executive intends to “coordinate the participation of associations that love the homeland and Macau in community construction and help them to enhance their contributions in the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Hengqin”.
Spirit of love
The SAFP Director also assured that the government intends to “discuss the establishment of the criteria for the quality of social services and the creation of an examination and evaluation system”.
At the interpetement, the deputy linked Federation of Macao Workers' Associations highlighted the importance of national governance at national level. "According to the statements of President Xi Jinping, a country is strong when its bases are strong and the world is safe when its bases are safe."
Given this line of thought, the SAFP director ensures that "the present mandate of the government will expedit the important leading spirit of President XI Jinping, attributing special importance to communication and cooperation with associations that love the homeland and Macao."</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:58:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Employment | Criticized bet on leavers from outside without experience</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/emprego-criticada-aposta-em-licenciados-de-fora-sem-experiencia/</link><description>Deputy Ron Lam accuses the government from having diverted the political intention of allowing local companies to hire non-residents with international experience and success, and instead be issuing residence permitted to young people without curriculum.
 
Legislator Ron Lam attacked the government's policy of allowing imports as “talents” of non -residents with academic education, but without any professional experience. Criticism arises in a written interpellation, where the member of the Legislative Assembly indicates that politics is inconsistent, since one is through a phase in which the unemployment of newly educated is becoming worse and worse.
In the document released yesterday, Lam requires the government to end with the new status to authorize the residence of newly graduates with high notes, but without any professional experience.
From the perspective of the deputy, these permits of setting residence in Macao contradicts the policies presented by the government, and which were approved in the Legislative Assembly, which aimed to import qualified labor from abroad extremely successful professionally in their areas of activity.
While hiring abroad, the deputy indicates that young licenses cross a very complicated phase of entry into the labor market, and that people from Macao who have graduated abroad also find a job market with many challenges, with difficulties to find a long -term job.
In this context, the deputy asks the Executive whether the regime will eliminate the hiring of non-residents without professional experience.
The reality of numbers
Regarding the problem of unemployment among the younger ones, the deputy cites last year's official statistics to indicate that 47.1 percent of local unemployed were at least one degree. And among the unemployed with training in higher education, 28.1 percent was between 25 and 34 years old.
"The numbers show that compared to 2019, the situation of unemployment is more serious. Many young people and middle-aged people who have academic education at higher education have told us that it is increasingly difficult to find a job and that companies only want non-resident workers," Ron Lam describes.
The deputy also writes that the various employment fairs organized by the Directorate of Services for Laboral Affairs offer little attractive jobs, and that in many cases job vacancies are “false”, not leading to hiring.
Lam also criticizes the way unemployment statistics are compiled, indicating that there are discrepancies between the different published data, which in theory should be similar. The deputy asks the government to correct this problem as soon as possible to be able to take employment measures according to the reality of the local market.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 01:18:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/academia-internacional-de-hong-kong-contra-a-corrupcao-ii/</link><description>Last week, we debated the Independent Commission Against Corruption of Hong Kong (HKICAC) (Hong Kong Against Corruption Committee) and Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption (HKIAAC) (HGO KONG ACADEMY AGAINST CORRUPTION) and we introduced their origins succinctly. Macao Commissioner against Corruption, (CCAC).
In 1975, during the Portuguese administration of Macao, the fight against corruption was carried out by the Judicial Police. In 1992, the then government of Macao created the High Commissioner against corruption and administrative illegality. Referring to Hong Kong's experience, which had become one of the most impollowing places in the world, when writing Macau's Basic Law, it was clearly stipulated that CCAC would have to be created.
The CCAC website underlines the committed work it develops to review the law and strengthen the fight against corruption. One of the most illustrative cases is that of Man Long:
“Investigating the case of corruption A to Man Long began in 2005, when during the investigation of a corruption case based on information available in the meantime, CCAC found that the then secretary for transport and public works was involved in suspicion of abuse of power. He will have accepted bribes of large construction entrepreneurs and the winners of major government works are indicated.”
(In April 2007, the first phase of the inquiry against Man Long was completed. It was found that, during the time of the secretary, his heritage reached a total of 800 million patacas, ie, 57 times higher than the remuneration of the position. Objects. On January 30, Tui ordered Man Long for 57 crimes of passive corruption, whitening, abuse of power and others, to the prison penalty of 27 years and the payment of compensation of 240,000 Patacas to the Government of the Government, being declared in favor of the government all assets from illicit acts.).
This shows that CCAC has achieved extraordinary results in its work to combat corruption.
In 2006, the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities (Iaaca) was created in Beijing. It is the first international anti-corruption organization in the world with agencies from various member countries. It aims to actively promote the “United Nations Convention against Corruption” and reinforce international cooperation between counterparts from various countries. Cao Jianming, Attorney General of China's Supreme Popular Attorney's Office, was elected president of IAACA twice, on November 5, 2010 and November 24, 2013. The mandate of the IAACA President is three years. On January 5, 2022, the Commission Commission Commission against Hong Kong Corruption, Ba Yunliu, was elected as a new president. Later, Ba Yunliu retired. On September 1, 2023, Hu Yingming assumed the position of president of IAACA.
IAACA has a “Federation Secretariat”, created by HKICAC on January 6, 2022 to support the HKICAC Commissioner in the exercise of his duties as president of IAACA. The main responsibility of the Federation Secretariat is to support or organize activities. HKIAAC is affiliated with the HKICAC International Cooperation and Institutional Affairs Division and performs part of the federation secretariat's duties.
Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee believes that, in addition to cooperating with China's work and anti-corruption policies, HKICAC also cooperates with organizations around the world to jointly promote the global anti-corruption cause. HKICAC can help improve the fight against corruption in Hong Kong, promote the region's unpolluted environment and promote the stability, integrity and rule of law of Hong Kong society.
Currently, HKICAC has already trained in over 70 countries. In February 2024, HKICAC coorganized a “International Anti-Corruption Course on Financial Investigation and Pursuit of Fugitives and Stolen Assets”, lasting nine days, in collaboration with the “Operational Network of Agencies for the Anti-Corruption Law of the United Nations Drug and Crime Law”.
In March 2024, HKICAC opened a five-day anti-corruption course for more than 90 employees from the “illegal enrichment office” in Mali, covering topics such as research techniques, integrity management and public education. In early April 2024, HKICAC sent staff to Kazakhstan in Central Asia to conduct courses to nearly 200 local anti-corruption agencies.
In May 2024, HKICAC signed a memo of cooperation with the United Nations and Crime Operational Network of Application Agencies. In May 2025, it assisted it in the writing of the “Prison Corruption Risk Management Guidelines”.
A HKICAC spokesman pointed out: “HKICAC values ​​operability that combines theory with practice, actively fulfills its anti-corruption mission, builds an international platform for integrity, promotes the development of the anti-corruption cause globally, and unequivocally contributing to its advancement worldwide.”
HKICAC has provided several anti-corruption formations in many countries and worked hard to combat global corruption. These achievements were made under the leadership of China. From now on, HKICAC will not only continue to compete with this work, but its existence will speak for the history of China and Hong Kong.

It is an inquiry carried out by companies created to inquire with people something that is intended to have a widespread idea. Well, widespread is never possible.
Because most political polls are a bullshit. There are the most varied types of polls: commissioned by political parties, television channels and radio, newspapers and some simply by economic groups. Political polls in Portugal have been a crushing crush on the end result of elections. There was a year, where all the polls held with the respondents gave victory to the Socialist Party and who won the elections was the PSD. And the opposite has already happened.
The polls that have been released lately, in relation to the next early legislative elections and marked on May 18, have left the majority of the disoriented population. And why? Now, because the polls are a bullshit. Some polls have been carried out - in a population of millions of people - along with 500, 800 or 1000 people, with the aggravation of contacts to be made for fixed phones numbers.
And who has a landline today? A few old men and a little more. Now, a poll of this genre, incredibly commissioned by a television station, another radio and a daily newspaper, has any credibility? It does not have, but influences the electorate potential. And here is the Busis of the question. There are polls that only aim at the mental influence of voters.
There are polls for all tastes. It is even shameful. Certain polls we know that they are paid to birth for a certain political party and always present this party ahead. It is total manipulation. We have had other polls that are the total disparity.
Some give victory to the PSD-CDS coalition for six points ahead of the Socialist Party. Others present the PS victory with three percentage points about the PSD-CDS. There are polls that give up 12.3 percent while others provide a result to 18.5 percent populists. Obviously something is wrong. Even the Catholic University that always had the greatest credibility with the Portuguese regarding polls, so that this time did not miss, presents a technical draw between the PS and PSD-CDS. Most polls are manipulative of the voter's future vote.
The numerical difference between the different surveys, shows that it does not hit the boot with Perdigota. We remember perfectly what happened in the 2022 elections, when the socialists won the absolute majority with all the polls to give the PSD the victory? The PS turned out to be 5.5 percent than what the polls predicted and the PSD had 5.5 percent. The polls were manipulated to scare people and lead them to vote in a certain way.
The PS would never have had an absolute majority, if surveys such as intercampus and not only, they would not talk to a technical draw and a Taco-Taco between PS and PSD, which simply did not exist. A colossal error, a clamorous disadvantage between polls and what happened in reality, or results from a festival of incompetence, or it was a criminal strategy of general electorate manipulation, read a colossal scam. In the first case these surveys should never be hired again, in the second there would have to be license losses.
And in both cases, we suggest that one will end up with the dissemination of polls in both pre, in the middle of the election campaign. It is right in sight of all what is going on to the elections of May 18. Some poll companies are even manipulating the electorate, including the number of undecided. Some polls opine that there are still 18 percent of indecisions, others say the undecided are around 3 or 4 percent.
It is more than proven that in most cases we are facing bullshit polls. Because they manipulate, lie and obey those who order. On the other hand, we have party leaders who laugh at the results of some polls. It is well known that political parties order polls only for internal analysis. And in certain cases, there are parties that have well -held polls and with a vast number of respondents and know that the intention of the Portuguese vote is absolutely contrary to what is being disclosed by certain television channels and certain newspapers.
However, the Monarchical Popular Party, which was removed from AD, contested the name Democratic Alliance (AD) to continue to appear in the voting bulletins for May 18. And the court gave it reason and the PSD and the CDs were forbidden to use the acronym democratic alliance.
But, as in politics village is a constant, so the PSD and CDS leaders invented a maneuver, so that the Constitutional Court could not fail. And presented the denomination “AD-College PSD-CDS”. Okay, won the cleverness Saloia. It is that there are many more monarchical than voters in Portugal in Portugal. Even so, the PPM has already appealed in court to support that it is illegal to maintain the acronym AD.
This election campaign will be hard. Luís Montenegro will be confronted with all the cambalachians that are responsible for him. Pedro Nuno Santos will not be saved from being accused of inventing three airports to Lisbon overnight and having harmed the country with everything that happened in TAP. And André Ventura? Well, this one is losing voters in each passing month and today says one thing and tomorrow another. The credibility of yours arrives is gradually lowering, because you have not missed the cases and houses, such as deputy that stole bags, another that is suspected of pedophilia and so many other facts that have taken potential voters for other stops.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 02:00:04</pubDate></item><item><title>The Trump Administration and the sustainability of the globe</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/02/a-administracao-trump-e-a-sustentabilidade-do-globo/</link><description>The relatively short period since the Trump administration has taken power in the US has already seen that the next four years will be continued the attack on common sense, among other aspects, regarding the sustainability of our planet. Instead of following the recommendations of several specialized UN agencies, based on scientific studies, more measures will occur in order to increase the exploitation of fossil fuels.
Trump decreed, for the second time, on the first day of his second term, the departure of the Paris Agreement. And it made it provocatively before the television chambers. In addition to the withdrawal of other UN institutions, such as the World Health Organization and the Human Rights Committee, its administration is taking steps to suffocate projects in areas related to the environment. Other symptoms of Trump's aversion to science are the fact that it is taken to resort to expressions such as “climate change” and “global warming”, in documents from US state agencies dealing with the atmosphere, oceans and climate.
Also other institutions, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department and the Energy Department were notified in the same direction. These are not purely semantic measures, but very concrete instructions to try to reverse the struggle that is waging on the global scale against the use and abuse of fossil fuels, which, as is well known, are the main cause of the greenhouse effect that is based on climate change. This government behavior of the most powerful power of the globe, and the second that most injects greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere, configures what should be classified as a crime not only against humanity, but also against biodiversity, the environment and sustainability of our planet.
The explanation of this attitude can be found when investigating the main supporters of Trump, among whom are not only the rural voters of the rural world, easily manipulable through social networks, but also personalities of high finance and tycoons involved in the exploration of fossil fuels.
These have a lot to profit from this policy, such as the intrepid Elon Musk, one of the leading funders of the election campaign that preceded the seizure of power by a thirsty oligarchy of easy profit. It is still in our memory the promise of offering a million dollars to some of the voters who signed a petition to support candidate Donald Trump.  The favors pay themselves with favors, and there is Trump, recently, to advertise Tesla cars.
It is likely that the intensification of fossil fuel exploitation, advocated by the new American administration, will help to temporarily counteract the climb of energy price, as the energy transition advocated by the wide range of the United Nations is relatively expensive for citizens.
However, renewable energies are becoming increasingly economical and competitive, which implies, in the medium and long term, which prices decrease significantly, given the main sources of renewable energy (solar radiation, wind, water resources, waves and tides, biomass, geothermism) are unenforceable.
In addition to oligarchs and citizens with relatively low level of instruction, they also contributed to this situation of the dark conspiracy theory promoted by the Qanon1 movement that, through the internet, develops activities based on false news, the famous fake news. It is also reported that the Russian Federation is not oblivious to the maneuvers that brought Trump to power, as happened in 2016, using cyber attacks that impaired candidate Hillary Clinton.
All of this takes place at a time when our planet walks dangerously to a critical point where it will be increasingly difficult to reverse the damage caused to the various components of the climate system: the atmosphere is increasingly impregnated with gee; In the hydrosphere, acidity and pollution of the oceans increases dangerously; In the biosphere forests are decimated by fire and deforestation, and biodiversity undergoes accelerated degradation; In the lithosphere, soil is partially impregnated with toxic products, including heavy metals from human activities, which are likely to be absorbed by plants and enter the food chain of animals and humans; Criosfera partially fuses dangerously causing increased average sea level.
According to the World Meteorological Organization and the world glaciers service service, in the period 2022-2024, the greatest loss of glacier never registered in three years, and in many regions the glaciers will not be able to last beyond the 21st century.
It is disappointing that a set of oligarchs, which only has short -term profit, is contributing to drag our planet to increasingly difficult times. The invoice to pay will be the more serious the longer this administration, and similar ones, are in power.
Instead of the recent provocative visit of the US Vice President to Gronelândia, it may have been a better idea to have visited Iceland, where there is a sign where there was the "Okjökull" glacier (also called "OK"), the first Icelandic glacier to disappear due to climate change.
It is written in it in Island and English, with the title “A Letter to the Future” in the following: “Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as glacier. It is estimated that in the next 200 years, all our glaciers follow the same way. This monument is to make known that we know what is happening and what is needed to be done.

Qanon-Far-right movement emerged on the Internet in 1917, which often resorts to false news that fosters the belief that there is a secret conspiracy on the global scale fostered by elites, politicians and figures of the intellectual and artistic medium that would be involved in activities related to pedophilia, trafficking in children and satanic rituals.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:23:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Order and Chaos do not exist</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/02/a-ordem-e-o-caos-nao-existem/</link><description>"Chaos is the domain of ignorance, the Unexplore. Order, on the other hand, is Like an Explored Territory, It's the Hierarchy, The Organization, The Environment of Master, in Which You Know and Understand."
Jordan Peterson
There are interpretations. Often instrumental. My order is your chaos and vice versa. Conflicts between and within human groups have to do with the unequal distribution of order and disorder. It's never great. The result is permanent instability as long as there is life on Earth. The opposite is also true because the war to end all wars is the war to end the world. And our species. Since, however, inspired by Elon Musk, we have not implemented in other planets.
Until the mid -twentieth century, these were speculation in the service of modern idolatrias who postulated the possibility of the impossible and refreed the implementation of the possible. Never definitely limited. From Hiroshima, we know that there is no limit to our fighting and self-destruction capacity. Unlike the theories they longed for the end of history, today the practices of redistribution of order and chaos can effectively end it. The advantage of other animals about us, sapients, is that they dare the impossible. Which does not immunize them from our possible follies. A nightmare that can be extended to all nature, which we refuse to belong because we claim that it belongs to us, thus allowing us to plunder it as its self-proclaimed masters.
It is sufficient, we believe, to measure the arrogance of the powers that compete for supremacy in its exclusive championship. This race to the "holy grail" can make us derail forever. There must be madness in so much method. Robert Ardrey, ethologist, playwright and inspiring of the play, "Star Spangled," which debuted at Broadway in 1935, set that "society is a group of organized unequal beings for the unit of needs." We remove the painful conclusion that humans does not exist due to lack of common objectives. We would be very grateful to those who could prove that our kind pursues the same goals, so we are all brothers.
We exclude from the competition Artificial Intelligence (IA), whose tendency to make the gussy is typical of the hyper-powerful we fear. However, we are called to interpret. At what point is the struggle between powers to obtain the best balance between order and chaos? It depends on how competitors portray themselves the ideal pattern of such manipulable mixture. There is no absolute “self” of the two paradigms, only provisional mutual adjustments. Dialectics of siamese twins. So that the total order is equal to the total chaos. Mirror embarrassment. The two poles are faces of Janus, Roman god of doors and passages, guardian of the thresholds, the limit (noun and verb). Our adoptive home.
Chaos is the dynamic order of the world. Uncontrollable in scientific categories because it agitated by history. Ordering inner chaos is a task to which any society that wants to be a geopolitical subject should be dedicated. In order to compete in the conquest of territorial and spiritual spaces, counted as states or contestable. No sovereign subject can aspire to dominate everything and everyone. Nor can it be established above the connection network that informs any system, from the human body to the social. The supreme mind of absolute authority is a tragicomic fiction. Pathologist/philosopher Neil Theise warns that "the brain is on the net and is performed as it works. It is not simply the mind to scrutinize the rest of the body from its throne in the skull." We are an organ architecture with specific functions. None works alone. All interactions are local. Each element of the complex system interacts with all other elements thanks to woven networks of local calls.
Translated into geopolitics, no one can exert complete dominance over their society, and even less about this archipelago composed of peripheral communities centered on the leader who wants to be an empire. A domain that incurable skeptics extend to God. If he existed, he would have to limit himself to provide his creatures in unbridled expansion, dedicated to destroying creation. Thus deny his own deity. Or exercise it on a reduced scale. If God exists, it is a demigod. Does it seem familiar to you? We are experiencing an excess of chaos produced by the simultaneous crisis of “number one” and its opponents.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:05:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Architecture | Nuno Soares Proposal for Hac-Sá Beach Wins Prize</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/arquitectura-proposta-de-nuno-soares-para-praia-de-hac-sa-vence-premio/</link><description>“Park of Tides”, a project led by architect Nuno Soares, from the “Urban Pratice” studio, received the Silver Award in the “Landscape Design - Public Landscape” category in the London Design Awards 2024.
The proposal, launched in a public tender by invitation by the Institute for Macao Municipal Affairs in early 2024, aimed to “create an accessible pedestrian route that would connect the two ends of the beach, incorporating simultaneously leisure facilities”, describes the statement.
"Park of Tides" is inspired "in the natural rhythm of the tides", having an area of ​​12 thousand square meters, where it reinterprets "the route with an expansion in the form of wave". In this proposal, it is foreseen “a modern, green and accessible space by the sea, which values ​​the natural beauty and recreational value of Hac Sá beach”.
Nuno Soares also developed three zones, centered on leisure and interactive spaces, exploration of natural materials and outdoor activities and another place with “design and contemporary facilities”. Thus, together, these three zones "reimagine the riverside area as a multifunctional and inclusive destination for visitors to engage, explore and relax."
Cited by the same note, Nuno Soares explained that this project “adopts a minimal impact approach, where permeable structures and natural materials are involved with the terrain”, as well as representing a “commitment” of the studio “with sustainable and inclusive architectural practices, ensuring ecological preservation while increasing the well-being of the community”.
The London Design Awards, together with the International Awards Associate, recognize projects that are exceptional and creative influence proposing to promote works of designers involved in various fields, bringing recognition those who overcome the industry.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:43:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Images about China populated New Show from Halftone</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/imagens-sobre-a-china-povoam-nova-mostra-da-halftone/</link><description>Halftone-Macao Photographic Association inaugurates this Friday a new exhibition dedicated to China's culture and visions. “The Spirit of China” is the name of the show that can be seen on the 3rd floor of The Parisian Macao, in Cotai, from 6.30 pm, being patent until May 11.
This collective exhibition brings together the works of 17 photographers based in Macau, which exploit, through strong visual narratives, the evolution of Chinese identity and its contemporary meaning. Names such as João Palla, Sofia Mota, Sara Augusto or Francisco Ricarte, among others. Some are dedicated exclusively to photography, others just make it a hobby. The idea is to reveal this crossing ways of photographing.
According to a statement from Halftone, which also publishes a photography magazine, “the show proposes a reflection on how fast urbanization and the emergence of megacities coexist with historical neighborhoods, such as religious rituals and old festivities dialogue with digital culture, and how new generations are redefining what it means to be Chinese in the 21st century”.
“With the use of documentary, contemporary and conceptual photography, the works go through time and space-past, present and future imagined-offering deep visions about heritage, urban landmarks and new forms of visual expression,” he adds.
Its own dynamic
Halftone also points out, in the same note, that “more than a representation of Chinese legacy”, this exhibition “reveals identity as a living force - constantly shaped by social, dynamic diaspora and digital interconnectivity”. “The public is invited to reflect on the coexistence between the old and the new, and to get involved with the spirit of a nation in transformation,” is still mentioned.
"The Spirit of China" shows a country that "has undergone an impressive transformation in recent decades, reconfiguring not only its urban horizons and architectural landscapes, but also the very essence of its cultural identity." “Given a rapid modernization and the advancement of technology, a new generation has been building a dynamic dialogue between tradition and innovation,” the note describes.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:40:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Caligraphy | FRC welcomes new shows from today</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/caligrafia-frc-acolhe-nova-mostra-a-partir-de-hoje/</link><description>The Rui Cunha Foundation gallery hosts a new show of handwriting.

The official also adds that “besides awakening the mental potential of our most mature participants, the practice of handwriting serves to enrich their understanding and appreciation of this form of art, through collaborative learning and exchange. Participants transmit their stories with ink, expressing their emotions through works of art. This effort perfectly reflects the principle of“ lifelong learning ”, he said.
The Passion of Art
In the presentation of the show, to Wan O, who was tutor of this project, refers to his dedication to the universe of handwriting, in the connection to teaching.
“As a tutor of this project, I have a master's degree in education and more than 20 years of experience in teaching calligraphy. I received several awards from the Macau Caligraphy Contest for basic and secondary school teachers, reflecting my profound commitment to nourishing this form of art. My dedication to excellence in education was worth recognizing as a" excellence tutor "," he explained.

Hong Kong Stock Exchange concessionaire shares recorded strong breaks, following the trend of world markets after US President Donald Trump has decided to impose new rates on imported products by the US country.
Yesterday, the Hang Seng Index, the main Hong Kong Stock Exchange, had a 13.62 percent break, and Macao dealers followed the trend, with similar losses.
In relative terms, SJM was the company with the highest devaluation, with the price of actions to fall 17.62 percent. At the time of opening the market, each action was valued at $ 2.44 of Hong Kong, but at the time of the closure the value had fallen to $ 2.01 of Hong Kong per action.

According to the company, after years in denial, the landlords of stores begin to realize that they will lose money
 
The Centaline Real Estate Agency foresees that housing prices will have a broken 10 to 20 percent throughout the year. The forecast appears in the agency's latest report on the local real estate market, published at the end of last week, and points out that the sector crosses an "ice age."
"The Macao real estate market is going through a 'U' form phase of development, so the pressure to reduce housing prices are expected to extend," is mentioned. "Housing prices will cross a new vacancy of breaks between 10 and 20 percent," he was added.
By referring to the form of “U”, the centine predicts that the fall is followed by a period of growth after a phase of stagnation. However, it is necessary to reach the bottom. And this moment is difficult to predict: "The dimension of the fall will depend on several factors, including the pace of interest reduction in the United States, as well as market aid policies," he was explained.
Based on this trend, the agency admits that a “ice age” is lived: “the real estate market has entered the ice age, with housing prices and the volume of transactions falling,” he was written. "In the second quarter, our estimates point to the volume of transactions of about 200 transactions per month," was planned.
Wake up to reality
Regarding the store lease market, the situation is not much different, and the Centaline indicates that store owners will have to accept the new reality, and possibly undo the stores. "Last year, many of the investors still believed that the drop in income price was due to the pandemic or increased interest rates. They believed that everything was going back to 'normality', so they preferred to pay interest [of mortgages] and keep the bet on their investments," he was explained.
"Recently, they began to realize that the days of good investment in stores have come to an end, the retail sales sector has been transformed and dependence on physical stores has decreased considerably. So the value of stores is gradually decreasing. In holding their investments, they will hardly get good results," he was added.
The centine thus draws a scenario at two speeds. In the most central tourism zones, it admits that there were close to 20 leases where the income value was above 100 thousand patacas. However, in community neighborhoods the situation is very different, especially at the level of stores in Nape or Horta and Costa.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:12:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Lusophone exports to China fall more than 30% until February</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/exportacoes-lusofonas-para-a-china-caem-mais-de-30-ate-fevereiro/</link><description>Exports from Portuguese -speaking countries to China fell 30.7 percent in the first two months of 2025, compared to the same period last year.
According to information from China's customs services, in January and February the Lusophone Block sold goods of $ 17 billion to the Chinese market. According to the data, gathered by the Forum for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and the Portuguese -speaking countries (Macao Forum), this is the lowest value for the first two months of a year since 2021, in the middle of COVID - 19 pandemic.
The descent was due mainly to the largest Lusophone supplier in the Chinese market, Brazil, whose sales fell one third (33.4 percent) to $ 13.7 billion. In addition, also the second largest Chinese commercial partner in the Lusophone block, Angola, saw exports decrease 16.4 percent to $ 2.37 billion. Also the sales of goods from Portugal to China decreased by 13 percent to $ 444.4 million.
On the contrary, the exports of Mozambique rose more than one third (34.4 percent) to $ 332.2 million. Equatorial Guinea exports to the Chinese market dropped 71.2 percent to $ 85.6 million, while Timor-Leste sales shred 98 percent. The exports of Sao Tome and Principe also fell 53.3 percent, although the country did not sell more than 1,000 dollars in goods.
Already Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau did not sell any merchandise to China in the first two months of 2025.
On the other hand
In the opposite direction, Chinese exports to Portuguese -speaking countries also reduced 9 percent to $ 12.2 billion.
The data reveal that Brazil was the largest buyer in the Lusophone block, with imports from China to reach $ 10.3 billion, a drop of 7.8 percent in annual terms. Second on the list comes Portugal, which bought the goods of $ 932.4 million, less than 10.5 percent than in the same period as 2024.
China registered a commercial deficit of $ 4.78 billion with the Lusophone Block in the first two months of 2025. In all, trade between Portuguese -speaking countries and China reached $ 29.2 billion, less 23.1 percent than in the same period last year.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 01:26:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Big Award Consumption | More than 130 disqualified residents</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/grande-premio-consumo-mais-de-130-residentes-desqualificados/</link><description>Until March 30, the major consumption prize generated about 115 million patacas in business. According to government data, until Saturday, 131 residents involved in abnormal transactions had been detected, which were eventually disqualified from the initiative designed to stimulate consumption
 
During the first week of the Grand Prix of Consumption, that is, until March 30, "electronic benefits were used in the amount of more than 23.6 million patacas and immediate discount for elderly in the amount of about 6.15 million patacas." According to data released yesterday by the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT), in the first week of the initiative, which started on March 24, consumption was generated of about 115 million patacas.
Despite the growth of turnover, one of the likely failures in the system provided by the authorities confirmed itself. Until last Saturday, 131 users of payment institutions and online TakeAway platforms were identified involved in abnormal transactions, which were eventually “immediately disqualified to participate in this activity”, not being able to participate in discount coupons or use coupons draws, describes DSEDT.
Anomal situations are found when residents get raffle opportunities with irregular means, after buying products more than 50 patacas on the “Takeaway Platform”.
The irregularities were discovered through a joint supervision mechanism by DSEDT and payment institutions and TakeAway platforms, in order to "guarantee justice."
Curteira aim
More than 20,000 commercial establishments joined this edition of the Grand Prix of Consumption, accepting the electronic benefits and immediate discounts for the elderly. DSEDT adds that more than 120 of these stores and restaurants have launched "simultaneously, additional consumer offers."
As the initiative aims to stimulate the business of small commerce and restoration of community neighborhoods, discounts cannot be used to pay water bills, electricity, natural gas, fuels, telecommunications services, transfronight transport, medical services, services provided by public institutions. Nor can they be used in casinos, banks, insurers and other financial institutions, pledge houses, large -scale supermarkets, property management, educational institutions, parking parks, taxis, parking meters, and automatic sales machines. The initiative will take place until June 1st.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 01:25:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Crime | Young man transferred 600 thousand patacas to Burlões</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/crime-jovem-transferiu-600-mil-patacas-para-burloes/</link><description>A young place was circumvented in 600,000 patacas, in another scam in which the criminals took place through the interior police.

To ensure an investigation and prove innocence the alleged authorities asked the young man to indicate his personal information, including bank details.

An advanced age man was circumvented in about 78,000 patacas after believing he was going to receive a 12,000 patacas commission to help an alleged school buy cleaning products.
According to the newspaper or Mun, the case happened on March 31, when a man was added by an unknown contact in the Wechat application. This contact was presented as a school principal, who needed to buy cleaning products for the institution.
However, the alleged director told the elderly that he had argued with the supplier, so to have access to usual discounts needed the transaction to be made by someone else.
The elderly was promised a committee of 12 thousand patacas, which would be paid after the school received the cleaning products. Without distrusting anything, the man made the payment online, worth 78 thousand patacas.

The company's director for China argues that Macau is “an important platform” for economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries
 
The first long-haul load route between Macao and Madrid tore off on Thursday with a Boeing 777F operated by Ethiopian Airlines, which raised flight from Macao International Airport (MIA).
The Ethiopian airline will make two round -trip trips per week, and the 777F Boeing will mainly transport transfronic electronic trade goods, according to a note from the Mia Management company, to which Lusa had access.
"The new route will further improve the air load network between Asia and Europe, providing more efficient logistical support for exports in the Great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau (GBA) area, and boosting logistical competitiveness."
According to Mia Manager, Madrid is one of Europe's leading logistics centers, so "the opening of this new route will satisfy the growing demand for air load, while reinforcing connectivity between GBA and European markets," the load volumes are expected to be "increasing".
Ethiopian Airlines' national director for China, Aman Wole Gurmu, cited in the note, said Macau is “an important platform” for economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, so the launch of the new route will reinforce this role, constituting an air logistics corridor that will connect Europe and Asia.
Fill in gaps
"This new route not only fills the gap in cargo transportation between Macau and Spain, but also takes advantage of the local network in Spain to connect Macau to the markets in Africa and South America, forming a triangular logistics network" Asia-Africa-Europe "," according to Aman Wole Gurmu, although the chased network seems to be "quadrangular", given the inclusion of the American continent.
"This will help Macao become a key center for transfronight exports of electronic trade and cargo transportation in the large bay area," he added.
According to the Mia Management company, there is a constant growth in the cargo business in recent years, looking for air logistics to be driven by the rapid increase in transionic electronic trade, with Macau Airport involved in a load transport in the order of 108,000 tons in 2024.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 01:21:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist.

Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

Future markets in the US also closed in red, with S&amp;P 500 lost 4.2 percent, while Dow Jones Industrial Averag fell 3.5 percent. The Nasdaq index lost 5.3 percent.
Tokyo negotiations opened in significant fall, with Nikkei, the main rate of the Japanese scholarship, losing almost 8 percent, shortly after the market opening. One hour later, 7.1 percent was dropped to 31 375.71. The second Japanese index, Topix, also opened to lose 8.64 percent at the beginning of the session.
South Korea Kospi opened to lose 5.5 percent to 2,328.52, while Australia's ASX 200 ASX 200 began negotiations to fall 6.3 percent to 7,184.70.
The Taipé Stock Exchange reference index, Taiex, a few minutes after opening, fell 9.8 percent, losing 2,054 points to 19,243, with the Hon Hai (Foxconn) technology company, the world's largest manufacturer of electronic products, and the giant Taiwanese TSMC, which dominates the world chip foundation market, to also register losses close to 10 percent.
Likewise, oil prices remained a descending plan, with the US oil reference price to fall 4 percent, or $ 2.50, to $ 59.49 per barrel. Brent oil, the international standard, gave $ 2.25 to $ 63.33 per barrel.
The monetary market also registered major movements, with the US dollar to fall to 145.98 Japanese yen from 146.94 yen, and Iene is often seen as a safe port in times of turbulence. The euro rose from $ 1.0962 to $ 1.0967.
Cash recession
On Friday, the worst record since Covid-19, Wall Street closed with S&amp;P 500 to fall 6 percent and the Dow 5.5 percent. The compound nasdaq fell 5.8 percent.
The losses accelerated after China equaled the large increased customs rights announced by Trump last week, climbing the stop in a trade war that could end with a recession of the world economy.
Even a better report than expected about the US labor market, released on Friday, which usually assumes itself as the economic highlight of each month, was not enough to sustain the fall of markets. All actions of the 500 S&amp;P 500 index companies, except 14, fell on Friday.
China's response to American tariffs has caused immediate acceleration of losses in world markets. Beijing's Ministry of Commerce has announced that it will respond to US 34 tariffs imposed by China imports with its own 34 percent rate on imports of all US products from 10 April, among other measures.
The United States and China are the two largest economies in the world. Trump announced on Wednesday that he will impose tariffs on countries around the world. About the rates, the US president said they "will bring growth like never seen" and "faster than you think."
In the case of the EU, Trump said that the fare will be 20 percent, since, he explained, the European Block taxes US products at 39 percent, on average, while South Korea, for example, tributes at almost 50 percent on average. The tariffs imposed by the United States on South Korean products will be 26 percent.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:48:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | IWO JIMA VISIT IMPERIAL</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/japao-casal-imperial-de-visita-a-iwo-jima/</link><description>The visit of the Japanese emperors serves to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, in a territory that was the scene of one of the most bloody battles of the conflict
 
The emperors of Japan, Naruhito and Masako, yesterday arrived on the island of Iwo Jima, scenario of one of the most bloody battles of World War II, under the 80th anniversary celebrations of the end of the global conflict.
This is the first time that the imperial couple has visited the remote island, now officially designated Ioto, located about 1,250 kilometers south of Tokyo, where they will pay tribute to the war memorials highlighted there.
The Battle of Iwo Jima is considered one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific World War Pacific campaign. During the five weeks that lasted, about 7,000 US soldiers and almost 22,000 Japanese soldiers were killed, among 80,000 soldiers who fought on this island of only 21 square kilometers.
The island take, remote and strongly fortified, on March 26, 1945, was considered a fundamental step in advancing allied forces in the Pacific, in order to invade the main territory of the Japanese archipelago, although the strategic importance of the battle is still debated by the experts.
The island was returned to Japanese sovereignty in 1968 and officially renamed Ioto in 2007, at the request of the area inhabitants, a name actually used by the former inhabitants. The island was wrongly designated by Iwo Jima when the inhabitants were removed shortly before the battle.
After the occupation, the inhabitants were not allowed to return and, during the US occupation, the island remained that name, which contributed to popularizing the caption of Joe Roshental's historical photography, where US Marines are raising the US Flag, an image adapted to clint Eastwood.
Other visits
In 1994, emperors Akihito and Michiko visited the island to pay tribute, within the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, marked a year later.
The presence of Naruhito and Masako follows a previous tribute on March 29, starring Japanese Prime Minister Shigero Ishiba, and the Ministers of Defense of Japan and the United States, Gen Nakatani and Pete Hegseth.
The digression of the emperors this year continues in June with a stint in Okinawa, the southernmost island city hall of Japan, where another of the most emblematic battles of this war took place, the battle of Okinawa.
In the coming months, the imperial couple will also visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on the first trip to the cities devastated by US nuclear bombing since they ascended to the throne.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:33:11</pubDate></item><item><title>China prepared to wage commercial combat with USA</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/china-preparada-para-travar-combate-comercial-com-eua/</link><description>The Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper (CCP) yesterday admitted that the rates imposed by Washington will impact the Chinese economy, but pointed out that the leadership in Beijing was already preparing for this moment.
"Although international markets generally consider that US tariff abuse exceeded expectations, the [Communist] Central Committee had already foreseen this new round of economic and commercial containment and repression against China, fully estimated its potential impact and prepared response plans with sufficient time and reserves," the People's Diary said.
Recognizing that the application of additional customs of 34 percent on imports from China, in addition to the 20 percent rates previously imposed, will result in a “reducing bilateral trade with the US” and a “short -term negative impact on exports”, the newspaper recalled that “many US products have high dependence on China”.
"The US depend on China not only for many consumer goods, but also for investment and intermediate products, with a dependence of over 50 percent in various categories, which makes it difficult to find alternatives in the international international market," reads in the editorial.
The percentage of exports from China to the United States, compared to total external sales, fell from 19.2 percent in 2018 to 14.7 percent in 2024. Part of this fall is due to 'triangular trade', in which products are exported almost completed from China to other countries, including Vietnam, Thailand or Cambodia, where a component or finish is added, In order to change the manufacture place, aiming to circumvent the rates.
The People's Diary recalled that, in recent years, “despite internal and external pressures,” Beijing “has been persisted in doing difficult but correct things,” including disappointing the real estate sector and reducing the indebtedness of local and small and medium financial institutions. "These three major risks have been effectively controlled and contained and are decreasing," he said.
Big
Pointing out the “large dimension” of the Chinese economy, the newspaper recalled that China has monetary policy instruments, such as reducing mandatory reserve ratio and interest rates, to stimulate domestic consumption with “extraordinary strength”, which would allow the Asian to reduce its dependence on exports.
"The domestic market has a wide margin of maneuver," said the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper. He also stressed the country's ability to transform the adverse effect of US measurements into an "impulse" to accelerate economic transformation and "industrial innovation."
"Strangular, repressing and restricting only forces China to accelerate fundamental technological advances in key areas," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:30:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Commerce | USA accused of unilateralism, protectionism and intimidation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/comercio-eua-acusados-de-unilateralismo-proteccionismo-e-intimidacao/</link><description>The trade war imposed on the world by Donald Trump intensifies. Beijing responds with new rates and suspends imports from various US products, while ensuring that “the sky will not fall”
 
China yesterday accused the United States of unilateralism, protectionism and economic intimidation, given the intensifying of the trade war between Beijing and Washington.
"Putting 'America first', above international rules, is a typical act of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying," the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lin Jian told a press conference.
Last week, Trump imposed an additional 34 percent rate on products from China, as part of the “Liberation Day”, which added to two 10 percent rounds already declared in February and March. China quickly retaliated with its own 34 percent rate on US products.
Beijing also suspended imports of sorghum, capoeira birds and bone flour from some US companies. China's latest retaliation measures include more export controls on rare land minerals, essential for various technologies, and a judicial action in the World Trade Organization.
Lin stated that Trump's rates impair the stability of global production and supply chains and seriously affect world economic recovery. "Pressure and threats are not the best way to deal with China," said Lin. "China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," he added.
Confidence votes
Beijing transmitted confidence yesterday, with the People's Diary, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, to ensure that "the sky will not fall." "Given the indiscriminate blows of US rates, we know what we are doing and we have instruments at our disposal," he added.
It is not known if China's leader Xi Jinping will meet Trump to reach an agreement. Lin addressed questions about a possible meeting to other departments. On Sunday, Chinese government officials met with representatives from US companies, including Tesla and GE Healthcare.
"The root of the problem of customs rates is in the US," said Ling Ji, Deputy Minister of Commerce, at the meeting with 20 US companies, according to a statement. "We hope that US companies can solve the problem by the root, issue reasonable statements, make concrete measures and work together to safeguard the stability of global supply chains," he said.
Ling, who is also China's adjunct commercial negotiator, has ensured that the Asian country will protect “legitimate rights and interests of foreign -funded companies according to the law” and “actively promote the resolution of their problems and demands”.
Guaranteed protection
The Chinese Deputy Minister of Commerce, Ling Ji, said yesterday to representatives of US companies such as Tesla and GE Healthcare that Beijing will “always protect” the rights of companies with foreign capital, compared to the trade war triggered by Washington.
"China has been, is and will be an ideal, safe and promising investment destination for foreign investors," Ling said during a round table with more than 20 US capital companies in Beijing, according to a statement widespread by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 23:28:56</pubDate></item><item><title>Earthquake | Number of dead in Myanmar increases to 3,471</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/sismo-numero-de-mortos-em-myanmar-aumenta-para-3-471/</link><description>The death toll of March 28 in Myanmar increased to 3,471, with more than 4,600 injured and 214 missing, yesterday the military junta in power in the country.

The previous balance, released on Saturday, pointed to 3,354 dead, 4,850 injured and 220 missing, having been rescued by 653 people. The 7.7 magnitude earthquake has reached a large area of ​​the country, causing significant damage to six regions and states, including the capital Nayphitaw, leaving many areas without energy and communications.
The shake also aggravated the humanitarian crisis triggered by the country's civil war, which internally moved more than three million people, according to the United Nations.
Military Government leader General Min Aung Hlaing said that the earthquake was the second strongest in the country's history after the magnitude 8 earthquake of Mandalay in May 1912.
Global Aids
The regime also explained that more than 150 tons of humanitarian aid - from countries like China, the United States, Singapore, India and Thailand - entered the country since the earthquake.
An estimate mentions collapse or partial damage in at least 21,783 houses, 805 office buildings, 1,690 pagodas, 1,041 schools, 921 monasteries and convents, 312 religious buildings, 48 ​​hospitals and 18 hectares of plantations. Min Aung Hlaing, confirmed - in another article published yesterday by the official newspaper - the plan to build temporary schools to ensure that children return to class as soon as possible.
The Armed Forces returned yesterday to accuse the ethnic guerrillas and the democratic opposition to commit “terrorist acts”, referring to alleged attacks on state and military facilities, in the midst of territorial dispute that has worsened since the coup d'état of February 2021.
The military and various armed resistance groups declared a temporary ceasefire on Wednesday, after the earthquake, to facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid. On Wednesday, the United Nations Office for Human Rights accused the Military Board of not respecting the ceasefire, having made at least 16 attacks since the truce and a total of 61 since the earthquake.

Coast Guard spokesman Liu Dejun explained in a statement that the Japanese ship "entered illegally in the territorial waters of the Diaoyu islands on April 5 and 6" and that the Chinese coast guard ships "took the necessary control measures against him, according to the law," while "warned him to stay away."
"The Chinese Coast Guard will continue to protect national sovereignty and maritime rights and interests," the spokesman warned in the official statement, adding that the islands "are inherent territory of China." The spokesman also asked Japan to “interrupt his illegal activities” in the area.
In May 2024, China granted its coastal guard new capabilities, including the authority to stop foreign vessels suspected of illegally entering its territorial waters, in the midst of increasing territorial tensions with Japan and the Philippines.
The Chinese Coast Guard has also seen its material operational capabilities from a material point of view, thanks to the sending of more vessels and the increase in logistics support.
The dispute for the Diaoyu islands, won by Japan after the war with China in 1894-95, intensified after Japan nationalized three of them in September 2012.
Located in the sea of ​​east China, about 150 kilometers northeast of Taiwan, which also claims sovereignty, the uninhabited Diaoyu islands cover an area of ​​about seven square kilometers and adjacent waters may contain significant gas and oil deposits.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 01:35:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Locked agreement for sale of Tiktok in the USA after Trump impotes tariffs</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/travado-acordo-para-venda-de-tiktok-nos-eua-apos-trump-impor-tarifas/</link><description>China's government has blocked an agreement to sell US investors from Tiktok, a platform controlled by the Chinese Bytedance, after the imposition of tariffs by the United States, a source said.
The source, which asked not to be identified, told the Associated Press (AP) news agency that the US presidency believed the parties were close to an agreement. The agreement provided that Tiktok's operations in the US were separated in a new company, held in the country, detained and operated by a majority of US investors, with Bytedance to maintain a minority position.
Optimism around the agreement will have led US President Donald Trump to say Friday that he would maintain an operational Tiktok in the country for another 75 days, the day before expiring the deadline for selling the platform.
“My government has been working hard to save Tiktok, and we made a tremendous progress,” Trump, who said the business was imminent on Thursday. "We look forward to working with Tiktok and China to close the deal," said the US president.
But Beijing fought the deal on Thursday, a day after Trump announced comprehensive tariffs worldwide, including an additional 34 percent rate on China's imports.
For resolve
Bytedance representatives called the White House to indicate that China would not approve the agreement until there were trade and tariff negotiations, the source told AP. The agreement was built over months, with the team of Vice President JD Vance to negotiate directly with various potential investors and bytedance employees.
The plan provided for a period of 120 days to complete regulatory procedures and financing. The agreement was approved by existing investors, new investors, bytedance and the US government. A bytedance spokesman confirmed in a statement that the company has been discussing a "potential solution" with the US government, but stressed that an "agreement was not implemented."
"There are important questions to resolve," said the spokesman. "Any agreement will be subject to approval under the Chinese law," he added. Bytedance launched the Douyin application in 2016, and after its success in China, created in 2017 a global version, Tiktok, growing faster than Facebook and Instagram rivals.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 01:31:59</pubDate></item><item><title>WTO | China files a complaint about US tariffs</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/omc-china-apresenta-queixa-sobre-tarifas-dos-eua/</link><description>Beijing vehemently disputes Trump's rates to his exports, accusing the US of violating the basic rules of the World Trade Organization
 
China announced Friday that it sent to the World Trade Organization (WTO) the issue of the tariffs imposed by the United States to its exports, having filed a complaint in the dispute resolution mechanism.
"China filed a complaint in the WTO dispute resolution mechanism," said the Beijing Ministry of Commerce, in a statement quoted by AFP.
China also announced Friday the imposition of a 34 percent rate on imports of all US products from April 10, in response to the new tariffs imposed by the US.
"The imposition by the United States of so -called 'reciprocal tariffs' severely violates WTO rules, severely impairs the legitimate rights and interests of WTO members and severely undermines the rules -based multilateral trade system and international economic and commercial order," the Ministry of Commerce said.
"It is a typical practice of unilateral intimidation that endanger the stability of the global economic and commercial order. China is firmly opposed to this," he added.
China's measures come after US President Donald Trump, on Wednesday, imposed a new 34 percent rate on Chinese products, part of what Washington calls “reciprocal” tariffs over countries around the world. In the case of Beijing, these rates are additional to 20 percent rates already in force, which causes Chinese imports to be subject to a rate of at least 54 percent.
Attacked Asia
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce expressed its "firm opposition" on Thursday and promised to retaliate to "safeguard" the rights and interests of the Asian country. In early March, China announced 10 percent and 15 percent rates on US agricultural products in response to 20 percent tariffs that Trump imposed on Chinese products.
During his first presidency (2017-2021), Trump had already had a tense relationship with Beijing as he imposed several rounds of about $ 370 billion annually, to which China responded with rates on US exports.
The US president also imposed high rates on Wednesday on the countries for which Chinese factories moved after the first commercial conflict, including Vietname (46 percent), Cambodia (49 percent) and Laos (48 percent), blocking the exit of Chinese products.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 01:30:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Earthquake | Myanmar Military Junta declares ceasefire in the civil war until April 22 to facilitate help</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/02/sismo-junta-militar-de-myanmar-declara-cessar-fogo-na-guerra-civil-ate-22-abril-para-facilitar-ajuda/</link><description>The Military Junta in Power in Myanmar declared a ceasefire in the civil war today until April 22, to facilitate help to the population, after the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that hit the country on March 28.

The announcement, made in a statement from the Military High Command, is followed by unilateral temporary ceasefogs declared by armed resistance groups that oppose the military regime.
Television news indicated that ethnic armed groups and local militias should refrain from attacking state security forces and military bases, and should not organize, gather forces or expand their areas of influence.
If such groups do not comply with these conditions, the army will take the necessary measures, according to the statement.

Vice-rector Álvaro Barbosa expects, soon, the increase in master's students from 30 to 200. Regarding the internationalization of higher education, the official advocates changes in student visas to facilitate recruitment
 
Does the recruitment of students from the interior of China remain a matter pending to the University of Saint Joseph?
It is a process that is underway. We have had huge support from the Macao government in negotiations to obtain the quota for our university, and they have been tireless in the effort to try to resolve the issues raised by the central government. Many of the questions are legitimate and concern concerns that arise. We were granted a temporary quota of 30 students for masters ago over a probative period, which served to evaluate how we, as Western University, would host students from China. From China, there is this concern with the host of students in Macau. I think we have made a huge effort and the students who are there, included in this contingent, are quite satisfied.
Is this quota for masters just?
Yes. For a degree we do not have authorization yet. In this way, we are currently at the time we try to overcome this probative period in order to obtain a quota of about 200 students for masters. We are in the final phase of the evaluation process and everything has been doing well. We will have the possibility that, next academic year, expand this quota. That would be great, because for our university, to have a greater impact of our mission in Macao, it is essential to have access to students from mainland China. We cannot be a university in an integrated region in a country like China, and not contact with students from China.
Is it more difficult for USJ to compete with other universities, such as those of Hong Kong, by foreign students, outside China?
The issue of recruitment of international students has become a priority for Macao universities. In the last two or three years, it has become evident that this internationalization is very important. What difficulty is there? There is the issue related to student visas, as these visas currently do not allow students to do any kind of work, denying them that minimum local subsistence mechanism to be able to meet expenses. Nor is it contemplated the possibility of, when the student concludes his formation, to be in the territory and find work. What all countries and regions that are competitive in higher education do, such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Australia, is to have incentive policies. Allow students to work part -time, for example. In Hong Kong when a degree ends, the student can stay in the territory up to a maximum of two years to find a job. This kind of measures do not yet exist in Macau, but I think the government is pondering this possibility. From the moment the decision was made that the internationalization of higher education was important, this must be accompanied with the corresponding measures. The current student visa is extremely limiting and does not encourage the coming to Macao to study, only allows coming. This issue was not as present as it is now, but now there is a strategic policy of internationalization.
It is also a matter of survival for local universities.
Yes. Perhaps there is no greater example of a catalyst for the diversification of Macau's economy than higher education. We have ten institutions, 60,000 students in about 700,000 inhabitants. This is the potential of internationalization, to foster diversification.

And also the research that comes out of higher education.
The investigation, the dynamics of the work that is done. There are a number of vectors that higher education brings to a region or country, this happened to Portugal, for example, with the policy of doctoral scholarships for students from abroad, which completely changed the dynamics of higher education. Cape Verde developed thanks to the impact of higher education.
Then we need to make the system more flexible in Macau.
I don't know if it's a matter of having a holistic view of strategy. There may be an idea, but then it does not intervene in all the necessary dimensions to achieve a certain goal. But I am very optimistic. I believe this new student policy is a key step to be taken in Macau. The internationalization strategy followed by all these countries and regions I spoke, and were successful in capturing international students, was always the same. No need to invent much. First, one should increase the capacity and notoriety of universities, and then a policy of scholarships, which will enhance a student flow, creating a reference for the territory, so that studying there becomes a habit. After this flow of students for a few years, an image is already created and some scholarships can be removed, which students will continue to choose a particular territory to study in it. Australia has a huge higher education industry, for example, and I think that in Macau we just have to follow the same strategies. We do, at USJ, that a little.
How, in concrete terms?
We offer many scholarships, and in this sense the Diocese of Macao has helped us build this flow of international students that allow us to create this dynamic that we hope will be sustainable by itself in the future. I think the government is also doing this. There have always been scholarships in Macau, attributed mainly by the Macau Foundation, but this measure will be strengthened. Solving the student's visa issue, creating a scholarship incentive system for five to ten years, Macau will have a bright future as an international higher education destination. But we need to invest, continue, and it takes a few years.
USJ created the “Macau Hub” platform, in partnership with the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in 2023. At what stage is this project?
This project has to do with our interest in developing a relationship dynamic of Lusophone countries centered in Lisbon in the area of ​​entrepreneurship, first. This cabinet we have at CCCM is not intended to offer training in Portugal, but we want to do something else. As we are positioned in the Great Bay and with Hengqin, where it is intended to activate a business ecosystem, we want to take advantage of the fact that we have relations with the Lusophone world to activate the access of the startups of Portugal, Brazil and Angola, above all, to the great bay and hengqin. We are trying to create a kind of incubator of transnational companies, in which we support the development of Lusophone businesses that want to settle in the large bay and also the reverse system. Strategically, for a university, it is absolutely fundamental to have a dynamic in the area of ​​entrepreneurship. Currently, more than half of our students do not want to go to the corporate world, but create their own businesses. Just as universities have to have employability solutions, they also have to have them for entrepreneurs, who are increasingly. So a university has to have a business incubator. My vision of the future for higher education goes around: a university, besides having a library and canteen, will also have its own business incubator. I would say that most students of management or economy courses dream of having their own business, especially in China. China is perhaps one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world. The CCCM welcomes this initiative in Portugal, but we also work with the Portuguese Catholic University.
And concrete results, already have it?
We have a number of small initial projects that are starting now, and we also work with many business organizations. We have now negotiated a series of projects, and I think everything will develop very quickly, based on the manifestations of interest we have. We were in Angola in December and we have already aligned a series of initiatives, we also have projects with Brazil and Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:56:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Adelina Moura, teacher and trainer: “The mobile phone is like a Swiss knife”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/adelina-moura-docente-e-formadora-o-telemovel-e-como-um-canivete-suico/</link><description>Graduated in the area of ​​educational technologies, Adelina Moura will conduct lectures to parents, students and teachers about the use of digital technologies in classrooms, within the “Letters &amp; Company” festival of the Portuguese Institute of the East. The teacher understands that prohibiting mobile phone in schools is not a solution
 
What are the challenges felt by teachers with the introduction of technologies in the classroom? Can the mobile phone actually be a complement to learning?
Yes. I've been saying this since 2005. The mobile phone can be an excellent learning tool, a means to motivate students and to enrich their learning. We have a kind of Swiss knife here, a very powerful equipment in the hands of the students and there is a school failure, because they do not work and help students enhance this equipment they have. What happens is that students learn in the worst way, in a destructed way, by attempt-rrove. There is a gap, as students are not alerted to the positive potential for mobile phone use. They face their mobile phones as a free time use, spending time on social networks and scrolling, and time consumes. It is essential that teachers are users, in their practices, mobile phones, and for the preparation of classes and other projects, to know how to prepare students. I consider that the school has lost several stages of students' preparation and awareness to use these equipment that lead to classes and with which schools have not spent any money. With the prohibition of bringing the mobile phone to the classroom we did not advance anything in this regard.
During the pandemic period, for example, the use of technologies, with distance learning, was quite enhanced.
But during the pandemic we also burned some steps regarding the use of digital by teachers, because before the pandemic many teachers did not believe or used. They thought it was a fashion and they saw no use in the use of mobile phones and other technologies. With the pandemic the use of these equipment proved that without them the situation of education would have been much worse. In these pandemic years, teachers have become more aware of the technologies that already exist and are available to anyone. With internet access on mobile phone, something that has existed since 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone, the e-learning system is enhanced and then we move to “Mobile Learning”, where you can learn anywhere and anytime with mobile devices. It is this reality that we see a little away from school.
And after the pandemic, how has it been?
I think we will take a few more steps towards digital literacy. With Artificial Intelligence (IA), it seems that we are as in the phase I created my first website in 1999 or email in 1995. We are at the beginning. But it is 30 years of technology where there have been many changes, and technology in fact goes on and if we immediately do not realize what we have available, we and students, we help create a moat that has happened in the past compared to digital. In the face of AI, if we do not look back and do not realize what was not done and should have been at school level, we are wasting time. Only a few years from now will people be alert to AI, and the gap is increasing. Hence it is very important to bet now, in this early stage, in the training of teachers, students and families.
Is there much ignorance of parents, removal from this reality?
We have parents who are from this century. That is, they were born with the existence of computers, internet, saw the appearance of the smartphone. But when they studied, the school did not talk about the potential of digital. So these former students came to society and did not bring this sensitivity to digital, to educate their children. We teachers, when we do digital training, are doing good to society because we are also preparing these young people for the future, because they will be parents and should be aware of educating their children. At school we do not only prepare for the job market, but for personal and family life. Hence teacher education is essential. The invitation I received from IPOR seems to me an excellent holistic view of everything, because the school includes several actors, connecting with society.
How should AI be introduced into the classroom?
We currently watch changes in search engines, in fact. We have search engines created from root to Age Age, for example. The best way to introduce AI into the classroom is to ask students and how they use it, and already resort to this tool. At the beginning of the academic year I always ask students to answer a questionnaire about their digital routines, and then I know more or less their practices. In 2023, when the chatgPT came out, I introduced AI in my classes, and realized that students were using this tool to deceive the teachers. Students have to realize that when using AI, they are falling into a certain trap because they are not learning. It is the law of the lowest effort, equal to the phase in which the internet emerged, when students selected, copied and sent to the teacher. We now have the problem that the answers are in Brazilian Portuguese, for example, and I see soon that AI was used. We have, therefore, to dismantle this action in the heads and face them. I tell them that they are being intellectually dishonest and that they have not read the AI ​​response, for example. Since 2023, I feel that students, in the answers to this questionnaire I do, say they are afraid to use chatgpt because they are afraid of being caught by teachers. That is, it seems to have gained some conscience.
It will give these lectures in a different educational context in Asia, where the use of mobile phone can be earlier. How will you deal with these differences, or do you understand that the problems of using technology in the classroom are transversal?
It is a transverse question. Do we have to wonder if the use of a particular equipment and tool will make us wiser? It seems to me not, because we may have the equipment, but the use we make it varies a lot. I tell my students that they should be ashamed, because they have much easier access to content than in my time, when we truly had to do research and read in physical format. I tell them that with this technology they should all have a grade 20, and that they are wasting resources, being dishonest intellectually, because they sign works that are not theirs and do not read, even, they deliver. One of the works we have with students is to teach them how to make bibliographic references, refer to the sources. But I am an optimistic by nature, and I hope that in a decade, secondary education students who are fathers and mothers will be able to deal with these problems of social networks and increase fraud with their children. It is this “parents school” that the school can help create. We are in a moment with no return of digital, and forbidding is the most comfortable situation, but it is not the best to face reality. We have to use the right words to alert. We have in this time of alerts and consciences, encouraging the critical spirit of our students, which is little today.

Speaking to HM, the academic enhances the interconnection between tourism, economy and geography, and lists its possibilities, limitations and effects, including Macao
 
 
In this book it speaks of the concept of “spatial economy”, in connection with tourism and geography. How is this connection?
Economic geography combines the geographical context with economic processes, being studied the spatial distribution of economic activities. The economy of tourism is particularly sensitive to these geographical constraints, as they are the characteristics of each place that enhances the development of certain products or services. These characteristics widely exceed the physical aspects of the territory and also include culture, history, ways of life or even institutions and legal frameworks. The case of casino, something particularly important in Macao, is a good example of the importance of legal aspects to develop certain types of tourism. Economic geography has a wider scope than the spatial economy, more focused on strictly economic aspects. Being evident in tourism this relationship between economics and geography, this book establishes a double approach that systematizes the interdependence of these three aspects it refers. First explores how the concepts and theories of economic geography can apply to tourism. In the second half it makes the opposite route, discussing how the analysis of relevant problems of contemporary tourism justifies the use of economic geography. Examples are the degradation of local resources, environmental impacts, contribution to climate change, acceleration of gentrification processes or disturbance of community modes of life.
Can having an excessively -dependent economy of tourism constitute a problem or salvation?
The two things, and are both cases that economic geography can help to understand. The industrialization of economies is linked to the agglomeration processes of activities that reinforce each other when they reach a certain scale. This allows the massification of production and consumption, with reasonable costs. Contemporary industries, more associated with the integration of digital technologies and creative processes, are less clustered in specialized industrial development zones, but tend to focus on large cities and metropolitan areas. It also follows that rural areas, islands, or sites that have not followed industrialization processes, have more difficulty mobilizing investments, technologies or qualified people to innovate and develop new industries. In such cases, tourism often appears as the possible solution as it can be developed with incorporation of technology and relatively low knowledge. On the other hand, tourism consumption, not being essential to human life, is very sensitive to income fluctuations.
Can you give examples?
This was visible, for example, with the 2007/2009 international crisis. Tourism is also very vulnerable to safety problems or international epidemics, such as COVID-19 has demonstrated to the extreme. Economies too specialized in tourism are very vulnerable to external shocks and less resilient to crises. It is also visible that, being the tourist development often supported by intensive and weak labor services, the specialization in tourism can cause, in the long run, embarrassment in terms of population qualifications, the ability to innovate and integrate technology or to add value to the regional economy.
The book also speaks of “intelligent tourism” and “co-creation of experiences”, using the megados and IA. Is tourism definitely becoming more digital?
Social networks are fundamental instruments for new generations. However, they began to generalize the tools for planning or promotion of travel supported by artificial intelligence. The so-called “intelligent tourism” more generally designates the use of digital technologies to intensify information flows, consolidate the formation of networks and promote more informed and shared decision making, eventually contributing to the so-called “co-creation of experiences”. Tourism digitization has its origins in service distribution systems originally developed by airlines since the 1960s, but it would be the internet to accelerate and globalize digitization.
And social networks.
The emergence of social networks promoted the creation of a more interactive universe, potentially in real time and involving wide numbers of users and various types of supports. The generalization of the use of mobile phones permanently connected to the Internet, even on foreign travel, has further increased this potential for intensive and interactive use of data and information. This "co-creation", however, hides obvious imbalances of power.
Such as?
With regard to tourists, or consumer in general, it is usually the role of providing information, for example through social networks. This information is obtained, accumulated and marketed, sometimes without consent or even without knowledge, to eventually translate into the creation, adaptation or promotion of products and services. This process is particularly important in the case of tourism, because there is usually a long period between the decision to travel and the trip itself. This period of travel exploration and planning is used by tourist marketing companies to try to influence choices. This type of interaction also introduces a difference in the “spatiality” of the provision of tourist services, which are usually produced and consumed at the same time and in the same place, in a direct relationship between producer and consumer. The digitization of tourism anticipates most of these interactions and information flows and transfers them to large technological companies or marketing and distribution.
In a world where more and more travel, the routes are shorter and access to information is immense, how can countries and regions be competitive in the tourist offer?
Contemporary tourism lives in a highly competitive international environment. But just as there is a wide variety of destinations and offerings, there is also a wide range of preferences and consumption, what is called “hyper-personalization”, the result of such abundance of information and opportunity for interaction. The challenge that is placed on destinations is to identify the resources, products and services that can be adjusted to a particular group of consumers, to communicate effectively. This competitiveness greatly goes beyond the strict scope of tourist services because it also requires mobility and transportation services, varied infrastructure, safety, medical support, or easy communication. Anywhere you want to develop your tourist industry have to intervene about all these factors.
The book also addresses how “social processes” shape the development of tourism. In the case of China, for example, do you believe we are watching a change, which will have consequences for Macau?
It seems to me that Macau is in a highly privileged position to develop other forms of tourism. China is the largest issuing market in the world, the widespread rise of income in recent decades allows many million people to explore the opportunity to travel. Macao is a very close and distinct destination, with its historical and cultural particularities. For the Chinese population it was not easy to visit Macau and there is certainly a great interest.
How does the Great Bay project come in this?
The strategy that is being followed by integrating the Great Bay allows you to develop a cosmopolitan and diverse offer that can certainly attract Chinese tourists and other parts of the world. Moreover, these three areas have excellent hotel and tourism schools, which guarantee qualified personnel for tourism management and planning. The element of differentiation that Portuguese culture introduces in this context can certainly contribute to the success of the transition from a casinos focused on other forms that value culture and heritage more.
Is it possible to have sustainable tourism?
The problems and difficulties of tourism sustainability are more visible than in other sectors. This “spatiality” of tourism (where the consumer is obliged to move to the place of consumption) implies that the consequences of this consumption become more evident. These effects are less obvious when it comes to the unsustainability of industrial units or intensive forms of agriculture in relatively isolated areas. As mass reduction and investment reduction strategies also apply to tourism, the consequences of the environment or the quality of life of residents in destinations can be devastating. Sustainability implies a long -term perspective based on the idea that today's decisions do not imply future negative consequences. Sustainable practices depend on the control of the impacts that accumulate over time by individual and independent economic agents.
How can this control be done?
When a hotel or airline defines what ability to install on their services they may eventually estimate the impact that consumers will have on the local environment or economy. They will have more difficulties in anticipating that impacts will be generated in the next 10, 15 or 20 years to investment. And surely it will be impossible to measure how this impact accumulates the impacts caused by other service providers, now or in the future. In other words, although the idea of ​​sustainability is widespread accepted, economic agents do not have mechanisms or instruments in practice. Regulating the use of resources and territories by public entities with a more comprehensive and future perspective can contribute to the sustainability more effectively than the regulation associated with market dynamics, which in many cases has been revealed highly predatory. The Chinese economy is one of these examples and may eventually benefit from it.
And in the concrete case of Macau?
Macao has historically known problems: ultra-urbanized and polluted areas, with large energy consumption and waste production; Great concentration of tourists in a relatively small area of ​​great historical and cultural interest; Great dependence on the game, with the resulting imbalances in the appropriation of tourism benefits. The ongoing transition to new forms of tourism should better solve these problems and state regulation will certainly have better results than based on market dynamics.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:28:16</pubDate></item><item><title>José Paulo Esperança, Associate Rector of the City of Macau University: “Languages ​​cannot be controlled”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/01/jose-paulo-esperanca-reitor-associado-da-universidade-cidade-de-macau-as-linguas-nao-podem-ser-controladas/</link><description>Co-author of the “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, with Luís Reto and Fernando Luís Machado, José Paulo Esperança reveals to HM that the work edited in 2016 and 2018 is being updated, especially due to the growing global value of the language. The Associate Rector and Professor of the City of Macao University suggests partnerships with Macau under the Editorial Project
 
Launched the “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, in co-authorship, about the global value of the language. Plan a new edition or update?
Undoubtedly. We are working in this regard, there was a recent conference in Macao and Professor Luís Reto, former Rector of ISCTE, presented some more current elements that were developed. He has worked on a very important issue, which is the role of Portuguese as a frank language, which was for a few centuries in Asia. The exchange between Dutch and the kingdom of Zion was made in Portuguese, because it was the common language used at that time, before English became the contemporary frank language. Therefore, there is a whole interesting story of Portuguese and the role it had in the first pinyins that existed, with the Chinese and the use of the [Roman] alphabet in Vietname. There are a number of elements that are not, therefore, very publicized, and the work of Atlas is the same, to disclose some economic dimensions of the language.
What are these dimensions?
One is the exchange of foreign trade and investment, which is very facilitated by the language. We also talk about migrations, tourism, students' exchange that is greatly influenced by linguistic proximity. Therefore, today we have a set of elements that are very interesting, and we hope to develop some more important partnerships with Macau.
As?
More at work, Professor Luís Reto is doing, which maintains an investigation team about the value of Portuguese. He has collaborated with the Portuguese Language Museum of São Paulo, for example. It is a museum space that was renewed after the fire that destroyed it. In addition, there is a project with Cascais City Council to develop such a structure, and we hope to do some works with Macau, in order to create three poles for the projection of the Portuguese language. As for Atlas' materials, we would like to have a continued update model, as this data is out of date very quickly. The work was edited in many languages, including Mandarin. This is the moment when we would like to give the book a more historical and deep dimension, with more knowledge about the teaching of Portuguese in the world.
What balance does this teaching do today?
Portuguese is developing a great deal of mother tongue and is effectively one of the most expanding languages ​​due to demographic growth in Africa, with countries such as Angola and Mozambique, which around 2050 will have populations of over 100 million inhabitants, each. The Portuguese thus consolidates itself as a language of the southern hemisphere, but much more from Africa, supplanting Brazil itself as the place of largest number of speakers of the language. All of this generates enormous potential, and this also occurs due to the great exchange of universities and internationalization of teaching. Today there is the possibility of Portuguese being a language of science, there is more publications in this language. This is a great challenge because English is the contemporary language of scientists. We want to contribute to all these dimensions, and Macau can also play an important role there. Macao is indeed a platform between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, and can play a significant role.
Is Macao an ideal place to train Portuguese teachers who do not have Portuguese as a mother tongue? Do you fear that the territory loses relevance in this matter before the offer of courses in the interior of China?
I see this question more as complementarity than competition. We have identified about 60 higher education institutions in China that have Portuguese courses, but I think Macau has very interesting conditions to start teaching from primary to secondary education so that children have been able to have learning from an early age. It does not mean that there are no young Chinese who began to learn their tongue in adolescence that they speak fantastically, which surprises me, but it is easier to start earlier and earlier. This will be easier in Macau. What is important is to create conditions for greater economic collaboration to many levels, such as joint research. In this respect, Macau has a very interesting opportunity. At the City of Macau University we are very interested in increasingly collaborating with researchers who visit us and work with our teams.
Can you give me examples?
Brazil is today one of China's great business partners. There is a lot of exchange in both directions, but one of the themes that is little studied, and in which I work hard, is the internationalization of Chinese companies. To what extent do these companies follow a model of internationalization similar to that of other countries that started this process earlier? I speak of the United States of America, the European countries, but also of Japan and others. China has, in fact, different models of presence in countries that are not yet well known, and this is important to realize, so that we know how to facilitate this process of exchange in a world that lives periods of some setback. It is very sad. I always remember a great economist of Portuguese origin, David Ricardo, who clearly explained how world trade is beneficial to everyone and how countries can take advantage of this situation. Therefore, applying tariffs, making such commercial barriers harms countries that are major exporters, such as China or Germany, and countries that today have a cultural export capacity, for example, and are not just importers.
In relation to the new Orthographic Agreement. It continues without a standardization in Macau. Does it worry it?
Languages ​​are dynamic and cannot be controlled. We think today in English, and we realize that there are almost incomprehensible ways to each other, such as the English one in Nigeria or Australia. Americans have difficulty realizing the Australians. In the nineteenth century, Portuguese from Portugal and Brazil were closer, then some disagreement emerged. There was an effort in Brazil to propose an orthographic agreement, and the Portuguese joined, resulting in a series of negotiations. There have always been resistances. I remember that Fernando Pessoa suggested the famous phrase “My homeland is the Portuguese language”. It was curiously a manifestation of some conservatism, because he thought Pharmacy had to continue writing with pH [Pharmacia]. In fact it did not make much sense. Portugal ended up seeking to impose a certain standardization based on the most genetic changes in the spelling agreement. It is not a process that has been running a hundred percent well, and has been universally adopted. African countries have become more defenders of Portuguese from Portugal. There is sometimes some confusion, but I understand that intercomprehension still remains, achieving a homogeneous language, more perhaps than English.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP Macau | Fia introduces costly measure to GT world cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/21/gp-macau-fia-introduz-medida-onerosa-para-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) announced on Tuesday afternoon a technical measure for the GT3 cars participating in the GT World Cup of the Macao Grand Prix, which will certainly have an impact on a race that is the event's headlord
 
To improve the Balance of Performance (BOP) - the method that balances the progress between all cars in the GT3 category - the FIA ​​decided to force the use of torque sensors, like what you already do in their championships, such as resistance worlds (WEC) and Rally Raid or Formula E. Torque sensors offer a very high precision in power measurement, allowing FIA ensures that the power of each car does not exceed the values ​​assigned by BOP and that external factors, such as atmospheric conditions, do not influence performance.
Although Sro Motorsports Group is co-organizer of this race, and having a bop recognized worldwide, in the last two years, the Macao Bop has been provided by the FIA ​​itself. Last year, the FIA ​​BOP was worth a series of criticisms, with teams and pilots-particularly from Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, the main impaired-to publicly express their natural discontent with the difference in progress.
These sensors are installed in car transmission veins and represent the most effective tool for measuring wheel power, being individually attributed by the BOP process to each car model that participates in the world's most prestigious “sprint” race for GT3 class machines. According to FIA, the decision to make torque sensors mandatory after consultations with the brands involved in the GT3 technical working group.
Costs will shoot
For a race that has several private teams, this measure will be expensive, as these sensors exceed half a million patacas per car, and the teams need to have another same spare reserve system. This, given that most teams that participate in the MSar test do not use torque sensors in their cars in any competition, and cannot amortize the brutal investment.
"From the experience I had in Qatar, it is noted that there is a difference between several builders in the way it generates this technology. An extra support team is needed to monitor and maximize performance without exceeding the stipulated limits," he told HM Duarte Alves, the experienced track engineer in the territory who was with the official Ford team in the first WEC season in the Arab country.
"A good example is the difficulty and time needed for a builder who enters as a newcomer. An illustrative case is Mercedes-AMG, which is facing growth pains while developing its own systems," said Duarte Alves. “In more flat circuits, the management of these systems is simpler. In places like Macau, where 'torque peaks' will always be frequent, it will be a real challenge for the engineers of these systems!”
Confident
Immune to all this, the FIA ​​chooses a speech directed to builders, forgetting that most of the starting grid is made up of private competitors.
Lutz Leif Linden, chairman of the FIA ​​GT commission, said the institution that represents “made this decision in consultation with the builders”, adding that, to the international federation, “this means even more justice and improved control of BOP values, which is particularly important in such a prestigious and media event, in such a demanding circuit, where the long -speed straight lines contrast with tight curves and narrow ”.
Fabrice Van Ertvede, FIA speed technical manager, stressed the idea that "our goal, as a regulatory entity, is to ensure total equity for all participants." The implementation of torque sensors “is an extremely effective tool for achieving this goal, allowing us to align very different cars in parameters such as pure power, but also at full speed, a crucial factor in a circuit like the guide circuit.”
Despite the difficulties that Mercedes-AMG encountered this system last month, Fabrice Van Ertvede praises that “the builders we hope to see in Macau this year are already familiar with this innovation through their experience in the FIA's LMGT3 LMGT3 class, and the decision to adopt torque sensors resulted from the dialogue we kept with them.”
This is the second news that the FIA ​​introduces in the mashed race, having announced last month that the second qualification segment will have a super pole format, with each pilot to go to the track individually for a total of two qualification laps. The eighth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup will take place from November 13 to 16, as part of the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-03-21 17:11:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Iame Asia finals of Karting back in December</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/11/finais-da-iame-asia-de-karting-voltam-em-dezembro/</link><description>The Macao Karting International Award will receive again, from December 11 to 14, the Iame Asian finals. Like last year, the coloane karting race will give invitations to the very coveted world end of Iame in 2026.
Organized by the Institute of Sport, Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC), Otk Kart Asia and Iame Asia, the 2024 event brought back the international spirit to one of the largest competitions of the sport on the Asian continent. Coloane's karting received several races and different categories of Iame Series Asia, recovering the international prestige of an event that has been the scene of the Cik-Fia World Championship events.
Pilots from the interior of China, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Italy, France, Austria, the United States of America, Brazil, Hong Kong, and, of course, Macao, filled the track from the mashes in 2024 for four days of intense Competition, something that has not been seen for several years.
After the success of the previous edition, the formula is repeated this year. Singapore's organization again chooses Coloane's karting for its biggest event of the season, confirming the presence of the usual categories: Cadet, Junior, Senior and Master.
Thank you Macau!
The Iame (Italian American Motor Engineering) is one of the world's leading engine manufacturers for Karting. Founded in 1968 by Bruno Grana, the company is headquartered in Italy and is one of the references in Karting Internacional, having bet strongly in the Asian market in recent years. The presence in Macau is part of this strategy of growth and expansion.
The announcement of the return to the territory was made on social networks: “After an incredible debut in 2024, we are back with the Macao International International Prize and the Iame Asia final for another epic confrontation! The city of emotions at high speed and legendary races will be the stage for the best pilots in Asia and everyone!
Satisfied with the reception in 2024, Iame Asia organizers took the opportunity to leave a "huge thanks to AAMC and the Macao government for their continuous support and confidence to make it possible!"
In addition to the Macao test, the 2025 calendar of Iame Series Asia includes three events in Malaysia and three events in Thailand. However, for the first time, last weekend of March, the Iame Asia Cup will be held at the International Shanghai Circuit Karting.</description><pubDate>2025-03-11 01:04:32</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Leong repeats Lamborghini trophy with Theodore</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/02/automobilismo-leong-repete-trofeu-lamborghini-com-a-theodore/</link><description>The Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia starts this weekend in Australia. The monomocrete competition of the prestigious super -sports builder will have, once again, with a representation of the MSAR. Charles Leong Hon Chio will be again at the service of SJM Theodore Racing.
After last season Charles Leong and SJM Theodore Racing fought for the Pro class title to the last race, this duo will continue in 2025. However, the winner of the Macao 4 Grand Prix of Formula 4 by 2020 and 2021 will not form a team with Japanese Miki Koyama. Beside his side, the Macau pilot will now have young Irish Alex Denning, who last year competed at the European Series GT4 and will make his debut on Asian tracks.
Also new is in the SJM Care Team Theodore Racing, which is no longer Iron Lynx-a structure that, since 2021, controls Prema Powertaam ​​through Swiss company DC Racing Solutions Ltd. The relationship of Iron Lynx with Lamborghini Squadra Corso, an entity responsible for the Italian brand, deteriorated dramatically at the end of last year Due to a conflict related to the FIA ​​Endurance World Championship program (WEC). As a result, Iron Lynx has abandoned all activities with the brand of Sant'Agata Bolognese globally.
Given this scenario, to ensure technical assistance to its Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo Evo 2, SJM Theodore Racing will feature this season with the services of DW Evans GT, the team that, last year, won the Team Championship and the Asian trophy class, with the English-based English and co-owner of the team, Dan Wells.
There is no coincidence with the GP
The Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia intends to keep its momentum by 2025, with a calendar composed of six events in six different countries. The season will start, for the first time, in Australia, with the historic Sydney Motorsport Park to receive the first double round. Then the competition heads for Shanghai, China, for the second round on the weekend from June 16 to 18, marking its return to the calendar in 2024 after a four -year absence. Japan will be the host of the third round two weeks later, at the iconic Fuji track, while the Inje Speedium in South Korea enters the calendar in late July.
After having previously hosted the opening round of the season, Sepang, Malaysia, passes to September in 2025, occupying the fifth round of the calendar. The sixth and last race will take place at the Misano Circuit in Italy, together with the Lamborghini world finals. For the first time in several years, the event will not coincide with the Macao Grand Prix, competing in the previous weekend.
Absence of figure
Pro--class winner in 2024, along with Chinese Jason Fangping Chen, André Couto will not be present in this year's edition of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia. Madness Racing Team, whereby the Portuguese territory pilot competed last season, abandoned the trophy and has not yet defined his sports project for 2025. For this first race in the championship in Australia, there are twenty -three cars that will be driven by thirty -nine pilots.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:01:40</pubDate></item><item><title>FIRST RALENT PROOF FOR THE MACAU GP took place in Shanghai</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/25/primeira-prova-de-apuramento-para-o-gp-macau-decorreu-em-xangai/</link><description>The first determination test for the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix took place last weekend at the International Shanghai Circuit. Integrated in the Formula 1 China Grand Prix Program, Chen Weian and Lichao Han won the two races that will serve to select competitors entitled to participate this year in the GT - Great Bay Cup -
 
The GT Cup-Great Bay Race joined the newly created SRO GT Cup, the latest GT competition launched in the interior of China, inspired by the GT4 class vehicles of the Macao Grand Prix. Thirty-three cars, six of them driven by Macau pilots, signed up for this debut-a record number of participants in a GT4 category in Asia category.
According to the organizer's statement, Sro Motorsports Group, “the total number of cars and the variety of builders have even exceeded the organizers' expectations for a championship that only began to be discussed in late November 2024. Since then, the Sro Asia team and their partner AAMC (Macau-China General Automobile Association) have worked tirelessly to make the series a reality before their debut.”
The event started in a troubled way. Due to a customs problem that affected several cars, more than a dozen competitors was unable to participate in the free training session on Friday. Fortunately, for this group of pilots, among which were included the pilots of the Kevin Leong Ian Veng, Kim Hou Lao and Un HA IP, the cars arrived at the circuit in time for Saturday's qualification.
Animated races and decision in Zhuhai
With three dozen cars, from ten different brands, on track, all with very balanced tasks, was attended by two animated races in the imposing Shanghai track. In the first 12 -lap race, the two Lotus Emi GT4 Officials, by Daniel Lu and Luo Kailuo, who departed from the first line of the grill, were overcome on track by the Chen Weian Audi R8 LMS GT4. In the second match of the weekend, Lichao Han, behind the wheel of the same Toyota GR GT4 who beat the GT Cup - Great Bay Race in 2024, triumphed ahead of Chen Weian and Lotus de Liu Kai Shun.
Macao pilots had no easy life on a track where they had little or no experience. The most rewarded of all, Kelvin Leong, abandoned in the second round of the first race, while Miguel Law, in Audi R8 LMS GT4, was the best of the riders of MSAR, ending in 19th place. In Sunday's race, Leong took his BMW M4 GT4 F82 to 11th place.
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, at the end of the season, on the streets of Macau. The places will be attributed based on the classification after the second round of the championship, scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit, in a date yet to be announced.</description><pubDate>2025-03-25 01:20:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Return to GIC | Local tests return to Zhaoqing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/10/regresso-ao-gic-provas-locais-voltam-a-zhaoqing/</link><description>The dates for the Macao of Tourism Car Championship (MTCs in the English acronym) were made known on the past Friday by the General Automóvel Association of Macau-China (AAMC) through a newsletter. The competition for local pilots and decides to find out the Macao Grand Prix in November will again return to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC).
After a year when the MTCS headed to the Zhuzhou International Circuit in Hunan province, AAMC listened to most of the territory pilots and chose to make these important races closer to the main interveners' house - the pilots. In recent years, the circuit of the surroundings of Zhaoqing has been the preferred stage for the realization of these races, due to the proximity and the fact that it serves as an operational basis to most teams.
The first of the two events scheduled for the 2025 MTCS is scheduled from 18 to 20 April, while the second round is scheduled from 16 to 18 May. The AAMC newsletter says that "all riders must go through a selection process before they can participate in the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix - Macau Touring Car Challenge."
Registration, for the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8), are open until March 29 and after the end of the registration period, "all applications will be subject to AAMC approval, which reserves the final right to accept or reject any registration."
The technical regulation was also published, as was officially confirmed the use of tires of the Italian brand Pirelli, which belongs to the Chinese conglomerate Sinochem, as had already happened on the last edition of the Macao Grand Prix.
Confirmation of the Great Bay
AAMC also confirmed the two findings for the GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4), which will be concomitant with the new Chinese Championship Sro GT Cup. The first race will be played from March 21 to 23, at the International Circuit of Shanghai, in the Formula 1 China Grand Prix. Zhuhai International. Also here Pirelli will be the only tire supplier.
These two tests will be determined for the big holiday party on the guide circuit, and it is defined that only 28 cars will be accepted on the starting grid in the mashed race. The 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix runs from November 13 to 16.</description><pubDate>2025-03-10 04:17:32</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | FIA confirms GT World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/gp-macau-fia-confirma-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>The World Council of the FIA ​​last Wednesday confirmed the expected, that the eighth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup will be held as part of the Macao's 72nd Grand Program, from November 13 to 16. However, there is a big news for this year's edition
 
The International Federation, which co-organizes this race in partnership with Sro Motorsports Group and the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), took the opportunity to announce a new qualification model for the race. In addition to the 30 -minute qualification session equal to the previous editions (Q1), a second qualification segment (Q2) was added, reserved for the top ten pilots of the first session.
The Q2 session will be held in Super Pole format, with each pilot to go to the track individually for a total of two qualification turns, and each pilot is also allowed to use a new tire set at this session. This novelty will allow qualification to be decided without interference from third parties.
The remaining program of the Queen of GT will remain the same as the previous editions, with the free training session, the traditional 12-lap classification race on Saturday afternoon, followed by the 16-lap main race that will decide the world's Cup winner on Sunday.
Veterans compliments
These measures introduced by the FIA ​​were very well received by the most experienced GT riders. This is because traffic has always been a huge obstacle in obtaining a good qualification return on the guide circuit, something essential for those who aim to win this title.
"It's an excellent idea to introduce the Super Pole session in Macao," said German Maro Engel, the winner of the World Cup last edition by Mercedes-AMG. This will be one of the most spectacular and exciting sessions of the season and should also secure sports justice.
Raffaele Marciello, for two occasions winning of this trophy, and one of the BMW factory riders, also reacted positively, adding: “In Macao, it was always complicated to make a clean lap. With this new format, you will not hear the excuse of traffic or a red flag. Having only two laps will be very challenging, but now the fastest pilot will probably be in pole.”
This is an opinion shared by Laurens Vanthoor, the World Cup winner in 2016, who said there will no longer be “apologies” in the qualification. Porsche's experienced Belgian pilot believes that “there will be an added pressure because you only have these two turns”, because in a difficult circuit like this, “if you make an error, there is nothing more to follow. In a normal qualification, you have more opportunities. Personally, a shootout is always something that I appreciate a lot. For pilots like this, it will be almost the highlight of the weekend.”
And the younger ones too
Chinese pilot Yifei Ye premiered at the Grand Prix last November at the World Cup. Ferrari's official pilot, which competes in the Endurance Fia World Championship (WEC), has left a good impression on the guide circuit, and he also welcomes the now introduced measurements.
“It's good to eliminate these red flag interventions and yellow flags, so that in the end, the one that really is the fastest to get pole position,” said Yifei Ye that she could return to the race this year. "In Macao, everyone is very close in terms of times, so it will be extremely difficult for pilots to try to get to 'Super Pole'. I think it will also be great for viewers."</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 01:03:51</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
