The Senior Officials Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) announced that it has transferred the case to the Public Prosecutor's Office, which has the power to formally charge a South Korean head of state.
The CIO considers that Yoon conspired with the then Minister of National Defense, Kim Yong-hyun, and other military officers to start a mutiny, declaring martial law on the night of December 3rd. It further argues that Yoon abused his power by sending troops to the National Assembly (parliament) to prevent deputies from revoking martial law.
The Public Prosecution Service now has 11 days to decide whether or not to start the requested process. If Yoon is considered guilty of leading an insurrection, a crime for which a president has no immunity in the country, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment or the death penalty.
Yoon has been in pre-trial detention at the Seoul Detention Center, in Uiwang, south of Seoul, since January 15. The Constitutional Court is simultaneously holding a trial to determine whether or not to ratify the dismissal approved by parliamentarians on December 14th.
If the highest court in South Korea confirms the impeachment, early presidential elections have to be called within 60 days after the court decision. Yoon refuses to witness in the investigation into the alleged crime of rebellion.
Yoon Suk-Youol surprised the country on December 3 by declaring martial law, a measure reminiscent of black days of the South Korean military dictatorship and that justified with the intention of protecting the country from “North Korean Communist forces” and “Eliminate elements hostile to the state”.
Pressured by the deputies and thousands of protesters, Yoon was forced to revoke the decision hours later.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:30:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Competitions | Deputies discussed “competitive negotiation”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/concursos-deputados-discutiram-negociacao-competitiva/</link><description>The possibility of Public Administration representatives directly negotiating public tender proposals with candidates was discussed yesterday in the 1st Permanent Committee of the Legislative Assembly.

The lunar new year of the serpent starts next Wednesday and, once again, opens a period of holidays that will bring many tourists to Macao. According to the assistant professor at the University of Macao (one) Glenn McCartney, holidays associated with Chinese New Year will be important to “measure and evaluate the interest and game -related expenses, as well as regional visits, given the investment in events at the city's scale and the expected large number of visitors, ”he told HM.
“From a business point of view, the fundamental question is how the number of visitors translates into actual expenses and the impact this brings to small and medium-sized businesses, such as restaurants, bars and shops, whether they are overnight visitors or of day-trippers returning to Hong Kong or Zhuhai on the same day.”
Thus, “there are expectations that the occupancy rate of Macau hotels will be high, and there will be some visitors of a day who will return to be in Zhuhai,” he estimated.
More than a million
Since in the same year's same year, the territory received almost 1.4 million tourists during the 8 -day Chinese New Year, it is expected for the coming days “a high number of visitors”, “like this year The Chinese New Year begins on January 29, Macau may benefit from the increase in the number of tourists in the previous and later weekends. ”
But Glenn McCartney also highlights other factors that can enhance tourism numbers, “since we have watched greater accessibility and ease of border passage as an important factor since reopening after Covid, for example, with the increase of visitors of Hong Kong through the bridge. ”
Glenn Mccartney also argues that the resorts' promotional activities and street festivities can also attract tourists, with “an important feature of Chinese New Year activities being the 'feedback' component”, with “residents and visitors being able to give their opinion, allowing authorities to understand the impact of these Chinese New Year activities.”
“This type of feedback can be a valuable source to improve various aspects of Chinese New Year's organization, operations and marketing in order to analyze current and potential visitors in the future. The use of networks can be part of the impact analysis assessment of Chinese New Year's promotions, ”he said.
For these days Helena de Senna Fernandes, director of tourism services, said she expects a daily average of 185,000 visitors, of which only eight thousand should be international. The main attraction during this period in Macau will be the Lunar New Year's stop, held on January 31 and repeated on February 8.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:50:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Press | Sam Hou Fai highlights diversity and internationalization</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/imprensa-sam-hou-fai-frisa-diversidade-e-internacionalizacao/</link><description>The message was left by the chief executive during the dinner offered to the media in Portuguese and English.

The government leader also indicated that “freedom of the press is fully guaranteed by the Basic Law and the Macao SAR Press Law, which is why it will be safeguarded, as always and in accordance with the law, by the Macao SAR Government, which will support the sector in the correct fulfillment of its duties, in news coverage and access to news, actively collaborating in the efficient exchange of information between the various public services and the sector”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:47:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Work | East Asia with low work satisfaction and demotivation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/trabalho-asia-oriental-com-baixa-satisfacao-laboral-e-desmotivacao/</link><description>The global labor outlook report, by the International Gallup Association, concluded that in countries and regions in East Asia, such as China, Taiwan or Hong Kong, the majority of workers are looking for a new job. In Hong Kong, only six percent of respondents are committed to their jobs
 
Understanding how workers around the world feel in the workplace, and in relation to the job they have, is the objective of the International Gallup Association report, entitled “State of the Global Workplace 2024”. If on a global and regional level East Asia does well in some indicators, the scenario is not at all favorable with regard to the commitment or commitment that workers have for the company they are linked to or for the functions they perform.
Inside East Asia includes countries and regions such as China, Hong Kong, Japan, Mongolia, South Korea and Taiwan. This area of ​​the globe has “the lowest percentage, at regional level, of employees who feel daily sadness”, but has “the third highest, regional percentage of employees who say they are looking, and actively, of a new job. ” In addition, East Asia has “the third lower percentage at regional level of committed employees” with the work they have (18 percent, which still represents a rise of 1 percent compared to the corresponding period between 2022 and 2023) .

As for negative emotions lived daily, and more often, the stress factor leads, with 46 percent response, six percent from the period between 2022 and 2023. percent answers, which did not generate any answers in the last investigation. “Sadness” was a feeling revealed by 12 percent of respondents, 1 more percent compared to the previous inquiry, and “loneliness”, which also has direct entry into this list of less good feelings lived at work, 18 percent.
If dissatisfaction with work is demonstrated in the preceding paragraphs, certainties climb from tone in the category “work environment - good height to find a job”, with 51 percent to respond affirmatively, 11 percent of answers to the previous inquiry . In addition, the category “intention to leave - looking actively for a new work” was chosen for 54 percent of respondents, two percent less from 2022 to 2023.
In the “Life Assessment” category, those who claim to have a prosperous life are 32 percent, seven percent, in contrast to the 62 percent of respondents who claim to be suffering some kind of difficulties, another seven percent in relation to to the last inquiry. The “suffering” category related to the job was chosen for six percent of participants in the inquiry, a direct entry in this study.
Sadness below
For the Gallup study, 40,428 people were interviewed in 41 countries, with the country sample containing around 1,000 men and women. The poll's margin of error “is between +3-5 percent with a 95 percent confidence level”, it is said.
The study also compares data recorded by workers in East Asia with other countries. And once again, the lack of commitment and the feeling of “wearing the shirt” that persists in many companies is evident. In global terms, 62 percent of responses point to a lack of commitment, while in East Asia this percentage rises to 67 percent.
Regarding “Life Assessment”, if worldwide 58 percent of respondents say they are experiencing difficulties, the percentage in East Asia is 62 percent. However, the suffering felt is only in six percent of the responses, while worldwide the bar is eight percent. In relation to this factor, the low percentage of the feeling of “daily sadness” stands out, with 12 percent of responses, when worldwide the bar rises to 22 percent.
The feeling of “stress” is also higher, with 46 percent of responses, compared to 41 percent overall.
China: anger and difficulties
Looking at the criteria in each country, 19 percent of China workers said they were committed to work, two more percent annually, while in Hong Kong only six percent of people are committed and who like what they do, the which is a break of one percent.
In the “life assessment”, 36 percent of China workers say they are facing difficulties, plus 1 percent, while in Taiwan 41 percent says they face less good times, representing a direct entry into the classification, with no previous score to compare. In the case of Hong Kong, 17 percent of respondents assume to cross difficulties, more 1 percent compared to the previous inquiry.
Regarding the feeling of “daily stress”, China rises to first place in the ranking with 53 percent of responses, still 2 percent less in annual terms, with Hong Kong following in its footsteps, with 49 percent of responses. . Japan is in third place with 41 percent of people experiencing stress daily.

In China only 12 percent of workers said they felt sadness, thus putting the country in third place. In relation to Hong Kong there were 11 percent affirmative responses in this domain.
Jon Clinfton, CEO of Gallup, warns about the increase in mental health problems around the world, especially related to the workplace and relationships in business. Around 20 percent of workers around the world “experience daily loneliness”, and this feeling “is greater among workers who are fully teleworking”.
“In this year’s report, 41 percent of workers say they feel ‘a lot of stress’. However, stress varies significantly depending on the way organizations are managed. Those who work in companies with bad management practices (actively unmotivated) are almost 60 percent more likely to be stressed than people who work in environments with good management practices (committed). In fact, the experience of ‘a lot of stress’ is reported about 30 percent more often by employees working under poor management than by the unemployed,” said the Gallup CEO.
For him, “leaders know that stress in the workplace is a problem – they have seen the data, listened to colleagues and felt it themselves”. “A quarter of leaders feel burned out often or always, and two-thirds feel it at least sometimes. Many are trying to solve the problem, but often ineffectively”, he concludes.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:41:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Investigators ask South Korean MP to charge deposed leader with insurrection</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/investigadores-pedem-ao-mp-sul-coreano-que-acuse-de-insurreicao-lider-deposto/</link><description>South Korea's anti-corruption office yesterday recommended to the Public Prosecutor's Office that deposed President Yoon Suk-yeol be charged with rebellion and abuse of power for declaring martial law in December.

On February 2nd, the show “SJM A-Lin Music Show” will also take place at the Grand Pavilion of the Grand Lisboa Palace. A-Lin is the singer who won the “Golden Melody Awards”, bringing “her powerful voice and emotional ballads to Macau to celebrate the Lunar New Year”.
Party bar
In the Barra zone, MGM promotes the “Barra da Barra Mercado da Barra”, located in the old slaughterhouse, which includes a solo exhibition by Japanese illustrator Shinri Murakami, who “presents his fashion illustrations in a creative cross between art and retail ”, This show complemented with a“ pop-up coffee ”, with themed products.
Quoted in a statement, Shinri Murakami said it was an “honor to present works of art in such a historically rich space”. “The fusion of heritage and modernity in this neighborhood is truly inspiring. Together, we created an innovative shared space where my art goes beyond traditional exhibitions, connecting with various activities and integrating into the daily life of Macau”, he said.
For the organization, this market and other events “combine elements such as Chinese intangible cultural heritage, fashion illustrations, a Chinese New Year's creative market and live music”, being a “unique convergence of tradition and modernity”. Since January 26, this market is open to the public in Barra.
It is also worth mentioning the holding, on the 1st and 2nd of February, of the symphonic concert “Black Myth: Wukong”, at the MGM Theatre. This show will feature “a bold crossover between music and game that combines symphonic music and traditional Chinese music”, with the reproduction of several short animated films during the show “to allow the audience to immerse themselves in the world of mythology oriental” brought by the game “Black Myth: Wukong”, a well-known Chinese video game. This show also aims to “introduce the public to China’s thriving gaming industry and the depth of its traditional culture”.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said yesterday at a press conference that Beijing is “deeply shocked” with the attack. "China is against all forms of terrorism," said the spokesman, appealing to the "repression of the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations listed by the UN Security Council."
“China will continue to pay close attention to the security situation in Afghanistan and support the Afghan authorities in combating all forms of terrorist violence and maintaining security and stability in the country,” Mao added, urging the Afghan government to take necessary measures “to ensure the security of Chinese citizens and organizations in the country”.
According to local police, the victim worked in a gold mine in the region, which borders Tajiquistan. A local branch of the Islamic State Islamic Group claimed the authorship of the attack. China is one of the few international actors that has maintained diplomatic relations with Afghanistan since the Taliban reached power in August 2021.
The two countries share a small international border of just 76 kilometers in the easternmost part of the so-called Wajan Corridor, a remote pass in the Pamir mountain range.
Chinese companies, with the support of Beijing, have sought to take advantage of opportunities to explore the vast deposits of non -developed resources from Afghanistan, especially Mes Aynak Mine, which is believed to contain the largest copper deposit in the world.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:18:39</pubDate></item><item><title>ICBC | Bank tries to collect Alvin Chau's debt</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/icbc-banco-tenta-cobrar-divida-de-alvin-chau/</link><description>The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC, in English) is executing housing for businessman Alvin Chau, who is currently detained at the Coloane Prison.

Goethe, who was always passionate about Chinese civilization, glossed the ancient principle of Socrates, the Greek, “the more I know, the more I know that I know nothing” and wrote “Man only knows when he knows that he knows little. With knowledge, doubt grows.” And Confucius 孔夫子, who also knew a lot about life and his people, said, six centuries before Christ: “If you know, act as a man who knows. If you don't know, recognize that you don't know; That’s knowing!”
The old Chinese, a wisdom based on five thousand years of history and stories are wise. The old Chinese, an intelligence acquired over many and many centuries hard and intensely lived, are intelligent.
Lao Zi, 老子 (600 a.
Under Heaven,[1] we all see that beauty is beautiful
because the ugly exists.
We all know that the good is good
because evil exists.
Being and non-being coexist,
complete the difficult and the easy
the high and the low come closer,
voice and sound harmonize,
The front and the back follow one another.
Therefore, the sage advances and does nothing, [2]
teaches without saying anything
And the ten thousand beings develop without ceasing.
He works and has nothing,
He creates and appropriates nothing.
Everything done, everything forgets,
thus, forever, the work remains.[3]
The amazing Lie Zi 列子 (450 BC-376 BC) who, according to Taoist tradition, was capable of riding winds and clouds, says, in his Book, chap. II, 11:
“Two boys lived by the sea and loved the seagulls. Every morning they played in the middle of the birds and many other seagulls, to the hundreds, poisted with them. One day the father told them:
‘I know they play with seagulls. Collect some and bring them back. I also want to have fun.’
The next day, the boys arrived at the seashore, the seagulls hovered in the air and did not land on the beach.
In conclusion, the best of all discourses is the one that does not use words, the perfect action is to act without acting, the wisdom of the wisest of the wise is always unknown ”
Another story of the book of Lie Zi, in Chapter VII, 32:
“A peasant didn't know where his ax was. He then suspected that his neighbor's son had stolen and began to watch the boy carefully. He had exactly the modes of a thief of axes, the words he pronounced sounded the thief with axes, all his behavior and attitudes were those of someone who had stolen an ax.
But suddenly, digging the earth, the peasant found his ax.
The next day the man looked again at the neighbor's son. He then noticed that the modes, words, behavior, and attitudes of the boy were by no means of those of a thief with axes. ”
Chinese wisdom has almost always escaped Western intelligence. West and East hardly interpenetrate, they look at the Sobrency, sometimes with distrust, and above all ignore.
I will mention a curious recent example:
In 1970, in his “final will,” Russian Nikita Kruchtchev wrote, about Mao Zedong: “I was never sure to understand what he meant. He thought, at that time, that this was related to certain aspects of the Chinese mindset and the way of thinking of the Chinese. Some statements of Mao shocked me for its simplicity, others for its complexity. I never knew safely what Mao's position. It is impossible, with the Chinese, to know in which law. ”
It is true that Russian thinking and Chinese thinking are not understood, always. The Sino-Soviet conflict, which began in the late fifty years, was, beyond political differences, a confrontation of cultures and, strange to appear in two communist countries, a conflict between various, different conceptions of the world.
A few years ago, in Beijing, my friend Li Shunbao, a co-worker at the Beijing Editions in Foreign Languages, told me about a small dialogue that took place in 1961 between Khrushchev and Zhou Enlai, then first- Chinese minister. Relations between the two countries were already quite bad and, after a bitter discussion about political issues, Khrushchev decided to be “nice” to Zhou Enlai and told him:
“Despite our differences, we have a lot in common. We both believe in Marxism, you are Prime Minister, so am I, and you and I are responsible for the Government of two of the greatest nations in the world. But there is a big difference between us, I am the son of peasants and you are the son of mandarins.”
Zhou Enlai, who, in fact, was not the son but the grandson of a mandarin, smiled and replied: “Sorry, that's not a difference, it's more of a similarity. It means we are both traitors.” “Traitors?!…How?…” asked Khrushchev. “Well, both traitors because you betrayed the peasants and I betrayed the mandarins.”
Regarding politics and politicians, the philosopher Han Feizi 韓非子 wrote 240 years before the birth of Christ:
“You can generally expect about ten honest men in each kingdom, which is an excellent average. But the state must count a hundred positions. Hence there is more official than good men to occupy them, which gives ten honest men and ninety rascals to fill all these places. It can therefore be betting that the result will be widespread disorder, more than an organized government. This is why the sensible sovereign believes in a system and not in individual abilities, has faith in a method and suspects personal probity. ”
Han Feizi was the greatest theoretician of the Fa Jia 法家 school, known in the West as Legism. He would die of poisoning in prison, perhaps because he had forgotten one of Confucius' exemplary quotes: “the honest man tells the truth, the fool tells the whole truth.” In any case, his principles would exert great influence on modern China and on Mao Zedong himself.
Zhuang Zi 庄子(369-286 B.C.), the greatest of Taoist thinkers, one of the great poets of freedom, tells us this story:
“Zhuang Zi was fishing on the river bank when two mandarins sent by the Prince of Zhou arrived next to him.
-Our prince wants to see you and appoint you Prime Minister of Kingdom of Zhou.
Zhuang Zi continued to fish and, without turning his head, replied:
—I heard that in the Kingdom of Zhou there is a sacred turtle that was killed many, many years ago. The prince keeps this turtle closed in the temple of his ancestors and venerates its shell. Now would the turtle prefer to be dead and have its remains venerated, or would it prefer to be alive, wagging its tail in the mud of the swamps?
— I would prefer to be alive, wagging my tail in the mud of the swamps, replied the mandarins.
— You can leave, said Zhuang Zi. I also prefer to wag my tail in the mud of the swamps.”
In China, more than in any other country in the world, we see how, century after century, the continuity of ideas, traditions, uses and customs manifests itself.
Mao Zedong, who knew well the cultural foundation of his homeland, sometimes cited the old philosophers and the stories of popular tradition, for the benefit of the ideology he defended. This is how, in 1945, Mao speaks of one of these stories:
“In Ancient China there was a fable titled ‘How Yukong Removed the Mountains’. This fable tells that, in times long ago, an old man named Yukong lived in northern China. On the south side, in front of his house, there were two large mountains, Taihang and Wangwu, which blocked his way. Leading his children, Yukong decided to level the mountains with a pickaxe. Seeing them at such work, another old man named Chezou burst out laughing and said to them: 'How foolish! Alone, you will never be able to demolish these two mountains’. Yukong replied:
‘When I die, my children will remain; When, in turn, they die, my grandchildren will remain, and so generations will continue uninterruptedly. As for these two mountains, no matter how high they are, they can no longer grow any further and, with each blow of the pickaxe, they become smaller. Why can't we raze them?' And Yukong continued, unwavering, to cut the stone, day after day, which moved the god of heaven who sent two angels to Earth who carried and carried the two mountains. Today there are also two mountains that weigh on the Chinese people: imperialism and feudalism. The Communist Party of China has long since decided to destroy them. We must be persevering and work tirelessly, as we can also move the god of heaven. For us, the god of heaven is none other than the mass of the Chinese people.”
One of the characteristics of Chinese thinking is the unity of opposites, the complementarity and permanent transformation of opposites, movement and dialectic, the nullity of contradictions and the immediate appearance of renewed contradictions always insoluble because, when solved, they give rise to other new contradictions.
In the twenty years of the twentieth century, the philosopher Chen Lifu 陳立夫 wrote things like these:
“As men do not look like, their analogies are characterized by seven periods. In the first, the strong tolerates the weak; In the second, the strong despises the weak; In the third, the strong enslaves the weak; In the room, the strong has piety of the weak; In the fifth, the fort becomes weak; In the sixth, the weak protects the fort; In the seventh, the weak and the strong are confused. ”
Returning to Zhuang Zi and his edifice of Taoist wisdom, twenty-three centuries old, we read:
“The universe as such is not an expression of the absolute. Everything changes, over time, in the course of evolution, according to what begins and what ends. Science teaches that things change appearance and that the absolute becomes relative. Therefore, the distance between big and small is blurred, between what comes before and what comes after in a chain that has no end.”
And later, in his book by Zhuang Zi, the master says:
“Those who claim to exist the right and the righteous without their correlative, the incorrect and the unfair, or the good government without their correlative, the bad government, do not understand the great principles of the universe or the essence of all creation. How can we speak of the existence of heaven without referring to the existence of the earth, or the negative principle without referring to the positive principle?
However, there are still people who continue these endless discussions. These people are either crazy or naive. ”
The apparent statism of oriental civilizations has much to do with the cyclical character of their thinking. Also with his wisdom, quite different from our Western, so linked to the old Greek logic and the apparent Judeo-Christian dynamism.
Here is another very ancient story of Chinese Taoism, now taken from Huainanzi 淮南子, a classic of Chinese philosophy dating back to the 2nd century BC:
“A poor old peasant had a horse and the animal ran away. At night, the neighbors came to express their condolences, telling him that he had had very bad luck. The peasant simply replied: ‘Maybe’. The next day, the horse returned accompanied by six wild mares. At night, the neighbors came to congratulate the peasant, telling him that he had been very lucky after all. The man simply replied: ‘Maybe’. The next day, the peasant's son rode one of the wild mares, but fell and broke his leg. At night, the neighbors came to lament the peasant's bad luck and he simply replied: 'Maybe'. The next day, government officials responsible for recruiting young people for the army arrived in the village, finding the empire in time of war. The peasant's son didn't go to the battlefield because he had a broken leg. In the evening, the neighbors came to congratulate him once again on his good luck and the old man simply replied: 'Maybe.'
Now an old apologist, by Pe Yu king, who no one knows but which was written fourteen centuries ago:
“Once a monk, a bandit, a painter, a miser, and a wise man traveled together. He fell at night and housed in a cave.
"There would be no better place for an hermitage," the monk exclaimed.
— What a great refuge for robbers, said the bandit.
- The light of the dock, these shadow games, which extraordinary motives for the brush!, The painter murmured in turn.
—What an excellent place to hide treasure!, observed the miser.
The sage heard in silence and finally said:
— What a wonderful cave!”
In China never is nothing exactly what it seems. It may be, it may not be, it all depends on subtles or cancellations of each person, perspective, look. In the sixteenth century, in the middle of Ming Dynasty, the literate Yuan Jing 袁 晶 told the interesting story of a cat. Like this:
A mandarin of the court, named Ji, had a magnificent cat. He was so proud of the feline that he decided to call him tiger. One day, they will not be in their home with several friends, everyone started talking about the cat. One of them said:
–It is true that the Tiger is a powerful animal, but the Dragon has even more power. Why not call the cat Dragon?
Another intervened:
–I admit that the Dragon is more powerful than the Tiger, but he has to rise into the air to reach the clouds. It therefore seems clear to me that the clouds are stronger than the dragon. Why not call the cat Cloud?
A third then said:
"The clouds can cover the whole earth, but they can't resist the wind that disperses them quickly." Why not call the cat wind?
A bedroom coexistence added:
- What can the wind before a stone wall. Why not call a wall to the cat?
A fifth friend argued later:
- A wall can resist the wind, but rats know how to bump a wall. Why not call a rat to the cat?
An old man from Dongli village listened to the entire conversation silently. Finally, he asked:
- What is the animal that hunts rats called?
Our João de Barros (1496-1570), an excellent sixteenth-century chronicler, in his Asia, Third Decade, which contains more than a hundred pages dedicated to China and the Chinese world, wrote around 1550:
"The Chins say they have two eyes of understanding the casters of all the things, we, the ones in Europe, after communicating us, have an eye, and all the other nations are blind."

-Our prince wants to see you and appoint you Prime Minister of Kingdom of Zhou.
Zhuang Zi continued to fish and, without going back to his head, replied:
"I heard that in the kingdom of Zhou there is a sacred turtle that was killed many, many years ago." The prince retains this closed turtle in the temple of the ancestors and worships his carapace. Would the turtle be like to be dead and have its remains venerated, or would you rather be alive, shaking the tail in the mud of the swamps?
— I would prefer to be alive, wagging my tail in the mud of the swamps, replied the mandarins.
"You can leave," said Zhuang Zi. I also prefer to shake the tail in the mud of the swamps. ”
In China, more than in any other country in the world, we see how, century after century, the continuity of ideas, traditions, uses and customs manifests itself.
Mao Zedong, who knew well the cultural foundation of his homeland, sometimes cited old philosophers and stories from popular tradition, to the advantage of the ideology he defended. Here is how, in 1945, Mao talks about one of these stories:
“In ancient China there was a fable titled 'How Yukong removed the mountains'. This fable says that in times that go there, he lived in northern China an old man named Yukong. On the south side, in front of his house, were two large mountains, Taihang and Wangwu, which prevented his passage. Driving his children, Yukong decided to rock the mountains to pick -up blows. Seeing them in such a work, another old man named Chezzou, untied to laugh and said to them, ‘What a foolishness! Alone, you will never be able to rock these two mountains. ' Yukong replied:
‘When I die, my children will remain; When, in turn, they die, my grandchildren will remain, and so generations will continue uninterruptedly. As for these two mountains, no matter how high they are, they can no longer grow any further and, with each blow of the pickaxe, they become smaller. Why can't we raze them?'

“An old man poor had a horse and the animal fled. At night the neighbors came to manifest their grief, telling him that he had very little luck. The peasant simply answered: 'Maybe'.

At night, the neighbors came to mourn the low luck of the peasant that simply answered: 'Maybe'. The next day, the government officials responsible for the recruitment of young people to the Army arrived at the village, finding the Empire in war time. The peasant son did not go to the battlefields because he had a leg. At night the neighbors came to congratulate him once again for his good luck and the old man simply answered: 'Maybe.'
Now an old apologist, by Pe Yu king, who no one knows but which was written fourteen centuries ago:
“Once a monk, a bandit, a painter, a miser and a wise man traveled together. Night fell and they took shelter in a cave.
—You couldn't find a better place for a hermitage, exclaimed the monk.
"What a great refuge for robbers," said the bad guy said.
—The light from the torches, these plays of shadows, what extraordinary motifs for the brush!, murmured the painter in turn.
"But what a great place to hide a treasure!"
The wise man listened in silence and finally said:
— What a wonderful cave!”
In China, nothing is ever exactly what it seems. It may be, it may not be, it all depends on subtle or clumsy understandings of each person, their perspective, their gaze. In the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty, the literate Yuan Jing 袁晶 told the interesting story of a cat. Like this:
A court mandarin named Ji owned a magnificent cat. He was so proud of the feline that he decided to name him Tiger. One day, during an evening at his house with several friends, everyone started talking about the cat. One of them said:
"It is true that the tiger is a powerful animal, but the dragon has even more power." Why not call Dragon to the cat?
Another intervened:
–I admit that the Dragon is more powerful than the Tiger, but he has to rise into the air to reach the clouds. It therefore seems clear to me that the clouds are stronger than the dragon. Why not call the cat Cloud?
A third then said:
"The clouds can cover the whole earth, but they can't resist the wind that disperses them quickly." Why not call the cat wind?
A fourth guest added:
— What can the wind do in front of a stone wall? Why not call the cat Muro?
A fifth friend argued later:
— A wall is capable of resisting the wind, but rats know how to make holes in a wall. Why not call the cat Mouse?
An old man from Dongli's village heard the whole conversation in silence. Finally, he asked:
— What is the name of the animal that hunts mice?
Our João de Barros (1496-1570), an excellent sixteenth-century chronicler, in his Asia, Third Decade, which contains more than a hundred pages dedicated to China and the Chinese world, wrote around 1550:
“The Chinese say that they have two eyes of understanding about all things, we, those of Europe, after communicating with each other, have one eye, and all other nations are blind.”

In Dantu, one of the three districts of Zhenjiang (Jiangsu) where he lived for more than four decades, his memory is celebrated in a unique park in the country where you can see one thousand and three hundred copies of stone calligraphy engravings. Alluding to its source of inspiration, it was appropriately designed in front of the Hill of Ten Li, with aspects typical of landscape painting.
The admirable novelty of his art was praised by Emperor Huizong (r.1100-1125), who knew him and who in his vertical scroll Pavilion of the Awakening of the Clouds (ink on silk, 150 x 78.8 cm, at the Smithonian) transcribed the phrase from Confucius that highlights what will be noticed in paintings called shanshui, «rivers and mountains» in continuous mutation: «Before the sky send the rains of the season, mountains and rivers presented the clouds.»
In Mi Fu's paintings you can see this look at the changing fluid forms where the spirit could be revealed, unlike the drawings of animals or people that have stabilized forms (youdingxing).
His legacy was also and above all cultivated by painters over time. Pan Simu (1756-1839), already in the last dynasty seven hundred years later, was one of those who used horizontal dots applied with precision by brush on paper, depicting successive receding mountains that characterized the Mi Fu method.
Pan sim like Zhang Yin or Pan Gongshou, painters of the city of Zhenjiang, sought to establish a 'school' (father) based on the tradition of the city. In this memory inquiry, Pan sim realized his affinity with Mi Fu. It made it, for example, in two vertical rollers: the grou forest (helin) enevoid to rain (ink on paper, 128.9 x 31.4 cm, at the Minneapolis Art Institute); and in rain and fog in Helin (ink on paper, 109.9 x 31.8 cm, in the metmuseum).
In the latter he refers to a visit to the temple where Mi Fu's tomb was located on the Yellow Crane Mountain (Huanghe shan) writing a poem in which the expression "old fool", laodian, is a characteristic manifestation of the affectionate, somewhat harsh familiarity with which he they treated the adherents of the Dao; «The great fame of the crane forest extends for years and years,/ I spent the night there once in the spring and there I made this painting remembering the old fool./ If the old fool returned now, he would laugh saying;/ Who dared coming to steal my meditation on Chan?”</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves,

The year 2025 will be commanded by the wooden serpent yin (乙巳蛇 yǐ sì shé), that is, from the sixth terrestrial branch, from the wood element linked to the female principle, therefore to lunar, mysterious and intuitive force. It begins, in official terms of the Lunissolar calendar, on January 29, 2025 and ends on February 16, 2026, but for Geomancia or Fengshui (风水 Fēngshuǐ) The year only opens February 3 in the first spring, Lichun (立春 Lìchūn ). This year, from the point of view of the telluric blessings, it will be particularly awarded because it will have two spring, with a second Lichun on February 4, 2026.
And as for the descendants of the dragon “good things come to peers” (好事成双 hǎo shì chéng shuāng), promises good agriculture and fertility, being equally conducive to meditation and contact with nature, but also social contacts, because The wooden serpent, given its element, is the most communicative, creative, friendly and favorable to relationships between these reptiles. Moreover, this type of wood is defined by being a hardworking, honest and popular, it is not always recognized, so it brings as an ally the virtue of perseverance, which gives it the recognition of its efforts over time.
She is “the snake that leaves the hole” (KWOK, 1997, 67). It belongs to you the time period between 9am and 11am. Although its fixed element is fire, such as wood is of the tiger, and its constant color is, according to the element, red, in 2025 will predominate green, associated with wood.
The serpent is the strongest sex symbol and, therefore, in Indian Yoly philosophies of the Tantric line, which extend throughout Asia and, in particular by Southeast Asia, it is Kundalini, as it well caught the attention C.G. Jung in The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga. Notes to a seminar Given in 1932.
How do Chinese related to the serpent's life force? At first they were quite spontaneous, they had an animist philosophy that evolved into popular soism, but it must not be forgotten that from very early, from confucius and the establishment of confusion, and in a systematic way since Han, there has been In this culture a great determination to control the natural energies. This trend has redoubled the acceptance of Buddhist philosophy, initially far from the natural and tantric experiences.
During the times of the last Qing dynasty, religious experiences linked to Buddhism intensified and, as such, the conflict between natural and spiritual forces became manifest, opening a war similar to that seen in Christianity, with Eve and Adam fighting. being expelled from Paradise because of a supposedly infamous serpent.
The open war between natural forces and formal religion would still be recorded in Chinese literature, in one of the most poignant love stories, entitled The White Serpent (《白蛇传》Bái Shé Zhuàn), also known by the name of its protagonists Xu Xian (许仙Xǔ Xiān) and Bai Niangzi(白娘子Bái Niángzi), which reached its peak of popularity during the Qing dynasty.
In it, the lovers are hopelessly persecuted by a Buddhist bonzo, who destroys their happiness by insisting that Xu Xian (许仙) stay away from Bai Niangzi (白娘子), since she was an enchanted serpent.
Omitted by Bonzo would be the meditation effort that led the serpent to transfigure itself in human form.
What Bonzo Buddhist has not seen, as many Christian religious cannot see, is that on the outside of what seems to be transgression if it hides a natural and spontaneous force closely linked to the minds of those who deal with it. For a pure mind, the natural force has nothing impure, to a blurred mind, the force is, in the western version, sin, and in the eastern negative and demonic power.
The strength of the serpent is complete in itself. There is nothing to add to you. Attesting to its perfect completeness, there is a very told proverbial story, drawing feet to the serpent (畫/画蛇添足 huà shiān zú), often shortened in the expression the serpent feet (shé zú 蛇足).
古时候 ， 楚国有一家人 ， 祭完祖之后 ， 准备将祭祀用的一壶酒 ， 赏给帮忙办事的人喝。帮忙办事的人很多 ， ， 若是让一个 若是让一个人喝 ， 那能喝得有余。这一壶酒到底怎么分呢？大家都安静下来 ， 这时有人建议：每个人在地上画一条蛇 ， 谁画得快 ， 这壶酒就归他喝。大家都认为这个方法好 ， 都同意这样做。于是 ， 在地上画起蛇来。
有个人画得很快 ， 一转眼最先画好了 ， 他就端起酒壶要喝酒。但是他回头看看别人 ， 还都没有画好呢。心里想：他们画得真慢。他洋洋得意地说： “你们画得好慢啊！我再给蛇画几只脚也不算晚呢！” 于是 ， 他便左手提着酒壶 ， 右手给蛇画起脚来。正在他一边给蛇画脚 ， 一边说话的时候 ， ， ， 另外一个人已经画好了。那个人马上把酒壶从他手里夺过去 “你见过蛇吗？蛇是没有脚的 ， 你为什么要给它添上脚呢？所以第一个画好蛇的人不是你 ， 而是我了！ ”那个人说罢就仰起头来 ， 咕咚咕咚把酒喝下去了。
Here is my translation:
In ancient times, in the Chu Kingdom (楚國/国Chǔ Guó), there was a feudal lord who, after having made the necessary ritual libations to his ancestors, still had a jug of wine left over, which he planned to distribute to his servants. But as there were many, the wine was not enough for everyone, but for one it would be more than enough. After all, how should it be shared? To calm them down, one of them suggested: “each one will draw a snake on the ground, whoever finishes first will get the jug of wine.” Everyone agreed with the idea and so they started drawing. There was one who was eager to drink it, so he sent the drawing away in the blink of an eye.
When he looked at the others, he saw that they hadn't finished yet, so he thought they were very slow and said triumphantly: "You are so slow that I even have time to add feet to the snake!" Then, while holding the jar with his left hand, he added the reptile's feet with his right hand. At the time I was drawing his feet and talking, someone else finished his drawing; Taking the jar from his hand, he said: “Have you ever seen a snake? If they don't have feet, why did you add them?! Therefore, the first one to draw a snake is not you, but me.” When he finished speaking, he raised his head and Gluglu downed his wine.
In a stylistic equivalent to Portuguese, the first winner had blurred the painting. In an ontological reading, there is nothing to add to a complete force in itself. Therefore, this said is used to show someone to do something superfluous.
When the snake intends to be someone else, it has opened the path of metamorphosis, similar to that of the silkworm and the butterfly.
The Chinese are well aware of the power of the Serpent (shé 蛇), whose etymological reading is the radically other worm, the animal, the antithetical force of the civilized. This immense natural energy was renamed Little Dragon (小龙 Xiǎo Lóng) to give space to the reptile to cultivate and exercise on the spiritual path, on an interior journey from body to mind, without, however, losing its telluric roots. The serpent crawls on the earth, if it manages to rise to the heavens like a flying dragon, it brings about the union of the two primordial forces of the universe, that of Heaven and that of Earth, inside the human body and outside the cosmic body.

The building in the middle of the square, although it seems like a government site, is the city's exhibition room. In the west, two large shopping centers, one with cinema, extend the street where we are taken to the great canal's anchorage. In a small guard at the entrance of the boarding pier, the boat tickets are sold to Suzhou [we are in the late 90s] and every day a boat in the evening, on a trip made night in the night Jiangnan Channel [Jiangnan Yunhe (江南运河)]. Once, the route went to Wuxi, but this service was disconnected for two years.
The Jiangnan Canal begins in Zhenjiang, on the south bank of the Changjiang (Yangzi or Yangtze), after the Grand Canal crosses the third largest river in the world, and to the south it follows its course through Danyang (丹阳), Changzhou (常州), Wuxi (无锡), Suzhou (苏州), Pingwang (平望), reaching Hangzhou where it connects to the Qiantang River.
At the window, which seemed to keep the alley to take to the boarding door, we bought for the next day by 98 yuan the small [which of a city bus] ticket in a bed, in a blingte 115 Yuan are exhausted. They ask to arrive at five in the afternoon, half an hour before the match.
He looked at the pier from where two years before he had left by boat to Suzhou and returned now prepared to repeat the trip, but when he arrived at the pier I find it being demolished. The boats of these trips are still anchored, but these have now been suspended indefinitely. By chance, we realize the movement registered at the bottom of the pier, with people waiting next to a triangle sign indicating the boat stop. Asking, we found no trip to the former Nanxingqiao (南星桥) boarding pier, situated shortly before reaching the Sanlang Temple, near the Southern Bus Terminal.
Now a boat career was open, which on a short ten -minute trip to downstream, touched by brief moments at Baziqiao Zhan (坝子桥站), next to the Bazi Bridge (坝子桥), then returning to the pier where we had party. By five yuan we can look at one of the city's channels, which although closed lets down water to the large channel and looking like an attractive place, a bridge with three arches covered by a wooden roof is the door of a branch of channel.
Also for five yuan, we are taken to the ancient Gongchen Bridge, next to the square where the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal Museum is located. And so we returned to visit this excellent museum, which created a new tourist hub for the city of Hangzhou.
Models of boats are on display there, and you can see the routes of maritime travel over the centuries and the centuries of construction of the Grand Canal, its sponsors and the way in which the obstacles presented were resolved to make this route a direct connection between the capital of the North and the rest of China.
ON THE GREAT CANAL
Only with the new opening of the country to tourism held in 1978 came the interest to take a new benefit from this great engineering work. By the great channel the goods were still transported, although parts of the route were interrupted, as navigation had been abandoned since the late nineteenth century. In response, in 1981 Wuxi's tourist entities opened a trip between Suzhou and Yangzhou and another, from Tai Lake to Hangzhou.
The boat made available to tourism was a faithful replica of Emperor Sui's dragon boat, Yangdi. In the late 1990s, the trips are between Hangzhou and Suzhou and then to Wuxi the boats are normal two-story passenger boats. Then, in the second or third year after the beginning of the III Millennium, the trip ceased to be made for Wuxi and was only made between Hangzhou and Suzhou and in the year 2007 it was interrupted. We believe, to restructure and prepare new boats for tourists to enjoy the beauties of the landscapes and the history of the great channel.
At five in the afternoon we arrived at the pier, half an hour before departure. Fifteen minutes past the hour, at a quarter to six we are sailing through the waters of the Grand Canal. The delay was due to having to arrange the bikes for the cycle tourism group on the boat, arriving just before departure time.
The boat we are traveling on has two floors and approximately twenty cabins, with common bathrooms, a kitchen and a small lounge, where meals, dinner and breakfast are taken.
The trip will be made at night by the region known as Jiangnan [southern Rio], which crosses the lands south of Changjiang (Yangzi River), in the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, where it comes from the channel built in the qin dynasty with 85 km long and extended in 605. From Hangzhou passes the lands of Huzhou and Jiaxing and leaving Zhejiang's province enters Jiangsu's and surrounding the Tai lake to Suzhou, where by boat will end our trip.
From Hangzhou we left for Suzhou, in the comparison of the Venetian traveler Marco Polo, twin cities in terms of beauty, Paradises on Earth.
Night falls in Hangzhou when we cross the Gongzhen Bridge, built in 1631 entirely of stone with three arches and which keeps us awake on deck, despite it drizzling, as it begins the journey that has not yet been navigated. A passenger boat passes by carrying just one person, which is not surprising as the fog and drizzle throughout the afternoon takes away the pleasure of the trip.
The poplar trees lining the cobbled banks are suddenly lit by the red lanterns of an old-style waterfront restaurant waiting for customers. The beauty of the landscape is perhaps only due to the shadows at night.
Boat traffic is intense and all are cargo boats, some large, which can fit containers, others transporting sand, coal or wooden logs. The boat, with its flat hull and U-shaped bow, sails shallowly along the water's edge. At the stern of the vessel, at the top of the cabin, there are the signal lights, with the green one on the right side and the red one on the left. It uses an intense white spotlight to illuminate the channel from the front and when crossing paths with other vessels it deflects it, or turns it off. Darkness wins. Before crossing other boats, some in the opposite direction, others to be overtaken, the spotlight comes on again for a few seconds to warn and visualize the size of the boats.
Next to a canal diversion, a diesel pump on the bank waits to refill fuel for anyone passing by. The waters carry Styrofoam debris and tree branches. From time to time, a factory on the banks has its pier taking advantage of this privileged transport route to receive raw materials and send production.
The width size of the channel varies and sometimes allows the passage at the same time of four boats, but in other places for three is tight.
We came across a convoy of boats pulled by a tug, where the workers' cabins were located, carrying ten long container boats. A light touch on our boat makes itself felt.
If during the first two hours of the trip the horn is constant, then it only lets out a shrill whistle sound when passing a group of houses and when it crosses the company boat in the opposite direction.
We fall asleep, not without first feeling another touch between vessels and this time the blow is stronger.
We arrived at our destination early in the morning, after more than nine hours of sailing on the Grand Canal. At 5:30, the boat docked next to the Precious Belt Bridge (Baodai Qiao, 宝带桥) in the southeastern part of Suzhou, in Wuzhong district, but we only left at half past six. Two buses wait on Changqiao Street (长桥街道) to take passengers to the city center, six kilometers away.
Baodai qiao is considered one of China's most representative bridges and is named because it was built between 816 and 819 at the expense of selling the valuable belt of Wang Zhongshu, governor of Suzhou in the Tang dynasty. With an extension of 317 meters and 4.1 meters wide, it has 53 arches, with three openings is sufficient to allow the boats to continue through the large channel and also cross the River Daidai and Lake Tantai. The rest of the bridge makes pier, being at the level of the vessels that used and easily discharged the goods.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Death | Rocha Vieira dies at age 85</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/obito-morreu-rocha-vieira-aos-85-anos/</link><description>Vasco Rocha Vieira, the last Portuguese Governor of Macau, died yesterday at the age of 85. The general had been ill for a long time. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa remembered him as “one of the most illustrious officers” of the Army, but, for Macau, Rocha Vieira goes down in history as the great worker behind the measures decided in the 1987 Joint Declaration
 
It has long been sick, even failing some recent events in Lisbon about Macau and the transition. Vasco Rocha Vieira, General, former Chief of Staff of the Army, and last Portuguese governor of Macao, died in the early hours of 85 years old.
Born on August 16, 1939, he held the position of Governor of Macao between 1991 and 1999, when the transfer of the territory to China was processed. However, Rocha Vieira already had a connection to Macau, as he was in the territory after April 25. In addition, he was also Minister of the Republic of the Azores between 1986 and 1991.
One of the first personalities to react to his death, in Portugal, was the President of the Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who expressed, in an official note, his “deep regret” for the death of Vasco Rocha Vieira, remembering him as “one of the most distinguished officers” of the Army and praising their “marked patriotism”.
In a note published on the official website of the Presidency of the Republic on the Internet, the head of state recalls Rocha Vieira as "one of the most illustrious officers of the Portuguese army in the transition to democracy and in the first decades of his statement." “Always closely linked to commands, it has also performed political functions such as Minister of the Republic for the Autonomous Region of the Azores,” is remembered in the note.
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa also points out that Rocha Vieira was “very close to President António Ramalho Eanes”, having been “designated chancellor of the old military orders”.
“The symbolism of the moment of transferring the Portuguese administration to the Chinese will remain in the memory of many Portuguese as an example of meaning, meaning of the public cause and marked patriotism,” reads the note of regret.
The President of the Republic, who claims to have followed “closely the last months” of Rocha Vieira's life, “presents to his family, and, much in particular, to his widow and children, the testimony of gratitude of Portugal, with very longing friendship".
In his biography, entitled “To all the ports I arrived at”, he describes the moment when Mário Soares, then President of the Republic, said to Rocha Vieira: “I need you. Go to Macau and see if you can put that in order”, in reference to the Macau fax case, related to the construction of Macau International Airport, which gave so many headaches to his predecessor, Carlos Melancia, also now deceased.
The general will then replied that nothing demanded to go to Macau. “I didn't ask you anything, nor did I put it in conditions. I went to Macau with the same spirit with which I went to the Azores. It was not a political position inherent in a career. It was, in fact, a mission, ”he describes.
It was then up to Rocha Vieira and his team to achieve all the objectives and ideals for the future of Macau present in the Joint Declaration that had been signed between Portugal and China in 1987. The Government led by Rocha Vieira saw the birth of the airport, built the entire bilingual legislative framework that is still in force today and built the Macau Cultural Center, inaugurated by Jorge Sampaio on March 19, 1999, among many other initiatives, including in the area of urbanism.
A “great friend”
Rocha Vieira came, by the way, to make the place available to the Macau Executive when Jorge Sampaio was elected President of the Republic, at the turn from 1995 to 1996. “When I went to Macau I didn't know how things were going to run and how long I was going There stayed there, ”he recalled in his biography. However, and despite Sampaio's initial hesitation in change, the truth is that Rocha Vieira turned out to be, because “her replacement would affect the regular sequence of the process” at a time when “the passage was already in sight was already in sight From territory administration to China, ”it is described in“ all the ports I arrived ”.
Speaking to RTP, Chito Rodrigues, a general who was acting governor of Macau, left words of condolence over the death of a friend.
“I remember him as a great friend and honorary member of the League of Combatants. He has always had a relationship with us and is a reference for us. We knew it was bad and we were, in a way, not surprised [with the news of death], but it is always an unpleasant surprise.”
Chito Rodrigues recalls him in the exercise of his duties in Macau as someone who contributed "so that Macao was a quiet place for decolonization to be done in a" exemplary "way." “I was with him at the opening of the airport and had close relations with him as governor. It was someone who replaced his predecessors successfully and humble, replacing the tradition of military governors in Macao, ”he added.
In the book “Macau between two worlds”, by Fernando Lima and Eduardo Cintra Torres, the former Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, remembered Rocha Vieira as “a courageous and judicious man, with enormous integrity and an excellent servant of his country”. “I think Portugal was very lucky to have such a good man as its last Governor, in such a difficult place”, he pointed out.
The controversy
Rocha Vieira's name was, however, involved in some controversies, namely with the creation of the Fundação Jorge Álvares and Fundação Oriente, especially regarding the funds allocated to these two entities. “The bulk of public opinion in the territory and the Beijing authorities contested the legitimacy of a contract under which an entity based in Lisbon was fed with resources generated in Macau”, reads Rocha Vieira’s biography. He only intended for the foundation to “play a useful role for Macau”, and the controversy was diluted over time.
On social networks, the journalist and former director of Macau today, João Severino said “mourn a lot” the disappearance of Rocha Vieira. “General Vasco Rocha Vieira left us after several weeks hospitalized at the hospital. Macao's last governor was a good man for many people and discriminatory for many. In any case his military career was exemplary and left marks in the administration of Macao. I kept with the illustrious governor some controversial moments, always within the greatest cordiality and consideration by the maximum representative of my country in Macau. I present to your wife Dr. Leonor and his children my condolences and rest in peace, ”he wrote.
An entity that reacted to the disappearance of Rocha Vieira was the Luso-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCILC), which on social networks issued a note of regret about the death of the 138th Portuguese Governor of Macao and presided at the CCILC Strategic Council.
“General Rocha Vieira played a striking and exemplary role throughout his life, standing out for his commitment to service to the nation, dedication to relations between Portugal and China, and the historical role in closing the administration cycle Portuguese in Macau. ”
The same note also states that "in the leadership of the CCILC Strategic Council, his strategic vision, wisdom and human values ​​have always been a source of inspiration for the entire direction and executive team."
The Lisbon City Council also officially reacted to his disappearance. “Rocha Vieira dedicated his life to defending the national interest, notably serving Portugal as Chief of Staff of the Army and as the last Governor of Macau. A visionary statesman, he ensured a peaceful transfer of Macau's sovereignty to China. A man of courage, he contributed to the consolidation of the democratic process, being a fundamental part of the 25th of November 1975. It was an honor to have his testimony at the first ceremony to commemorate the 25th of November in the Town Hall, in 2023.”
Goodbye to Macau
The images of Rocha Vieira holding the Portuguese flag to his chest on December 19, 1999, with his face visibly moved, are famous, as if saying goodbye to the “mission” he agreed to carry out in Macau.
After his role as governor, Rocha Vieira was maintaining narrow ties with the territory, and the last time he was in Macau was in 2023, to receive the distinction of Honoris Causal Doctorate from the University of Science and Technology of Macao.
There, he highlighted that the “good historical relations” with China are “an asset for Portugal” and that today the country is “an emerging superpower”. The general said that “another great asset” for Portugal is China's interest in the Portuguese language, highlighting the growing number of Chinese universities that teach Portuguese. At the end of 2020, the Coordinator of the Pedagogical and Scientific Center for the Portuguese Language at the Macau Polytechnic University, Gaspar Zhang Yunfeng, said that there were around 50 higher education institutions offering Portuguese courses in mainland China.
“China is interested in Portuguese developing (…) also to be able to have, through Portugal, a closer relationship with Portuguese-speaking countries”, highlighted Rocha Vieira.
In a last interview given to the Lusa agency, in 2019, Rocha Vieira recalled the times in Macau and its vicissitudes, especially regarding the transition process.
“I had more problems with the Portuguese side than with the Chinese side (…) many times, due to a lack of perception. Normally, people are far away, in Lisbon – this is a historical thing, which is not just for now – and they think they know the solutions better than those in Macau”, he stated.
Rocha Vieira assured that, when it was necessary to define “the direction, the fundamental objectives of the policies for Macau, they were discussed by the Government of Macau, in Lisbon, with whom they should be discussed, with the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister”, there was “always” about this “a great understanding on the part of the Portuguese sovereign bodies and a great proof of trust in relation to those who were in the territory”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:26:24</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Trump says tariffs are “the only way” the country can be “treated properly”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/eua-trump-diz-que-tarifas-sao-a-unica-forma-do-pais-ser-tratado-como-deve/</link><description>European countries will be subject to customs tariffs, "the only form" of the United States "being treated as they should be," US President Donald Trump said Tuesday.
“The European Union (EU) is very bad for us. They treat us very badly. They do not accept our cars or our agricultural products. In fact, they don't accept much, ”said the president of the United States, adding that they will be tariffs.
Questioned by the press at the White House, Trump also assured that his administration is discussing “10 percent tariffs on Chinese products, because they send [the opioid] fentanyl to Mexico and Canada”, which ends up being consumed in the United States. United.
“It’s probably February 1st,” added Donald Trump, the day that corresponds to the date announced the day before for the application of 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian products.
China reacted yesterday, saying it was “firmly determined” to “defend its national interests”.
"We have always believed that there are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war," said Mao Ning, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry at a press conference.
The president of the European Commission (EC), Ursula Von der Leyen, who participated in the Davos Economic Forum, Switzerland, on Tuesday, ensured that Europe is ready to talk to the United States government, remembering that Washington is a important commercial partner.
Our first priority is to quickly start conversations about our common interests and be ready to negotiate, ”he said:“ We will be pragmatic, but we will keep firm in our principles: to defend our interests and respect our values, ”he said the European leader.
"Europe will continue to defend cooperation, not only with our longtime friends (…) but also with all the countries with which we have common interests," added von der Leyen.
“Our message to the rest of the world is simple: we are ready to dialogue with you, if this can lead to mutual benefits”, he added, ensuring that he intends to “deepen” relations between Brussels and Beijing.

During his presidential campaign, Trump had already denounced the United States' trade deficit in relation to the EU, comparing the bloc to “a little China” and accusing it of taking advantage of the world's leading economic power.
“We have a trade deficit with the EU of 350 billion dollars”, he insisted on Tuesday, noting that “China is aggressive, but it is not just China, other countries are also big aggressors”.
The US commercial deficit with the EU will rise to $ 131 billion in 2023, according to data from the White House Commercial Representative (USTR), and is mainly concentrated in four countries: Germany, France, Ireland and Italy.
Before being reelected, Donald Trump had already threatened the EU with the imposition of customs rights on European products unless the block increased their US oil and gas purchases.
The European Commissioner for the Economy, Valdis Dombrovskis, guaranteed on Monday, after Trump's inauguration, that the EU is “ready to defend its economic interests,” as it has already done “during the first Trump administration when it introduced tariffs on steel and aluminum ”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:45:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Death / Rocha Vieira: Macau remembers last Portuguese Governor</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/obito-rocha-vieira-macau-recorda-ultimo-governador-portugues/</link><description>Macao's last governor, Vasco Rocha Vieira, who died at age 85, launched the foundations of the success of the Chinese region and defended the rights of civil servants, although with "some mismatches," local leaders told Lusa. Vasco Rocha Vieira, former army's head of the army between 1976 and 1978, died in the early hours of Monday at the age of 85, confirmed to the Portuguese official source of that military industry.
“He is an illustrious figure, fundamental in the history of Macau’s transition, but also, to a certain extent, in the present and the future,” said José Sales Marques, president of Leal Senado, the former city council, between 1993 and 1999. “There is a lot something that was done during that period and that continues today. The bases of the Macau Special Administrative Region also have a lot to do with the work of Lieutenant General Rocha Vieira”, argued Sales Marques.
Rocha Vieira held the position of governor of Macau between 1991 and 1999, when the transfer of the territory to China was processed. It was in his mandate that the construction of the city's airport was completed.
The Macau that Rocha Vieira found and left “doesn’t compare. What was done in all those years is something that history has already recorded”, defended Sales Marques. also a member of the then Rocha Vieira Advisory Council.
Former deputy António Ng Kuok Cheong told Lusa that, despite the distrust of the Chinese, the administration “tried to do something to encourage the economic growth of the city, which was very poor at that time, before returning Macau”.
António NG, elected to the Legislative Assembly five months after the appointment of Rocha Vieira, stressed that the main obstacle was China's resistance to the liberalization of the game sector, which would only be released in 2002.
Something that forced the Portuguese administration to sell land to finance infrastructure projects, inadvertently planting the roots of the housing problem that Macau currently faces, he said.
“They tried to sell the land openly, but the Chinese government prevented them. Thus, most land was sold to powerful people in China for a very low price, because Macau's economy was very weak, ”said NG. A class of landlords was created who, after Macao became the world capital of casinos, enriched by controlling the offer and maintaining high housing prices, lamented the former deputy.
Work in civil servants
Jorge Fão, one of the founders of the Macau Public Service Workers Association (ATFMP), in 1987, noted that Rocha Vieira “fulfilled his mission as governor” and “dignified his country”.
The former president of ATFPM, ahead of the association "for over ten years", told Lusa that he was "unionist before being a politician" and "had some mismatches" with the lieutenant general.
Fão explained that it was “one of the protagonists” who worked so that, after the transition from Macau to China, “civil servants [of the Portuguese Administration] were entitled to a pension” paid for Portugal.
“No employees of the other colonies were entitled (…) when we started talking about discussing the delivery of Macau to China, we were very worried. We ended our trade union struggles and had several meetings with the governance of Portugal and Macau (…). We had some meetings and also in these meetings we had mismatches, ”he recalled.
In the end, summarized the current president of the General Assembly of the Association of Retirees, Retirees and Pensioners of Macau, “the outcome was not bad”. “Everyone must be satisfied, I too took part in this fight and have been living on this pension for over 30 years”, he argued.
In the passage of administration, there were about 3,600 retirees with pensions transferred to Portugal, he concluded. In 2022, Jorge Fão told Lusa to believe that they lived in the Chinese region about two thousand renovated from the former Portuguese administration of Macao.
PS praises life “entirely dedicated to the service of Portugal”
The PS expressed regret at the death of the last Portuguese governor of Macau, praising a life “entirely dedicated to the service of Portugal” of a “prestigious soldier” and one of the “best interpreters of the importance of Macau”.

Words by Eanes

Regarding the political level, Eanes concludes that Rocha Vieira had an activity of “great quality and great importance for the country, both as Minister of the Republic for the Azores, either, as governor of Macao, putting all his commitment to design and execution Successfully, a policy of successful Macao transformation, also participating with the successful success, in the transfer of the administration of the territory of Macao to the Popular Republic of China. ”

In Hong Kong, only six percent of respondents are committed to their jobs
 
Understanding how workers around the world feel in the workplace, and in relation to the job they have, is the objective of the International Gallup Association report, entitled “State of the Global Workplace 2024”. If on a global and regional level East Asia does well in some indicators, the scenario is not at all favorable with regard to the commitment or commitment that workers have for the company they are linked to or for the functions they perform.
Inside East Asia includes countries and regions such as China, Hong Kong, Japan, Mongolia, South Korea and Taiwan. This area of ​​the globe has “the lowest percentage, at regional level, of employees who feel daily sadness”, but has “the third highest, regional percentage of employees who say they are looking, and actively, of a new job. ” In addition, East Asia has “the third lower percentage at regional level of committed employees” with the work they have (18 percent, which still represents a rise of 1 percent compared to the corresponding period between 2022 and 2023) .
Quite the contrary, 67 percent of respondents are not at all committed or committed to work, an increase of five percent compared to the same period. Furthermore, 14 percent say they are completely uncommitted to the company they work for, minus six percent.
As for negative emotions lived daily, and more often, the stress factor leads, with 46 percent response, six percent from the period between 2022 and 2023. percent answers, which did not generate any answers in the last investigation. “Sadness” was a feeling revealed by 12 percent of respondents, 1 more percent compared to the previous inquiry, and “loneliness”, which also has direct entry into this list of less good feelings lived at work, 18 percent.
If dissatisfaction with work is demonstrated in the previous numbers, certainties increase in tone in the “work environment – ​​good time to find a job” category, with 51 percent answering affirmatively, 11 percent more responses compared to the previous survey . Furthermore, the category “Intention to leave – Looking or actively looking for a new job” was chosen by 54 percent of respondents, two percent less compared to the years 2022 to 2023.
In the “Life Assessment” category, those who claim to have a prosperous life are 32 percent, seven percent, in contrast to the 62 percent of respondents who claim to be suffering some kind of difficulties, another seven percent in relation to to the last inquiry. The “suffering” category related to the job was chosen for six percent of participants in the inquiry, a direct entry in this study.
Sadness below
For the Gallup study, 40,428 people were interviewed in 41 countries, with the country sample containing around 1,000 men and women. The poll's margin of error “is between +3-5 percent with a 95 percent confidence level”, it is said.
The study also compares the data recorded by eastern Asia workers with the other countries. And once again is the lack of commitment and the feeling of “dressing the nightgown” that persists in many companies. In worldwide terms, 62 percent of the answers point to the absence of commitment, when in East Asia this percentage over 67 percent.
Regarding “Life Assessment”, if worldwide 58 percent of respondents say they are experiencing difficulties, the percentage in East Asia is 62 percent. However, the suffering felt is only in six percent of the responses, while worldwide the bar is eight percent. In relation to this factor, the low percentage of the feeling of “daily sadness” stands out, with 12 percent of responses, when worldwide the bar rises to 22 percent.
The feeling of stress is also higher, with 46 percent answers, when at global level is 41 percent.
China: anger and difficulties
Looking at the criteria in each country, 19 percent of China workers said they were committed to work, two more percent annually, while in Hong Kong only six percent of people are committed and who like what they do, the which is a break of one percent.
In the “Life Assessment”, 36 percent of workers in China say they are facing difficulties, up 1 percent, while in Taiwan 41 percent say they are facing less good times, representing a direct entry into the classification, with no previous score to compare. In the case of Hong Kong, 17 percent of respondents say they are experiencing difficulties, 1 percent more than in the previous survey.
As for the feeling of “daily stress”, China rises first in the ranking with 53 percent answers, still 2 percent in annual terms, with Hong Kong following her footsteps, with 49 percent answers . Japan is third with 41 percent people to feel stress daily.
In response to the question whether you felt angry the previous day, China leads again with 18 percent of responses, despite the annual drop of 2 percent; followed by South Korea, with 17 percent affirmative responses, and then Hong Kong with 16 percent. In China, only 12 percent of workers said they felt sad, placing the country in third place. In relation to Hong Kong, there were 11 percent affirmative responses in this area.
Jon Clufton, CEO of Gallup, leaves an alert about increasing mental health problems worldwide, especially related to the work environment and the form of relationship in the business environment. About 20 percent of workers from around the world “experience daily loneliness”, and this feeling “is greater among total teleworking workers”.
“In this year’s report, 41 percent of workers say they feel ‘a lot of stress’. However, stress varies significantly depending on the way organizations are managed. Those who work in companies with bad management practices (actively unmotivated) are almost 60 percent more likely to be stressed than people who work in environments with good management practices (committed). In fact, the experience of ‘a lot of stress’ is reported about 30 percent more often by employees working under poor management than by the unemployed,” said the Gallup CEO.
For him, “leaders know that stress in the workplace is a problem – they have seen the data, listened to colleagues and felt it themselves”. “A quarter of leaders feel burned out often or always, and two-thirds feel it at least sometimes. Many are trying to solve the problem, but often ineffectively”, he concludes.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:41:16</pubDate></item><item><title>Toponymy | Study links streets with Portuguese names to colonialism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/toponimia-estudo-relaciona-ruas-com-nomes-lusos-com-colonialismo/</link><description>In his master's thesis “Sino-Portuguese Culture in Macau – History in the Streets”, Zhao Zhen argues that the Portuguese Administration diluted “the national identity” of the Chinese population, by placing names referring to Portugal on the streets, namely writers, navigators, governors and public officials
 
Zhao Zhen, author of the master's dissertation “Sino-Portuguese Culture in Macao-Street History and Sino-Portuguese Culture from the perspective of the names of the streets of Macau)”, argues that the choice of street names with reference to Portugal during Portugal The years of the Portuguese administration was an effective form of colonization and the creation of the feeling of belonging to the colonizing nation, especially with regard to the Chinese community.
In the dissertation, defended at the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro (UTAD), it is concluded that “before the return of Macau to China the Portuguese government carried out a political and cultural practice through the attribution of street names to Portuguese way ”.
Thus, the names of the streets of Macao served “as a means of transmitting a collective memory, starting with the construction of the Portuguese government's image in Macau and the guidance of its main values”, using “iconic historical figures and events to reinforce the identification of the colonized with their colonizing identity ”.
Zhao Zhen further added that “during the 400 years of colonization of Macau by the Portuguese State, linguistic symbols were applied to the inhabitants of Macau through the naming of streets, diluting the traditional national identity of the Chinese and implanting that of the colonizers, thus achieving the objective of remodeling the national identity of local inhabitants”.
For the author of the study, the issue of very particular toponymy of the territory brought consequences with regard to national identity. “The names of the streets of Macao are different from those of other Chinese cities, and this has impacted the cultural identity of the local population, which grew up with Chinese and Portuguese history and culture and has no strong sense of cultural identity. Thus dilutes its mission to convey its national culture. ”
A form of dominance
It is true that Zhao Zhen's academic work, in the area of ​​Cultural Sciences, draws attention to the fact that Macau's toponymy is a reflection of a mixture of cultures. However, the author goes further, analyzing how many streets there are in Portuguese and Chinese named after important personalities, highlighting the fact that Portuguese culture is dominant.
The fact that there are streets in Macau named after Portuguese soldiers, former governors or politicians, such as Mário Soares, Sidónio Pais or Ramalho Eanes, is seen as synonymous with the fact that the Portuguese invested in “an effective process” of transmitting “a materialized vision of the world that influences and transmits social relations between people and different social classes”. Thus, what occurred was “an act that does not use violence as a form of forced control of the minds and conscience of the population”, in which “a means of coercion” was not applied.
Zhao Zhen states that "there are 26 streets with the name of Portuguese government officials in Macao who were distinguished by the contribution they made to the city, with no street with the name of a Chinese employee in Macao."
This shows “the distinction made by the Portuguese colonizers as a ruling class and the Chinese as a dominated class” is indicated. However, the author points out that “the Portuguese colonization of Macao was not an absolute aggression or dominion”, because “the colonizers tried to achieve leadership from a variety of perspectives, including ideological”, in which “the process of achieving this leadership It was interspersed with a more complex racial and cultural existence. ”
According to the author, “the first systematic delimitation of streets and the establishment of names by the Portuguese Government of Macau was in 1869”, and many names were used with links to the Discoveries and the former Portuguese Empire.
Zhao Zhen gives the example of Rua de João de Almeida, which “is named after a general who stood out in campaigns to assert colonial power in Angola, Africa, at the beginning of the 20th century”.
In total, there are 26 streets with references to the discoveries and former Portuguese navigators, showing that “the colonial administration [Portuguese] used external political forces to indoctrinate the inhabitants of Macao with the intention of achieving leadership, guiding society through manipulation spiritual, moral and cultural ”. In addition, the author considers that it was used "a colonial vocabulary to create a sense of identity and subordination among the inhabitants, in order to achieve permanent colonization."
Highlight is the existence of nine streets in Macau named after Macanese, such as Rua Francisco H. Fernandes, who was born in the territory on February 13, 1863, son of Portuguese parents, and who was a close friend of Sun Yat -sen, father of the Republican Revolution in China, in 1911.
The place of the Chinese
In the same dissertation it is read that, in contrast to the primacy of references to Portuguese culture and history, there are only 12 streets in Macao “with the name of Chinese”, most of which were “were merchants of the peninsula and all had connections with the Portuguese government of the region ”. In turn, "Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Avenue is the only street with the name of a Chinese political figure."
Citing another academic, nicknamed Kuan, Zhao Zhen states that "in the case of names with names of Chinese celebrities, besides being inferior in number, they were non -political figures." "The Portuguese government of Macao, when it baptized public roads, was intentionally into account political factors, wanting to convey the message that Macau was under Portuguese rule and that, politically speaking, was a Portuguese colony," said this same academic.
Highlight are two streets named after Macau's return to China, namely Avenida Doutor Henry Fok and Avenida Doutor Ma Man Kei. “These personalities were distinguished by their notable contributions to the reunification of Hong Kong and Macau and to the development of China, so the attribution of the name of the street to these personalities reflects the influence of political factors after the end of Macau's long colonial history and smooth reunification with China. The addition of the word ‘doctor’ to their names shows even more respect for them”, it reads.
Also noteworthy is the existence of 140 streets in Macau whose names are translated phonetically from Chinese, highlighting Avenida de Ip Heng, Avenida de Lok Koi, Pátio de Iong Loc, Pátio Fu Van or Rua de San Lei. “All these words Chinese women express the people's desire for a better life and the search for quality of life. Other names are related to Chinese religion, such as Largo de Pao Cong Mio, Rua de Kun Iam Tong”, it is mentioned, without forgetting the 69 streets with names paraphrased in Chinese with links to Chinese beliefs.
“In order to live a better life and to forward it in the expected direction, the naming of the streets reflects geographical elements, as well as people's hopes for their future lives. The names of the streets are mentioned and used so often that people tend to give them good meanings to satisfy their own intentions of a better life. Influenced by traditional Chinese cultural concepts, many of the streets names in Macau have auspicious and lucky meanings, with the words 'harmony, tranquility, friendship, benevolence, concordia'.
There are also streets whose names "show traders' desire to have a prosperous business and to get all the profits that come from business."
In general terms, Zhao Zhen concludes that “Macau's experience proves the possibility of harmonious coexistence of various communities and cultures”, and the toponymy “reflects the coexistence and mix of the East and West, the harmony and difference between them, which Today is a mirror of the culture and fundamental values ​​of society. ”</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:56:42</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Trump takes office and throws barbs to China on Panama Canal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/eua-trump-toma-posse-e-lanca-farpas-a-china-sobre-canal-do-panama/</link><description>The new North American President, Donald Trump, promised this Monday to take control of the Panama Canal, rename the Gulf of Mexico and reinforce taxation on foreign countries, confirming intentions already expressed for his second term in the White House.
In his speech at the inauguration ceremony as 47th President of the United States Donald Trump stressed that the purpose of the agreement and the spirit of the treaty in relation to the Panama channel "were fully violated", promising to take control of this vital maritime infrastructure to global trade.
“And most importantly, China operates the Panama Canal, and we didn't give it to China, we gave Panama. And let's take it back, ”he justified in his speech held at the Capitol (headquarters of the US Congress) in Washington.
In another previously expressed intention, Trump also confirmed that he will soon change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America”.
More taxes
Upon his return to the White House (North American presidency), after a first term between 2017 and 2021, the Republican politician also stated that he intends to reinforce taxation in foreign countries in favor of North American citizens.
“I will immediately begin to reform our commercial system to protect families and US workers. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will impose rates and taxes on foreign countries to enrich our citizens, ”he said.
Expel illegal
Donald Trump also guaranteed that he will expel “millions and millions” of illegal immigrants, one of the main focuses of his election campaign. “First, I will declare a state of emergency on our southern border” with Mexico, said the President, adding that he will send the Army to patrol that region.
“All illegal entries will be immediately blocked and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens to where they came,” added the Republican President.
The oath of the new North American leader was taken shortly after the inauguration of his future vice president, JD Vance, with whom he led the nomination of the Republican Party, which, on November 5, 2024, won the presidential elections against the candidate Democrat led by Kamala Harris.
The ceremony in Washington took place at 5 pm, Lisbon time (dawn in Macao) and was marked by the presence of populist and far-right international politicians, but with scarce government officials and without leaders of the European Union (EU), except for the first -Menial Italian minister, Giorgia Meloni.</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 02:59:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Oxfam | Report says that rich fortunes have increased by 2024</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/oxfam-relatorio-diz-que-fortunas-dos-mais-ricos-aumentaram-em-2024/</link><description>A report released yesterday by Oxfam indicates that the richest fortunes in the world increased two billions of dollars last year, equivalent to $ 5.7 billion a day. The non -governmental organization suggests measures that favor equality and alert to the risks of the concentration of wealth and power
 
It's called “Takers not Makers-The Unjust Poverty and Unearned Wealth of Coloniaism” [those who receive and do not create-the unfair poverty and the unmeasured richness of colonialism] and is the latest Oxfam report, non-governmental organization (NGO ) which brings together 19 countries. The document draws attention to poverty in the world and inequalities in the distribution of wealth.
The report released yesterday concludes that inequality shows no signs of slowing down. This is because, last year, the combined wealth of billionaires, globally, increased by two billion dollars, equivalent to 5.7 billion dollars per day, according to Oxfam.
This means that it grew at a pace three times higher than the previous year, according to the NGO.
This was the main conclusion of the report released yesterday on the occasion of the start of the Davos World Economic Forum, which every year brings together the world's main political and economic leaders in the Alpine city.
In the last year alone, the report reports, an average of almost four new multimillionaires a week emerged, as Oxfam contrasts with World Bank poverty data, which estimates that the number of people living with less than 6.85 Dollars a day has almost not changed since 1990.
In 2024, there were 2,769 multimillionaires worldwide, instead of 2,565 the previous year, and its combined wealth increased from 13 to 15 billions of dollars in just 12 months. It is the second largest increase in the combined wealth of multimillionaires in a single year since there is a record.
100 million more
The joint wealth of the ten richest men in the world increased, on average, almost $ 100 million a day, the study indicates. Even if they lost 99 percent of their richness overnight, "they would remain multimillionaires."
The NGO predicts that, in less than a decade, the first "billionaire" of the planet arises and does not exclude the possibility that there are at least five. Worldwide, the report reveals that 36 percent of the wealth of the richest is inherited and 61 percent is also marked by clientelism and/or linked to monopolistic power.
Oxfam is based on data from Forbes magazine's wealth ranking, which shows that all billionaires under the age of 30 inherited their wealth and, according to data from the Swiss bank UBS, over the next 20 to 30 years, a thousand of those Current multimillionaires will leave their heirs more than 5.2 billion dollars.
Southern Money
For Oxfam, the system “causes large flows of money to move from the global South to the North, benefiting the richest population”, in a kind of “modern colonialism”.
In 2023 alone, through the financial system, 30 million dollars per hour will have been withdrawn from countries in the global South to the richest 1 percent of countries in the global North, such as the United Kingdom, the United States and France.
In this way, the “super-rich” from the countries of the global North control 69 percent of the world's wealth, concentrate 77 percent of the combined wealth of all billionaires and represent around 68 percent of the total, although they constitute only 21 percent of world population.To contextualize this inequality, Oxfam refers to the housing problem in Spain and estimates that “the five future billionaires on the planet will have so much money that they will be able to buy all the houses in the country”.
In contrast, attention is drawn to the fact that the “working class fights to survive.” "Those who live in poverty around the world continue to face multiple crises, as pandemic scars are still with us in the form of priceless debt, lower salaries, and much higher food prices."
In addition, “conflicts are also increasing, which contributes to poverty, hunger and inequality”, without forgetting “the enormous human impact of climate degradation that increases every year, with deaths caused by excessive heat, extreme weather conditions and hunger".
Oxfam even says that Donald Trump's re-election as President of the United States last November “gave a huge boost to billionaires' fortunes, while his policies are poised to further fan the flames of inequality”.
The NGO also highlights data from the World Bank in its most recent report on poverty, which states that “if current growth rates are maintained and inequality does not decrease, it will take more than a century to end poverty”. The document shows that “if we reduce inequality, poverty could be eliminated three times faster”.
One of the highlights goes to the contribution of women to the wealth of the few. “Racialized women living in poverty, especially those in the 'global south', continue to subsidize the global economy. It is estimated that every day women contribute 12.5 billion of unpaid work hours, adding at least 10.8 trilions of dollars in the global economy. ” In this context, “the economic contribution of its care work is three times higher than the financial value of the world technological industry”.
A new colonialism
It is true that the decolonization of regions colonized by European powers began to occur more strongly after the Bandung Conference in 1955, but signs of power imbalance between people and countries persist, which explain, in part, the wealth inequality that occurs. today.
The idea of ​​new colonialism, in the sense that regions such as Europe or North America continue to explore southern countries, especially the least developed, is well patent in the Oxfam report. “The rise of a new oligarchy in which inheritance, clientelism and monopoly power generate extreme wealth. Without control, we are about to see the greatest transfer of the greatest generational wealth in human history, hardly earned, hardly taxed. ”
What is happening today is a panorama of “billionaire colonialism”, describes Oxfam, with “the transfer of wealth not only to the ultra-rich, but disproportionately to the ultra-rich in the Global North”. There is a “reckoning with colonialism not only as a history of brutal wealth extraction, but also as a powerful force driving extreme levels of inequality today.”
Oxfam also draws attention to a new wave of colonialism evidence in the actions of the major economic and financial institutions that decide the direction of the global economy, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations (UN) and the World Bank. "Global institutions, financial markets, and multinational companies, all shaped by colonialism and mastery of rich countries, continue to facilitate the south-north transfer of dollar trillion every year."
For Oxfam, the UN, IMF and World Bank “were created 80 years ago, close to the end of the historical colonial period, and their unequal governance has changed little since then”.
“G7 countries continue to deter 41 percent of the vote in the IMF and the World Bank, although they are less than ten percent of the world's population. World Bank and IMF leaders continue to be decided by the United States and Europe, respectively. Likewise, European countries and other global nations have 47 percent of the total seats on the UN Security Council, although they represent only 17 percent of the world's population. ”
It should be noted that "the IMF and the World Bank continue to have a huge influence on the global economic system and, in particular, on the economic policies of low and medium-low countries." These entities, according to Oxfam, "systematically insist on the implementation of cuts in critical expenses."
One of the examples presented is from the IMF, which "requires debtor countries to prioritize the payment of debts to creditors above all and implement policies that include privatization, liberalization of trade and reduction of public deficits to obtain new loans." "These policies impair access to quality education and affordable prices and health care, with a negative impact on public health," he adds.
What to do?
Oxfam proposes a series of measures to mitigate growing inequality between the richest and the rest of the planet, suggesting, among others, that governments commit to ensuring that the yield of the ten percent of the population will not exceed the 40 Poor percent, both national and world level.
The report also establishes an increase in taxes on large fortunes, through an international tax system conceived by the UN, and the elimination of tax havens.

This news will be created by the public hiring proposal, approved in general on January 11 last year.
According to the explanations of Ella Lei, president of the commission, the possibility of so-called “competitive negotiation” with candidates is a new feature of the law, but can only be used in three situations: when all public tender proposals are rejected, although without changing substantially the tender specifications, when the work is too complex, making it impossible to establish a previous price for the proposals, or when the nature of the work makes it impossible to fix a price in advance.
According to the newspaper Ou Mun, the proposed law establishes that when the Administration chooses to avoid public tendering, and requests proposals from a certain number of companies, the consultation must be carried out with at least five companies. However, Ella Lei indicated that deputies are concerned that the alleged “randomness” of the companies consulted is not guaranteed or results in a fair procedure, so this aspect will be discussed with the Executive.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:49:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Press | Sam Hou Fai stresses diversity and internationalization</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/imprensa-sam-hou-fai-frisa-diversidade-e-internacionalizacao/</link><description>The message was left by the Chief Executive during the dinner offered to the media in Portuguese and English. Sam Hou Fai highlighted the link established with the international community
 
The Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, considered that the media in Portuguese and English play a role as a link with the international community. The message was left during the traditional dinner offered to the media.
According to the Social Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai stated that “Portuguese and English language media is an important example of Macao's cultural diversity and internationalization”. The government leader said they hoped these bodies “also proceed with the good performance of the international link, enhancing the advantages of linguistic, cultural and international ties, continuing to exterior to Macao's uniqueness, resulting from the fusion of oriental and western cultures. ”.
With this hope, the Government leader believes that the media will contribute to “elevating the role of Macau as a platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, as well as a platform for openness to the outside world at a higher level”.
The chief executive also said he hoped that "the sector will continue to increase its development and to promote, along with the government, internationalization, so that Macao is more attractive and has a greater global influence." As such, Sam Hou Fai expects to transmit “abroad, through professional reports, the 'Macao Experiences' and the 'Wisdom of China', favoring better clarification and avoiding misunderstandings and bad interpretations of the foreigner, thus making the field in an important window of objective, rational and genuine exchange of oriental and western cultures ”.
Protected freedoms
In the hopes expressed at dinner with representatives of the media, Sam also asked for oversight of “government action”.
In view of the year 2024, Sam Hou Fai made a positive assessment of the media's actions, indicating that “they played the important role of linking with the Portuguese and English communities abroad in accessing information about Macau”. Furthermore, he indicated that they “made good use of the unique advantages of the region, resulting from its proximity to Mainland China and its openness to the world” and made “the reality and development of Macau known and provided first-hand information to the public about the successful implementation of the one country, two systems principle.”
The government leader also indicated that “freedom of the press is fully guaranteed by the Basic Law and the Macao SAR Press Law, which is why it will be safeguarded, as always and in accordance with the law, by the Macao SAR Government, which will support the sector in the correct fulfillment of its duties, in news coverage and access to news, actively collaborating in the efficient exchange of information between the various public services and the sector”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:47:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Caeal | Chief Executive received delegation to accompany elections</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/caeal-chefe-do-executivo-recebeu-delegacao-para-acompanhar-eleicoes/</link><description>The Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, received a delegation from the Electoral Affairs Committee of the Legislative Assembly to attend a presentation on the preparation of elections for future deputies.

In a speech before the Portuguese consul and Forum Macau delegates, Sam Hou Fai highlighted the importance of the guidelines proposed by Xi Jinping during his visit to Macau
 
Macau and Portuguese-speaking countries must strengthen business cooperation. This was one of the main highlights of the Chief Executive's speech at the reception dinner for the consuls general in the Macao SAR and the delegates from Portuguese-speaking countries at Forum Macau.
Sam Hou Fai appealed to the improvement of the “various exchange and cooperation mechanisms” between Macao and the Lusophone markets, to “comprehensively leverage exchange and cooperation at the private sector level”.
“The delegations that come from your countries to visit Macau will always be warm,” said the government leader. Sam promised to support the travel of Lusophone delegations to mainland China, including the in-depth cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Hengqin and the great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay.
Sam defended the need for “pragmatic cooperation (…) in the various areas” and stressed the importance of the new Macao Forum Action Plan until 2027.
In addition to the connection with Portuguese -speaking countries, the leader of the Government of MSAR pointed to cooperation between Macao and Southeast Asia countries.
Highlighting the friendly relationship between Macau and Portuguese-speaking countries and that the Macao SAR is the only region in the world that has Chinese and Portuguese as its official languages, Sam Hou Fai stressed the need to “boost joint development characterized by equality, cooperation and mutual benefits , comprehensively raising the level of Sino-Lusophone cooperation”.
Close friends
In a speech marked by multiple references to the “important speeches” of President Xi Jinping, which Sam Hou Fai points out as the key to opening a new phase of governance in the Macao SAR, the leader of the Executive says that “a new scenario of exchange and cooperation has been created ” between Portuguese-speaking and Southeast Asian countries, China and the Macao SAR.
Regarding Southeast Asia, Sam Hou Fai highlighted the Philippines. “The MSAR and the countries of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, which are geographically close, have close economic and commercial cooperation, with intense exchange of people and in the cultural area, being traditionally good neighbors and good partners.”
The official highlighted the “valuable contributions to the socio-economic development of Macau” of the Filipino community, which, according to the 2021 Census, corresponded to around 5 percent of the total population of Macau, being the second largest community in the Region after to the Chinese community.”
"This good base of traditional cooperation," as Sam Hou Fai categorized it, is a factor to "grasp new opportunities, explore more potential cooperation in all strands."</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:22:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Continental Affairs Council warns of “possible risks” in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/conselho-de-assuntos-continentais-avisa-para-possiveis-riscos-em-macau/</link><description>Taiwan has advised people not to travel to Hong Kong or Macau during the Lunar New Year period, due to “possible security risks”. Taiwan's Continental Affairs Council (MAC) recalled that the travel alert for the two territories remains at “orange level”, the second highest level.
The body responsible for relations with China justifies the warning “taking into account changes to the situation in Hong Kong and Macau and in response to local laws and regulations and law enforcement methods”. “Citizens are advised to avoid non-essential travel” to the two cities, including in transit, due to “possible risks to safety and individual rights”, added the MAC, in a statement.
The Lunar New Year is the main party of Chinese families, equivalent to Christmas in Western countries, and this year in Taiwan includes a period of nine days of holidays between January 25 and February 2.
The MAC advised the population to register, in advance, in a database created for Taiwanese traveling to the Interior, Hong Kong or Macau and recalled that there are hotlines to support citizens.
Records rising
Although not mandatory, the number of Taiwanese who registered to travel to Chinese territory between January and October 2024 increased by around 14 times compared to the previous year, according to data released by the organization in December.
Registrations for Hong Kong and Macau “exceeded five times the total for the same period last year”, said the MAC.
China “continued to adopt and change national security laws, which led to several incidents, involving the arbitrary detention, arrest and interrogation of Taiwanese citizens in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau”, said the organization.
In September, the MAC said a Taiwanese conglomerate leader Formosa Plastics had been under "border control" for 18 days, a kind of measure that prevents him from leaving the country.
Taiwan raised its travel alert level in mid-June and advised the population to avoid China, Hong Kong and Macau, after Beijing threatened to execute people considered “staunch defenders” of Taiwanese independence.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Financial reserve | Close to the best annual record since the pandemic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/23/reserva-financeira-perto-do-melhor-registo-anual-desde-pandemia/</link><description>After the pandemic years, the RAEM's financial reserve is close to registering the best year, with gains of 37.5 billion patacas in the first 11 months of the year
 
Macau's financial reserve is close to recording its best year since the pandemic, after earning 37.5 billion patacas in the first 11 months of 2024, it was announced yesterday. According to data from the Macau Monetary Authority (AMCM), this could be the highest annual increase since 2019, when the value of the reserve increased by 70.6 billion patacas.
The Macao SAR's financial reserve gained 22.2 billion patacas in 2023, after having lost almost four times that amount in the previous year.
The value of the reserve amounted to almost 618 billion patacas at the end of November, the highest value since March 2022, according to data published in the Official Bulletin. Still, the value remains far from the record of 663.6 billion patacas reached in February 2021, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The territory's financial reserve gained 4.63 billion patacas in November, compared to October, the month in which it suffered the second drop in 2024.
The value of the extraordinary reserve at the end of November was 431.9 billion patacas and the basic reserve, equivalent to 150 percent of Macau's public budget for this year, was 153.4 billion patacas.
Budget forecast surplus
The budget for 2024 provided for a 1.4 percent increase in total expenses to 105.9 billion patacas. The financial reserve is mostly composed of deposits and current accounts in the amount of 243.2 billion, credit securities of 121.6 billion patacas and up to 247.1 billion patacas in subcontracted investments.
In January 2024, AMCM stressed that investments yielded to the financial reserve nearly 29 billion patacas by 2023, corresponding to a profitability rate of 5.2 percent.
This although, by 2023, the region's authorities transferred nearly 10.4 billion from the financial reserve to the public budget.
Macau's budget for 2024 predicted the return of surpluses in public accounts, anticipating a positive balance of 1.17 billion patacas, without “the need to resort to the financial reserve”.</description><pubDate>2025-01-23 00:17:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Obligations | Direct link created with Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/obrigacoes-criada-ligacao-directa-com-hong-kong/</link><description>The Macau Monetary and Exchange Authority (AMCM) joined its counterpart Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to create a service connecting Macau to the neighboring region's stock exchange.

This entity is entirely detained by AMCM.
The objective of the creation of CMU is to “promote the integrated development of the obligations of the two regions”.

This month, several meetings were held to analyze the President's speeches, the most significant being the thematic seminar that took place in Beijing on the 9th, where Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Labor Office of the Committee Central of the Communist Party of China and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office at the State Council, delivered important messages. But regardless of the activities and seminars held, the key to improving Macau's development is the action of the SAR Government.
Although the integration of Macao and Hengqin is the goal to reach in the next 25 years, the Macao Peninsula, Taipa and Coloane are currently the areas under the direct jurisdiction of Rae de Macao. Hengqin, being an area for “improving the new trading, construction and joint management system and sharing results” between Guangdong and Macau, remains a cooperation zone in China that aims to facilitate the economic diversification of Macao to its official integration in the MSAR . In late October 2024, more than 16,000 Macao residents lived in the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macao in Hengqin, but the vast majority still live in Macao.
Since the “great consumption award in Macao” ended in December last year, there were continuous requests from residents to resume the benefit plan for electronic consumption to compensate for increased cost of living.
However, local stores, affected by increased consumption of residents in mainland China and the increase in rents of rentals, seek way to try to survive. Although tourists from the interior of China arrive in groups, and do young visitors flood the tourist attractions to take photos, what tangible benefits bring to small and medium -sized local companies? In addition to increasing close contact between residents and compatriots of China in public transport, which other economic benefits come from these tourists?
The expectations and hopes for Macau of the national leader, President Xi, are genuine. If Macau performs well, it could become an exemplary model of the “One Country, Two Systems” principle, valuing the city and allowing it to stand out. As for the “three expectations” and “four hopes” highlighted by President Xi, I have a personal opinion.
Macau is a bridge that connects Chinese culture and Western culture today and has established its position within the framework of national development as “a center, a platform and a base”. To contribute to the construction of the Greater Bay Area, Macau's main task must be to safeguard its characteristics. Only in this way can you have the opportunity to make a difference on the international scene. Being patriotic and loving Macau are certainly the basic requirements for Macau to recruit capable people. Those who grew up in the city would not want to see its resources run out.
However, ideas range from person to person, but as long as they do not endanger the interests of Macau or pose a danger to the country, they should be seen as patriots. There are dictated as “the greatness comes from an open mind”, “the one who listens to all parts gets a clear view of the situation” and “only when each drop of water is retained if a river and the confluence of the rivers an ocean can form ”.
In the Chinese classic “I Ching”, you can read “just as celestial bodies never lose energy while describing their orbits, we must also fight constantly for our improvement”, which means that nothing in the world is unchanging. To drive Macau towards the future, we need capable individuals and entrepreneurs.
As for the proper diversification of Macao's economy, the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Hengqin will undoubtedly be an excellent platform. In the present economic structure of Macao, with the diversification of “1 + 4” industries, the game sector plays a crucial role. In the future, it will be more important to redouble efforts to achieve the progressive development of other sectors than to reduce the scale of game sector operations to achieve and proper diversification of Macao's economy.
Regarding the improvement of the level of governance, it is essential to avoid “nepotism”, widen “the circles of friends” of the governance team and to encourage and support public monitoring of government performance, so that effective and effective governance.
The reforms are the previous condition for opening and opening is the result of the reforms. Taking advantage of Macao's experience on the road of internationalization allows the Government of Mashere to help transform the great bay into an “open platform abroad”. If the Government of the MSAR can protect the way of life of citizens they will not naturally have reasons for complaints. If the Government of the MSAR ensures employment, society will not fall into chaos. A fair and equitable society will certainly be peaceful!</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:28:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Geogogogosronomy and Macau Creative City in UNESCO Gastronomy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/a-geogastronomia-e-macau-cidade-criativa-em-gastronomia-da-unesco/</link><description>“Geogostronomy Offers An Innovative Lens through the Exploration of the Deep-Rooted Cultural Connections Between Food, Landscape and People. The Synergy of the Mix and Match From Different Areas Creates A Magical Creativity to Outstand the Taste of Memories Which Seated as the Greatest Piece of a Region. As part of the UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy in Macao, Lisbon Macau Aim to Bring Together the Tradition and Innovation of Food and Fun Places to Foster the Global Appreciation of Macao. ”
Dr. Christine Hong Barbosa.
Vice President of Marketing &amp; Retail Development of Lisbon
Geogastronomy is a term that merges geography and gastronomy, emphasizing the relationship between food culture and its geographic roots. This concept highlights how local ingredients, cooking methods and cultural influences converge to shape regional cuisines. By examining local cuisine, researchers and enthusiasts can gain insight into a community's history, culture and identity. Geogastronomy thus serves as a bridge that connects culinary practices to environmental and sociopolitical contexts.
Macau, located on the southern coast of China, is a distinctive example of geogastronomy in action. Its position as a historic trading port and melting pot provides a unique setting for its culinary evolution. The intricate mix of Portuguese and Chinese influences in Macanese cuisine shows how geography can influence food culture, leading to a diverse range of flavors, ingredients and cooking techniques. Macau's food scene is a vibrant tapestry woven from various cultural threads, particularly those of Chinese and Portuguese origin. The city has iconic dishes such as Macanese curry, cod and authentic custard tarts (which cannot be confused with the egg tarts that fill the streets and in due time we will reveal how this phenomenon came about), each one reflecting its influences. unique histories.
The fusion of spices, aromatic herbs and cooking styles creates a distinct gastronomic identity. The use of seasonal and locally sourced ingredients highlights Macau's connection to its geographic environment, reinforcing the principles of geogastronomy. The historical context of Macau's gastronomy is remarkable. Portuguese colonization introduced new ingredients and culinary techniques that became part of Chinese food traditions. This cultural exchange resulted in a rich variety of dishes that combine the best of both worlds. For example, the use of cumin, curry powder and coconut milk reflects Portuguese culinary practices, while techniques such as wok frying signify traditional Chinese cooking methods.
As a result, Macao's cuisine developed in a sophisticated mixture rather than a mere amalgam of the influences that influence it. Several influential personalities play a crucial role in the formation of Macau's culinary scene. Notable chefs and restorers devoted their efforts to the preservation and innovation of Macanese cuisine. The renowned heads António Neves Coelho and José Avillez are known to modernize the traditional Portuguese dishes, maintaining their authenticity. Your approach serves as an example of how bosses can honor their culinary inheritance, adapting to contemporary trends. They emphasize the use of local ingredients and the appreciation of traditional recipes. Through their initiatives, they promote the concept of geogostronomy as a method for preserving the culinary heritage.
Their work exemplifies the vital role that chefs and culinary professionals play within the creative city. The designation of “Macau as a UNESCO Creative City in Gastronomy” in 2017 further highlights the importance of culinary innovation and heritage. This recognition emphasizes the city's commitment to maintaining and promoting its rich culinary history while promoting a sustainable future. The program encourages collaboration between local chefs, artisans and academics, promoting a gastronomic culture that reflects Macau's mixed identity. The designation of “Macau as a UNESCO Creative City in Gastronomy” had a far-reaching impact on several facets of Macanese society, namely tourism and local economies, which slowed down during the Covid-19 pandemic and are beginning to revive.
Lisboeta Macau, for example, has made a notable contribution with its official vision being “to be a themed Macau tourist destination that combines iconic landmarks from its collective memory with unique Sino-Portuguese culture to promote its unique cultural identity . Lisboeta Macau proudly aligns with the vision of Macau as a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy. Macau's rich cultural history, which combines Portuguese and Chinese influences, creates a unique and dynamic gastronomic landscape. Lisbonite Macau believes that this recognition as a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy not only celebrates the fusion of flavors and traditions, but also highlights the importance of preserving and innovating local food heritage. With a strong commitment to preserving Macanese heritage and promoting innovative culinary experiences, Lisboeta Macau takes advantage of the company's strengths to promote Macanese-Portuguese culture, supporting cross-border integration “Turismo+Gastronomia” through collaboration with the famous Chef Portuguese António Coelho at “Angela's Café and Lounge”, highlighting the fusion of Macau's Portuguese-Chinese heritage with traditional Portuguese cuisine, combining culinary techniques Portuguese classics with innovative creations to offer citizens and visitors a memorable gastronomic experience and contributing to Macau's growing reputation as a vibrant gastronomic hub, in line with its economic development, attracting food enthusiasts, tourists and industry professionals”.
“Lisbon Macao is committed to supporting the Mashely Government strategy to promote the tourism industry, consistently boosting local economic growth through innovation and transionic integration. Lisbon Line Friends Themed Restaurant Macau “Brown &amp; Friends Cafe &amp; Bistro” and the famous “Cejerdy” crab brand joined the 24th Macao Gastronomic Festival, presenting the various local flavors to global tourists and highlighting them Macao dynamic strengths as a vibrant platform as a creative city of gastronomy from UNESCO. In addition, Lisbon Macau aims to take advantage of the synergies of the “Macao Outdoor Show Space” to present the “Lisbon Night-The Night Market with Macaenses”, encouraging the economic development of the community and immersing visitors in a distinct mixture of Traditional culture and modern innovation, showing the essence of the culture of macaense and Portuguese inspiration, further reinforcing the night economy of Macao. These collaborations help reinforce Macau's position as a creative city that values ​​both culinary tradition and innovation, ensuring long -term sustainability of its gastronomic scene, while promoting economic growth and cultural exchange. ”
Such a distinction, he positioned Macau as a global gastronomic destination, attracting gastronomy enthusiasts and tourists eager for experiencing his unique culinary offers. The tourism sector benefited significantly with this designation. With the increase in international interest in the gastronomy of Macao, several festivals and gastronomic events were organized to present local dishes. These events not only celebrate gastronomic culture, but also offer entrepreneurs and platform companies to show their products. This increase in tourism translates into an increase in economic opportunities for local inhabitants, including the creation of employment in the sectors of hospitality, restoration and homemade food production or almost, weigh the crisis that Macau lives with the low purchasing power of residents that It decreased to the detriment of the continent and the tourist from there that it has reduced equally for the same reasons.
Furthermore, the UNESCO designation leads the government to sponsor initiatives aimed at supporting sustainable practices in the gastronomy sector. Programs that encourage zero-waste cooking demonstrate a commitment to sustainability and community involvement. This paradigm shift reflects a growing awareness of the interconnections between gastronomy, environmental management and social responsibility. Culinary education is another critical aspect of Macau’s culinary narrative. The educational institutions and culinary schools that must be created urgently, not just reserved for the University of Tourism, will play a fundamental role in training the next generation of chefs and culinary professionals. By integrating traditional Macanese cuisine into their curricula, these institutions encourage the appreciation of local gastronomic culture among students.
This educational approach also encourages innovation, as young chefs experiment with their heritage, breathing new life into traditional recipes. Cultural preservation is fundamental to maintaining Macau's rich culinary history. Initiatives aimed at documenting traditional recipes and cooking techniques through oral histories and publications ensure these culinary traditions are safeguarded for future generations. The role of grassroots organizations and community projects focused on culinary heritage reflects the collaborative spirit of geogastronomy, in which local communities actively engage in preserving their unique food cultures.
Despite the positive impacts of its UNESCO designation, Macau's gastronomic sector faces challenges that deserve attention. A significant concern is the potential dilution of traditional practices due to globalization and mass tourism. With the proliferation of international restaurants and fast-food chains, there is a risk that local culinary traditions will be overshadowed, leading to a loss of cultural identity. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a serious impact on the hospitality and tourism sectors. Restrictions on travel and dining have forced many local businesses to adapt quickly or risk closing.
Although some establishments have adopted innovative approaches, such as delivery services and virtual cooking classes, others have struggled to survive in a difficult economic scenario. Another challenge lies in the balance between modernization and culinary authenticity. As heads experience melting kitchens and modern kitchen techniques, concerns may arise regarding the integrity of traditional dishes. Finding a balance between innovation and preservation will be essential to maintain the authenticity of Macanese cuisine. Looking to the future, several developments may emerge in the macao gastronomy sector. One of the predictable trends is the growing emphasis on sustainable practices.
As consumers become increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their eating choices, Macao's restaurants and the likes can give priority to local and organic supply. This change promotes a sense of community and responsibility to the environment. In addition, technology is likely to remodel the culinary landscape. Advances in food production, preservation and distribution can provide growth and innovation opportunities. For example, using digital platforms can improve marketing efforts and reinforce connections between consumers and local producers. Innovations such as vertical agriculture and aquaponia can also offer sustainable solutions to supply ingredients in a densely populated city.
Collaboration between culinary professionals, tourism authorities and the governments of Macau and Mainland provinces will play a crucial role in shaping the evolution of Macau's gastronomic identity. Joint initiatives aimed at promoting food culture, organizing workshops and showcasing local ingredients can raise the profile of Macanese cuisine on the global stage. These collaborative efforts promote community engagement and can mitigate the risks posed by globalization and the pandemic. The future of Macau's gastronomy looks promising, with a growing emphasis on sustainability and innovation. The collaborative spirit of geogastronomy can guide the city in navigating these challenges, ensuring that its rich culinary heritage endures as it adapts to a changing world.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:52:06</pubDate></item><item><title>The face of Dom Dinis</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/o-rosto-de-dom-dinis/</link><description>It was now seven hundred years ago on the seventh of January that the most emblematic king of a country absent of features and forms passed away, which in aesthetic and anatomical terms we cannot consider anything emblematically representative, or even dream of the physical form of certain many other representatives, but with him , it happened. We saw him like a Janus reborn in time (however, leaving behind what could have been his young face) and it was with some emotion that we looked at him, and this will not be erased from the collective memory, which was never alien to his charm. .
Dom Dinis is a bit like legends and having a face fills us with excitement and strange enthusiasm, that, on the exact day of his serious hour, we had it. The region that crowned him is full of those faces, that Atlantic coast of Pinhal and Coastal is emblematic in physiognomic opinion, and these things are aspects to add to the very impact of the moment- he came from a bruh that Avalon's might still complain- they would still complain- and had the undeniable serenity of a poet.
A monarch may be, or not, serene, from a political, state perspective, therefore, but in him we feel something else that does not come in the maps of the references of his own status. Legend has it that it was red, but what came to us was that thirteenth -century being who had died at sixty -three, an age considered of great longevity for the time, which his buried body did not represent as clear the other man who It was, and it was the possible image taken from his sepulcher from Odivelas that came to us as a strange appearance that has silenced us and forced us to a feeling Vénia.
His blue eyes, which are said to have had greenish reflections, his forgotten blond white hair, were what remained and dazzled us: and if we portrayed his grandfather Afonso grandson the harp by which our hearts still align today. The Songs of Saint Mary must also have these blue eyes, that Aragon in his funeral insignia was still his tomb, and this all leaves us, of course, quite thoughtful. He was the sixth Portuguese king, and the quinas will never be able to exercise such order in the demand for their numbers. Perhaps it would have been our Star of David without the recent aspects that define it, when it still, and lovingly, called “its Jews” to itself. He also called the Moors, Templars, and all those who fit his heart.
We address him with the respect intact from seven hundred years later, that our matrix does not stop at roses, nor are our dreams freer than the profound nature of his sense of mission, where he fulfilled and was master, still loving all the lands of his kingdom the women who inspired him: where Afonso Sanches also emerged, a bastard son who followed in the footsteps of a father who cultivated the language and imposed it for the first time as an official language. Then he had a grandson called Pedro, to whom he had given good luck at his birth with gold coins and other recitals so that his voice would be clear as befitted a monarch, but the boy would later be very stuttering, a lover of his grandfather, and the most beautiful prince in the world.
His excremental son, Afonso IV, had battles with tears and some blood, but Dom Dinis did not run away from battles as a man of his time, and his nature must have suffered from the rudeness and blows of these things. He was born on October 9, 1261, was acclaimed king in 1279, and died in 1325 on this January 7, so full of bad memories. We must read it to know how to sing, know the green, smell the pine trees, and know how to build new boats. He also had a truculent profile, a large nose and a tender and tenacious countenance. But the spark that symbolizes beings no science yet knows how to reproduce, identify, and demonstrate as a pragmatic domain.

The man was only arrested in 2020 for trying to photograph the legs of three women under their skirts, in a supermarket. When he was arrested, the police analyzed his computer and found videos of his wife's rape. Because this crime occurred over a long time, the police were only able to identify 50 of the rapists. The husband was eventually sentenced to 20 years in prison. Although the other 50 defendants claimed that it was all part of sexual games carried out with the couple's connivance, the court did not accept their arguments and they received sentences ranging from 3 to 15 years in prison.
Articles 222-23 of the French Penal Code stipulate that rape is “any type of sexual intercourse against the will of one of the parties, through threat, violence, coercion or accident.” This definition clearly identifies the elements that constitute the crime of rape. Simply put, rape is sexual intercourse with someone against their will and is therefore an assault. In the present case, the husband caused his wife to be raped by third parties, which constitutes the crime of “helping other people to rape.” The husband is primarily responsible and the rapists are accomplices.
What kind of people are these defendants? Are they kind? Are they perverse? We all know the answer, there's no need to say what it is. Morally, the husband is the one who should be held most responsible because he had an obligation to take care of the family, to protect his wife and not let any harm happen to her. How can someone drug a woman to the point of leaving her unconscious and allowing her to be raped by others? This man fulfilled neither the legal obligation of loyalty to his wife nor the moral obligation to love and care for her. No wonder several people made comments online like “A very dangerous husband.”
The World Health Organization proposed the application of the concept “intimate partner violence” to define aggressive and controlling behaviors against former or current intimate partners, such as physical violence, psychological violence, stalking, harassment, financial control, sexual violence, etc. But these behaviors also indicate psychological disorders. This case constitutes extreme sexual violence. Perhaps, while serving his sentence, this man could receive counseling to help him correct these behaviors and resolve his psychological problems.
There is another point that we must pay attention to when analyzing the case. During the period in which these incidents took place, the husband repeatedly used drugs to make his wife unconscious and then invited other men to rape her, which represents an extremely serious situation. In addition to being raped by many men, the woman was drugged many times.  Drugging her into unconsciousness is a serious criminal act. If she had died, her husband could have been charged with murder. Judging by the facts presented, the husband only wanted to satisfy his bestiality and did not even think about how dangerous his actions were. During the 20 years you will spend in prison, you will have the opportunity to reflect, try to be more understanding and stop acting thoughtlessly.
After the case was exposed, the woman, as a victim, decided to request the divorce. Perhaps in this way, not seeing each other again again, the problem can be solved. The woman also has to forget the past, start a new life and face each day that ahead with a positive attitude.
In addition, this woman did not choose anonymity, but for revealing her identity. It allowed the court to show during the trial a series of videos of its violations. We can imagine that, before the public, the transmission of a video of their own violation, not only exposes nudity, but also shows all abuses. This type of images causes a lot of discomfort and the woman had to accept the different interpretations that people made after watching the movies. This spiritual pain cannot be described by words. However, she just said, "The violator has to be ashamed." The woman decided to face the situation boldly and calmly, which is a rarity. I fear that not even men of great status and talent can behave in this way and have so much psychological strength.
The woman's permission for the videos to be shown may have another purpose. As some of the suspects have not yet been found, it is not known whether other copies may exist. After this case has become public, even if these copies exist in someone's possession, they cannot be used to threaten them and the issue is closed. Someone who possesses these videos cannot even think of using them to threaten you or cause you any harm.
With the condemnation and imprisonment of the husband, the matter must be temporarily closed. The behavior of this man destroyed family happiness. The couple had three children. Blood ties between a father and his children can never be cut. How will this father solve the problem with his children? The man is 72 years old and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. It will be released when you have 92. Perhaps the news that leaves 20 years from now can answer this question.
Next week, we will continue the analysis of this case.

The lunar new year of the serpent starts next Wednesday and, once again, opens a period of holidays that will bring many tourists to Macao. According to the assistant professor at the University of Macao (one) Glenn McCartney, holidays associated with Chinese New Year will be important to “measure and evaluate the interest and game -related expenses, as well as regional visits, given the investment in events at the city's scale and the expected large number of visitors, ”he told HM.
“From a business point of view, the fundamental question is how the number of visitors translates into actual expenses and the impact this brings to small and medium-sized businesses, such as restaurants, bars and shops, whether they are overnight visitors or of day-trippers returning to Hong Kong or Zhuhai on the same day.”
Therefore, “there are expectations that the occupancy rate of Macau hotels will be high, and there will be some day visitors who will return to stay in Zhuhai”, he estimated.
More than a million
Since in the same year's same year, the territory received almost 1.4 million tourists during the 8 -day Chinese New Year, it is expected for the coming days “a high number of visitors”, “like this year The Chinese New Year begins on January 29, Macau may benefit from the increase in the number of tourists in the previous and later weekends. ”
But Glenn McCartney also highlights other factors that can enhance tourism numbers, “since we have watched greater accessibility and ease of border passage as an important factor since reopening after Covid, for example, with the increase of visitors of Hong Kong through the bridge. ”
Glenn Mccartney also argues that the resorts' promotional activities and street festivities can also attract tourists, with “an important feature of Chinese New Year activities being the 'feedback' component”, with “residents and visitors being able to give their opinion, allowing authorities to understand the impact of these Chinese New Year activities.”
“This type of feedback can be a valuable source to improve various aspects of Chinese New Year's organization, operations and marketing in order to analyze current and potential visitors in the future. The use of networks can be part of the impact analysis assessment of Chinese New Year's promotions, ”he said.
For these days Helena de Senna Fernandes, director of Tourism Services, said she expects a daily average of 185 thousand visitors, of which only eight thousand are expected to be international. The main attraction during this period in Macau will be the Lunar New Year Parade, held on January 31st and repeated on February 8th.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 01:50:39</pubDate></item><item><title>ZELENSKY VS ZELENSKY</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us around the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we tell him: High There we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You haven't said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - Madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails about sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is managed to seek a reason for Things abroad to us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed with scholastic rigor stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicidou -If and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ that had not entered the story. »
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when you announced the Nobel Prize in this year's literature, I couldn't help but remember this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, compared to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large newspaper Daily National Wrote wrote Five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize of Literature was awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete unknown. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but that just gives me the comfort of knowing that the world isn't a soap opera where everyone know and the joy of recognizing that the yardstick of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary, it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that doesn't take away from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written the “ Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Award had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her novel “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Coast.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and writers from the north Macua-Mozambican, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technology and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché "all different, all the same", a return to "diplomacy", given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that "we are unified because we share the same nature" but highlights simply that we “do not yet share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funeral trips for countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - which starts still awaits us, that secret spells we will still have to overcome, what horrors will be erected before our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that can satisfy your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and imposing, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the nocturnal whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
Men should refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the fields will perish as a result. cultivated, for it the meek animals will be beheaded, for it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and for it the pride of countries will be destroyed.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that gag, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in relationships were limited. human beings, or if it simply lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, which is then declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), there is a lack of world in Pascoaes. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but a also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at eight years old – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Evidently, they are the two 'Bigger Than Life', but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my rank of hatter at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, in a different way, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE

The Senior Officials Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) announced that it has transferred the case to the Public Prosecutor's Office, which has the power to formally charge a South Korean head of state.
The CIO considers that Yoon conspired with the then Minister of National Defense, Kim Yong-hyun, and other military officers to start a mutiny, declaring martial law on the night of December 3rd. It further argues that Yoon abused his power by sending troops to the National Assembly (parliament) to prevent deputies from revoking martial law.
The Public Prosecutor's Office now has 11 days to decide whether or not to initiate the requested process. If Yoon is found guilty of leading an insurrection, a crime for which a president does not have immunity in the country, he could be sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty.
Yoon is in custody at the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, south of Seoul, since January 15. The Constitutional Court is simultaneously made a judgment to determine whether or not to ratify the dismissal approved by parliamentarians on December 14.
If South Korea's highest court confirms the impeachment, early presidential elections must be called within 60 days of the court's decision. Yoon refuses to testify in the investigation into the alleged crime of rebellion.
Yoon Suk-Youol surprised the country on December 3 by declaring martial law, a measure reminiscent of black days of the South Korean military dictatorship and that justified with the intention of protecting the country from “North Korean Communist forces” and “Eliminate elements hostile to the state”.
Pressured by deputies and thousands of protesters, Yoon was forced to revoke the decision hours later.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:30:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Afghanistan | Beijing calls for severe punishment for authors of the murder of Chinese citizen</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/afeganistao-pequim-pede-punicao-severa-para-autores-do-assassinio-de-cidadao-chines/</link><description>China yesterday appealed to the Afghan authorities to do an "exhaustive investigation" and "severely punish" those responsible for the murder on Wednesday of a Chinese citizen who worked on a gold mine in Takhar's Afghan province.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said yesterday at a press conference that Beijing is “deeply shocked” with the attack. "China is against all forms of terrorism," said the spokesman, appealing to the "repression of the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations listed by the UN Security Council."
"China will continue to pay close attention to the security situation in Afghanistan and to support Afghan authorities in combating all forms of terrorist violence and maintaining security and stability in the country," Mao added, urging the Afghan government to Take the necessary measures "to ensure the safety of citizens and Chinese organizations in the country."
According to local police, the victim worked in a gold mine in the region, which borders Tajikistan. A local branch of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. China is one of the few international actors that has maintained diplomatic relations with Afghanistan since the Taliban came to power in August 2021.
The two countries share a small international border of just 76 kilometers in the eastern part of the so -called Wajan corridor, a remote passage in the Pamir Range.
Chinese companies, with support from Beijing, have sought to seize opportunities to exploit Afghanistan's vast deposits of undeveloped resources, especially the Mes Aynak mine, which is believed to contain the world's largest copper deposit.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:18:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Commerce | Beijing says rates do not benefit China, USA or the world</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/comercio-pequim-diz-que-taxas-nao-beneficiam-china-eua-ou-o-mundo/</link><description>The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said yesterday that the United States imposition of customs of Chinese goods “would not benefit China, the United States or the world,” in the face of the threats of US leader Donald Trump.
Ministry spokesman He Yadong said at a press conference that his country “has always maintained a consistent position” on increasing rates. “China is willing to work with the US to put economic and trade relations between the two countries in a stable, healthy and sustainable direction,” he said.
Asked whether his ministry has already communicated with the new US administration's commercial team, He said that China “always maintains contact with the competent authorities” in the United States.
Chinese diplomats assured on Wednesday that “there are no winners in a trade war”, after Trump said he was considering imposing 10 percent duties on Chinese imports in retaliation for the flow of fentanyl.
"We are talking about a 10 percent rate based on the fact that they are sending Fentanil to Mexico and Canada," Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.
The Republican leader said that he spoke “the other day” with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and that he told him that he did not want that “crap” in the country. Last year, around 70,000 deaths were recorded in the United States due to the consumption of that synthetic opioid.

Authorities said that, from this year, mutual funds should increase their participation in national actions, called Actions A, at least 10 percent per year, over the next three years.
Commercial insurance funds will have to invest 30 percent of their new annual premiums in equity markets from this year, they added.
“This means that at least several hundred billion yuan of long-term funds will be added [to the stock market] every year,” said Wu Qing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
“The implementation of the various measures in the plan will further increase the capital allocation capacity of medium and long-term funds, constantly expand the scale of investment, improve the supply and structure of funds in the capital market and consolidate good conditions for the recovery of the capital market”, he explained.
The Chinese Communist Party announced this measure just before China's biggest holiday of the year, the Lunar New Year, which begins on Wednesday, January 29. This is a time when families tend to increase spending on meals, travel and cash gifts for children and young adults.
Hong Kong and Shanghai markets climbed after the announcement, with the Shanghai Index composite initially winning about 1.5 percent, although in the middle of the session it was rising 0.8 percent. Hang Seng Kong's Hang Seng Index lost its first gains and remained virtually unchanged.
Chinese shareholder markets have reached their maximum value before the Asian financial crisis and have since kept far below that level. The lack of assessment in the prices of actions, along with the fall in property prices, diminished the trust of investors, raising deflationary risks in the second largest economy in the world.
Advances and Reforms
To date, Chinese government efforts to make people spend more and save less have been mitigating success. An initiative to promote the purchase of vehicles and energetically efficient electrodomers through the payment of subsidies to consumers who deliver old versions of these articles increased sales. But action prices stopped after a brief recovery at the end of last year.
Wu stated that pension funds will be required to reformulate the way they evaluate their performance and that companies will be encouraged to perform more action repurchase and pay higher dividends to provide better income.
“This is a very important institutional advance for the entry of medium and long-term funds into the market. It can be said that it solves a problem that has been unresolved for many years”, he added.
"Sales of the main shareholders and the high market volatility have impaired Chinese financial squares," said Law Meng, Chinese Action Analyst at UBS Securities, in a widespread comment yesterday.
"The willingness of long -term investors to participate in the scholarship market has decreased," he added. "The proposal to reform market value management directly addresses this issue, because it is directly related to the sense of gain of investors," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-01-24 02:15:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | Beijing and Brasília highlight “growing consensus” to find a political solution</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/24/ucrania-pequim-e-brasilia-destacam-consenso-crescente-para-encontrar-solucao-politica/</link><description>The two nations continue to effort to find a solution that end the conflict in Ukraine.

“China firmly supports the leadership of the Brazilian President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, so that the Brazilian people explore a path of development, in accordance with their national conditions”, added the minister, while at the same time conveying his “support ” to the South American country during its current presidency of the BRICS bloc of emerging countries.
Wang also expressed his hope of "working with Brazil to defend genuine multilateralism."
Amorim called for efforts to “build a community of common destiny between Brazil and China for a fairer world and a more sustainable planet”. “Brazil and China, as emerging powers, can further strengthen cooperation and play a greater role in maintaining world peace and combating climate change,” stated the special advisor to the Brazilian Presidency.

Sunac, once one of China's largest property developers, became the first company in the sector to successfully restructure its debt issued in domestic markets (“onshore”), after gaining support from creditors.
In a statement sent to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where it is listed, the company stated that the creditors of these obligations, of which around 15.4 billion yuan remained to be paid, approved the plan presented by the company.
The proposal envisaged a reduction to less than half of this amount and offered several options, such as extending the maturity of the bonds until 2034, without the obligation to start paying them until 2029.
Sunac had already been a pioneer among Chinese prosecutors when, in October 2023, he obtained the approval of the Hong Kong court for the agreement he had reached with the creditors to restructure about $ 10.2 billion of debt issued in the markets International (“offshore”).
Debt rating agency Standard&amp;Poor's (S&amp;P) stated at the time that Sunac would pave the way for restructuring the offshore debt of other Chinese developers in similar situations, as it not only sought to prolong obligations to save time, but also included instruments such as debt swaps.
However, on March 10, the state asset manager Cinda filed a settlement against the company in Hong Kong for non -payment of a $ 30 million loan. The first hearing was scheduled for March 19.
This case is distinguished from similar ones, such as those also faced in Hong Kong by giants such as Evergrande or Country Garden, by the fact that the complainant is a Chinese state-owned company and not a private creditor, despite Beijing having repeatedly promised measures to stabilize the real estate market in recent months.
Wound
The promoter's shares in Hong Kong fell more than 25 percent following this news. Yesterday, despite the agreement with onshore creditors, they fell 2.41 percent during the morning part of the session.
Sunac had total liabilities of about 896 billion yuan at the end of the first half of 2024, during which it recorded a net loss of 14.957 billion yuan.
The financial situation of many Chinese real estate companies worsened after Beijing announced, in August 2020, restrictions on access to bank financing for developers who had accumulated a high level of debt, including Evergrande, with liabilities of almost 330 thousand millions of dollars.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:53:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Afghanistan | Taliban claim Chinese citizen was killed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/22/afeganistao-talibas-afirmam-que-cidadao-chines-foi-morto/</link><description>A Chinese citizen was killed in northeastern Afghanistan, a Taliban police spokesman announced yesterday, despite the murder of foreigners being rare in the country, especially since the withdrawal of US troops in 2021.
Police spokesman Mohammed Akbar in Takhar province said the man was killed on Tuesday night by “unknown persons” when he was on his way to Dasht-e-Qala district.
Akbar said the Chinese citizen, nicknamed Li, traveled to an unknown destination with his interpreter and without informing security authorities. The interpreter was not injured in the incident, according to Akbar. “Police began their initial investigation. Stay tuned for more detail, ”added Akbar without providing more information.
A group called the National Mobilization Front claimed responsibility for the murder and said that its combatants targeted the Chinese vehicle. The group claimed that Li was training taliban secret services in monitoring social networking platforms, without evidence.
Asked about the incident, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said yesterday that he is not familiar with the matter. "I believe that the China Embassy in Afghanistan will do everything within your reach to protect the safety of Chinese citizens and we will follow the situation," he said.
China is of particular importance to the Taliban, who are courting foreign investment and regional alliances in the face of their continued isolation on the international stage due to their crackdown on women.</description><pubDate>2025-01-22 23:50:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Francisco Leandro, author and professor at the University of Macau: “Support from the country reinforces Macau’s role as a platform”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/16/francisco-leandro-autor-e-professor-na-universidade-de-macau-apoio-do-pais-reforca-o-papel-de-plataforma-de-macau/</link><description>Gang Wen's interview with China Daily newspaper
Francisco Leandro, an associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Macao, states that the nation's support has allowed the MSA to serve as the Center for Commerce, Investment and Cultural Interactions between China and Portuguese -speaking communities.
 
 
How do you see Macau's development since your return to the homeland? Among the city's achievements, which ones impressed him most? What about its sector, has there been an important progress in the last 25 years?
The 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the Motherland and the creation of the Macau Special Administrative Region constitutes a significant milestone in the region's history, reflecting a successful diplomatic process and demonstrating its current political and economic stability. Currently, the Macau SAR enjoys political stability and is deeply integrated into national development plans. The city's governance under the “one country, two systems” principle allowed it to maintain a high degree of autonomy while aligning with national policies. This integration has facilitated Macau's economic growth, making it a vital part of the country's broader economic strategy.
Macao's socioeconomic development strategy is consecrated in the policy “a center, a platform, a base”. This picture aims to position MSA as a world center of tourism and leisure, reinforcing its attraction as a global tourist destination. In addition, MSAR acts as a platform for economic and commercial cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, promoting international trade and cultural exchange. Rae de Macao is also becoming a base of exchange and cultural cooperation, promoting cultural interactions and the conservation of heritage. This multifaceted approach supports Macao's integration into national development plans and reinforces its global presence. The unique position of MSA as a bridge between China, in particular the great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay, and Portuguese-speaking countries underline their strategic importance.
The concept of “one platform, three centers” highlights Macau’s role in promoting economic and cultural exchange. This platform allowed the city to serve as a platform for trade, investment and cultural interactions, strengthening ties between China and the Portuguese-speaking world.
Macau's development as a tourism and leisure center, along with the promotion of four main industries - conventions and exhibitions, cultural and creative industries, traditional Chinese medicine and modern financial services - diversified its economy. These initiatives not only boosted economic activity, but also reinforced the global attraction of Macau as a tourist destination.
The central government adopted a series of policies for Macao. Is there any specific measure that has benefited your sector? As?
Mainland China and Macau's Enhanced Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) play a crucial role in the Greater Bay Area and in promoting ties with Portuguese-speaking countries. By promoting commercial and economic cooperation, CEPA reinforces the Macao SAR's position as a bridge between China and Portuguese-speaking countries. This agreement facilitates market access, investment and cultural exchange, promoting Macau as an international business center. Furthermore, CEPA supports Macau's integration into the Greater Bay Area, contributing to regional development and economic diversification. This strategic role underscores Macau's importance in the country's broader economic and diplomatic initiatives.
The promotion of higher education in the Macau SAR also played a crucial role in its development. By investing in education and research, Macau contributed to national development objectives and positioned itself as a center of academic excellence. This investment in education allowed the creation of a qualified workforce, essential to sustain economic growth and innovation. The University of Macau is highly regarded in global academic rankings. It was ranked 180th in the World University Rankings 2025 by Times Higher Education, and 245th in the QS World University Rankings 2025. Furthermore, the University of Macau is ranked 262nd in the Best Global Universities by US News &amp; World Report. These rankings reflect the university's commitment to excellence in teaching and research, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence, engineering and social sciences. The university's strong international collaboration and innovative research contribute significantly to its esteemed global position.
This year is the third anniversary of the creation of the Guangdong-Macau in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin. In your opinion, how should Macau continue to take advantage of the advantages of the zone to develop himself and the education sector?
Hengqin's cooperation zone is one of the main objectives of Macao's modernization efforts. This zone has been fundamental to boosting innovation and economic diversification, providing a space for new industries and promoting a narrower integration with the continent. The area exemplifies Macau's commitment to modernization and its strategic role in regional development.
Macao is a unique mix of Chinese and Portuguese cultures. In your opinion, how can this merger help the nation to reinforce communication with the international community and tell the good stories of China?
Macao is a fascinating mix of cultures, where the East meets the West in a unique and harmonious way. His linguistic landscape is a testimony of his multicultural heritage. The Chinese is the official language and the Portuguese language can be used for official purposes, reflecting the historical ties of Macao with Portugal and its Chinese roots. English is also widely spoken, especially in business and tourism, which makes Macau a truly multilingual society.
The Macao SAR legal system is another area in which this cultural mix is ​​evident. Based on the Portuguese civil law system, it was adapted to the local context under the “one country, two systems” principle. This dual legal system allows for a unique blend of Chinese and Western legal traditions, ensuring that Macau's legal environment is familiar to its residents and accessible to international businesses.
Macao's approach to the extrajudicial resolution of commercial conflicts further enhances its multicultural policy. The city offers various arbitration and mediation services that serve both local and international parts, promoting the efficient and friendly resolution of disputes. Macao's open city policy and multicultural attitude are the key to its success as a global center. The city welcomes people from around the world, promoting a diverse and inclusive community. This opening is reflected in its festivals, its gastronomy and their daily lives, where different cultures coexist and enrich each other. Essentially, the mix of language, legal systems and multicultural attitudes of Macau makes it a unique and dynamic place that establishes bridges between cultures and promotes global bonds.
What achievements would you like to see Macau achieve in the next 25 years?
In short, Macao's future is brilliant, with greater integration with mainland China, its central role in international trade, diversified economic growth and a strong global presence. These elements will ensure Macao's continuous success and development at the world scene. The 25th anniversary of Macao's return to the Fatherland celebrates not only a successful diplomatic achievement, but also the continuous contributions of the region to national and world development. Macao's strategic initiatives and their integration in national plans underline their importance as a dynamic region and facing the future.</description><pubDate>2024-12-16 02:20:12</pubDate></item><item><title>António Antunes, cartoonist: “Sometimes I consider myself an artist”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/12/antonio-antunes-cartoonista-as-vezes-considero-me-um-artista/</link><description>It's called Antonio Antunes, but signs her cartoons simply as Antonio. For 50 years it has characterized today using drawing and humor, most of them in the Express. In an interview, the cartoonist, who designed the days of the April 25, regrets that today young cartoonists do not have so many opportunities to sing in their career
This 50-year adventure dedicated to cartoons has been a long one. Did you ever think you would do this for so many years?
No. Things happened, and this is the result. There wasn't even any prospect of a plan. Portugal has not been a country that greatly favors this type of activities.
He did training at António Arroio school during the Estado Novo period. What was it like to learn arts at a time when the country [Portugal] was so gray, with limits to creativity?
We mainly learned techniques, work or composition. Now creativity is another thing. Not only was it very limited, but it is also not something that can be sold. There are no courses to make artists, there are courses that give us notions about composition or painting techniques, or colors. But that alone is not enough. Then there needs to be something beyond what is academic. In the arts there is always something that escapes even if you learn everything. Creativity is a strange thing, because there is no rule.
Is Antonio considered an artist?
(Hesitates) Sometimes I consider it.
There have been many controversial cartoons, including Pope John Paul II with a condom on his nose. Which cartoons forced you to be more flexible or to deal with more pressure?
Maybe it's my happiness, but my problems are never a priori, but rather a posteriori. Until now I have not been very limited in what I can do at the [Expresso] newspaper. Now, when things come out, sometimes they have consequences. In Portugal it was the issue of condoms for the Pope, internationally it was other things. This cartoon continues to move.
What was it like to deal with all this controversy?
This cartoon [of Pope John Paul II] was controversial because they wanted it to be that way. It turned out very well and didn't create any fuss. Then there was a conservative movement within the Church that wanted to make it a controversy, within three weeks they started hyping it up, creating a petition. The man who led the Catholic forces said he expected a million signatures, but, fortunately, he only got 29,000, and the difference meant that the mountain didn't even give birth to a mouse. It was even discussed in the Assembly [of the Republic]. It's a rather insignificant controversy, even more so, 30 years later, when the Church itself is changing its point of view on this matter, particularly with this Pope [Francis], fortunately. Given what led me to do this cartoon, I would do it again. The Pope's statements at the time were public, they were not even hidden, within walls, and he spoke to the whole world, therefore, also to me. I felt injured, that it didn't make any sense. I think the Pope's attitude, at that time, was criminal, at the height of AIDS and in Africa. It was enormously insensitive and foolish.
Is the cartoon a throwing weapon, a form of expression?
Throwing a weapon is too harsh an expression, but the cartoon is, in fact, the way I express myself. There are colleagues of mine who make articles, but I make drawings.
What other cartoons do you highlight for what they brought to you?
The first one that sensitized me was the one that made me win the world's largest salon in the world [major prize of the XX Salon International of Cartoon, Montreal, 1983], from this corner that is Portugal. A hall that had over a thousand participants, and gaining it was very good. I was safer, confident, because from then on they could continue to do things. This first cartoon also gave controversy, the “Warsaw Ghetto in Shatila”, in which I use the known photograph of the ghetto, a Jewish kid raised, harassed by Nazi soldiers, and in the cartoon the kid is Palestinian and Israeli soldiers. [The controversy was] with all the voices of the Jews, who are experts in this, making a lot of noise, with a certain tone of victimization, even if they are attacking. A hall director said he tried to change the vote, such is the weight of Jewish lobby, but failed.
This cartoon could be drawn today again.
I already published it again. Unfortunately it is not out of date.
But do you feel that much of what you designed about today is repeated, in a sign that the story is cyclical?
There is resistance to change. One of the cartoonist's merits is being able to see ahead of time, or at the top of time, if you like. I have the invasion of Crimea carried out in 2014, and I assume that vision. It was on top, and others did it later. There are other examples.
He began making cartoons after April 25, 1974, shortly after the Revolution. Do you feel that, in a way, you inaugurated the discipline of political cartooning in Portugal?
Perhaps. But I'm not very clear about that, because before me there was a great designer, João Abel Manta, a fantastic graphic artist, who had a huge difference in relation to us, as we were kids and he already had a culture that allowed him to that. But there is a less good side, as he did political propaganda. He was a man from the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), and he carried out this propaganda as far as the Revolution allowed. Then when things stabilized, he left and did other things. That doesn't take away from its quality, but it's not my idea of ​​a cartoon. I respond to the various stimuli of events in a different way. The cartoon allows me to express my opinions, but being able to do so from different directions of life, perspectives, without being a prisoner, as he was a prisoner of the PCP, was something that helped me a lot.
Did you ever feel any pressure from the newspapers where you collaborated?
(Hesitates). Some things, but they are not important. One thing I managed, without much effort, was to make people think that I had a really bad temper, and that it was better not to mess with me. This helped, because they thought twice before talking to me. Once at Expresso, a sports guy ordered a cover from me, and started giving me tips on how I should draw it. Until I asked him if I had ever told him how to write a news story. This must have remained in his memory for many years, and this conversation must have resonated with other people. I didn't go to Expresso, I was always in my corner and didn't get worn out by day-to-day life, with friendships and enmities.
Do you usually draw here, in the studio?
Here. But that [the ill-tempered image] actually helped me. And there is also the story of me having another profession. I usually say that I really had two professions, as I was a cartoonist and a graphic designer, and then I had clients of mine who were also from Expresso, namely A Tabaqueira. I was a friend of the commercial director, a self-indulgent type, who got me involved in negotiating contracts with the newspaper on behalf of A Tabaqueira. Therefore, I conveyed an effective image of power that, in reality, I did not have. If you combine a guy who has a bad temper with a guy who apparently has power, it's a bummer (laughs).
When I ask you about the pressures, I think in the period right after April 25, 1974-1975, when everything was politicized. Were there bigger?
I managed to deal with it. During this period of the Prec (ongoing revolutionary process) it even had a cartoon over the need that lasted two years. It was a kind of escape forward. There was a great confusion, and I think it was interested in my newspaper [express], although that was never said. It gave an idea of ​​freshness of the newspaper about a complex period, but they never told me that. I have the idea of ​​this use of Cartoon, it was the way of consolidating the newspaper's independence regarding events, even when sometimes there was no such independence.
Are we today in a politically correct era, where everything seems to offend?
I don't feel, because I don't want to feel. I came to a phase of my life where if they didn't want to put up with me, they don't work. It's easy. Everything that was a struggle to impose a name and a point of view, a career, has already been made. It can be improved and consolidated, but if not, it is not. If I become very inconvenient for the newspaper where I work, and I want to believe this does not happen…
But in general terms, regarding the news, comments on social media, do you feel there is political correctness?
Of course there is. My situation is exceptional. Younger people, in the world of cartoons, don't have any opportunities. They have less than when I started. Due to various accidents in life, I have a position that has solidified, but this is not an example of what is happening around me. The new cartoonists are full of problems, there is no space for them, there is no means of payment. They are pushed to get out of the newspapers, not into them.
Does the cartoon have no place on social media?
(Hesitates) It may appear, but it doesn't seem to me… they say that journalism is dying and we, cartoonists, go first. I think this is the trend. Journalism has been losing power in the face of social media, with anonymous opinion, which cannot be scrutinized, is very bad and mediocre. And this will grow.
What about Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Can replace the cartoonist.
I'm not even talking about this because I don't know the limits, but I understand that they must be terrible. It can indeed replace the cartoonist, but then creativity is subverted.
Are there any public figures that you particularly enjoy portraying in cartoons?
The other day I said that, in relation to Trump, I had two antagonistic feelings: as a citizen, I find the man detestable; but as a cartoonist it is my raw material. Putin is good too. All men with lots of narratives and lots of power are likely to give good things from the point of view of a cartoonist's analysis. They are politicians with a very clear speech about what they want and what they want, and that could be good for the cartoon.
How do you feel about going to Macau again?
The exhibition [at Clube Militar] will be different from the others, with 160 works. It's still a lot. It's a journey through these years, through Portuguese and international politics as well. I'm full of curiosity, promoting the exhibition, seeing what people ask me, but that's part of the game.
The Macau press does not have a large cartoon presence, with the exception of Rodrigo [Rodrigo de Matos].
I know him, I get along well with him. But I must say that the phenomenon is similar to Portugal. What do we have here? Me, at Expresso; Cristina Sampaio at Público; André Carrilho left Diário de Notícias; António Maia in Correio da Manhã and little else. This is a general trend. Sometimes, and I think this happened to me, there are moments when a cartoonist can represent an asset to the newspaper, but there are only a few moments when this can happen. In my most complicated period at Expresso, at the end of the 70s, a reference newspaper that, at the time, was in a country in turmoil, with some “irresponsibility” I was able to go ahead, and I have the perception that I helped the newspaper to untangle itself these limitations. But this happens in very specific periods. At that stage [after the 25th of April], I even made drawings at night that, by day, were already out of date.
Do you really have a bad temper or is it just a disguise?
I'm shy, but I'm taking care of myself. (laughs) It was never something that blocked me, I speak well in public. I'm a guy who doesn't like taking stupid risks. I've been in this building for several years and I only know the concierge because I have to, and I don't want to run the risk of having an unfriendly person who I've given trust to. I do this with the utmost naturalness.
Exhibition at the Military Club
After the lecture at Fundação Rui Cunha, this Wednesday, António will be at the University of São José today speaking to students at the “Cartoon Design: Creation of Ideas” workshop. This Friday follows the opening of the exhibition at Clube Militar, which will be on view until January 2nd.</description><pubDate>2024-12-12 00:58:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Gaming Analyst Ben Lee on New Concessions: “We Need Something Big”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/12/03/ben-lee-analista-de-jogo-sobre-as-novas-concessoes-precisamos-de-algo-grandioso/</link><description>Gaming analyst and consultant Ben Lee believes that much more needs to be done to diversify Macau's economy beyond gaming, especially taking into account the type of events organized under the new concessions. The analyst thinks Macau could look to two resorts in Vietnam as examples to follow to attract international tourists
 
What balance do you do the two years of new game concessions?
There is still a lot of work to do. From what we have seen so far, the concessionaires have focused on lighter projects, such as local art galleries, cultural events, holding concerts and small rehabilitations of cultural neighborhoods. The big projects, like the high-tech amusement park, the Conservatory or new hotels are yet to be seen. Since two of the ten years [of the concession] have already passed, and taking into account that the construction of some of these projects is expected to take several years, it seems that it will be necessary to postpone them. Revenues from the non-gaming segment, as a percentage of gross revenue earned by concessionaires, appear to be higher than in 2019, but have declined in the last two years. It is possible that they will return to between 10.5 and 11 percent in 2019 in the next two years.
Recently, Ho Iat Seng thanked the concessionaires for fulfilling the contracts and collaborating in the development of the non-gaming segment, reiterating that they managed to make some profits during the pandemic. Do you think your words were fair?
Casinos are making efforts to develop the non-game segment, but once again most of these efforts are focused on lower, lower-level events. We don't see great ideas like the $ 2.3 billion investment sphere we see in Las Vegas, for example. If that happened, it would easily fit the $ 15 billion commitments promised by the concessionaires [when signing the new contracts]. We could also talk about the idea of ​​making a Formula 1 competition on the street, as seen in Singapore and recently in Las Vegas.
How do you analyze the recovery of operators in terms of gaming revenue in recent months?
The recovery of gaming in Macau has been extremely good, with the sector expected to recover to around 78 or 79 percent of the levels recorded in 2019.
The Macao Game Society (SJM), for example, was one of the game operators with the greatest difficulty in terms of cash flow during the pandemic. Do you consider that your recovery, compared to the other five, was positive?
SJM struggled at first, but appears to be finally making some progress. But they will still face some challenges in repositioning their “hardware” [installations and other projects] in the future.
What can we expect from the new Sam Hou Fai Government in the gaming area?
The chief executive elected seems to be trying to ensure that operators honor their commitments. Your two terms will probably cover the next eight years of the new concessions. I think that, ultimately, everything will be known to know if he can motivate the various government appliances to perform his vision and mission.
As part of the new contracts, how do you see the global evolution of the gaming sector?
In 2019, the percentage of non-game segment revenues compared to the game's recipes reached 10.5 percent. This percentage rose to 22 percent during COVID-19, and has since gradually fallen to 13.5 percent, according to the third quarter of this year. This percentage will continue to decrease as game recipes continue to grow. In recent times we have seen residents of Macau and Hong Kong go to the north [China] to save money. The question that arises is why the inhabitants of the continent would go down and do the reverse? The solution, as provided by the authorities, is that Macau needs to diversify the market [of tourists and players] that comes from the continent. This makes perfect sense in terms of logic, but the reality is that our efforts seem to be regressing. Visitors from outside the Greater China represented 7.8 percent of the total visitors from Macao, but decreased to 6.5 percent by the end of September this year. This refers to the lightweight events that have been organized that, by far and largely, are really oriented to the Chinese who, after all, constitute most of our source of recipes.
How can you get around this scenario?
Returning to the beginning, I think we really need something large, iconic, similar to the sphere in Las Vegas or even something like the “Golden Bridge” project in Da Nang, worthy of appearing on Instagram, or “Bridge From the kiss ”, in Phu Quoc, both in Vietname. The fact that these projects were built by a local group linked to the hotel sector, without any connection to profits from the game, demonstrates long -term creativity and perspective in terms of planning.
Class struggle
Ben Lee warns of the danger of the mass market “fleeing” Macau
The conversation with Ben Lee comes in the context of a lecture that recently starred in the two years of new game concessions. Promoted by the France-Macau Chamber of Commerce, the session was named “Macau New Gaming Landscape: Two Years Into Concessions, What Now?”, Having Igamix Management &amp; Consulting, according to Asian Gaming Brief, according to the portal Gaming Brief (AgBrief), that the VIP game did not end completely, thus being the target of a new classification.
According to AGBrief, citing words from Ben Lee, “the mass game has incorporated the same echelon [of players] that was so openly criticized by the Government”, but that operators “are changing their focus to accommodate it”.
The analyst highlighted the "recent focus on the transformation of older and older hotel rooms into luxury options, with all operators understanding the need to get quality rather than quantity."
However, he argued that “the focus on the luxury segment continues to create an impasse”, as “Macau has long focused on increasing the number of visitors in order to increase revenue”, but the business model “goes against the need to increase expenses per person.”
Ben Lee also warned that many tourists may, in fact, start to opt for other destinations with more affordable prices. The analyst argued that mass players “cannot be ignored”, as they continue to be “the main driver” of the sector. “Exorbitant hotel room prices could be a ‘dam’ to the increase in visitors”, as, as he suggested, “gamblers may go to other holiday spots, such as Thailand, if the price is not good”. This Asian country “is growing and is expected to overtake Singapore in terms of gross revenue”, at a time when the Thais are working on new gambling legislation.
“They hope to pass your game law in May next year. Starting from the principle this happens three to five years to build an integrated resort or enterprise. They may be working considerably before the opening of Japan, ”said Ben Lee.
Still in relation to the gaming market in Asia, the analyst highlighted that Asian bettors will focus on the future gaming markets of Thailand and Japan “while taking advantage of current offers in Macau, Singapore and the Philippines”, wrote AGBrief.</description><pubDate>2024-12-03 00:08:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Miguel Gomes, director: “Cinema is not a court”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2024/11/29/miguel-gomes-realizador-o-cinema-nao-e-um-tribunal/</link><description>Molly and Edward have a wedding scheduled, but when it's time to pick up the bride from the train, Edward decides to run away, starting the “Grand Tour” through Asia. The film is one of Miguel Gomes' films shown at the Film Festival between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries, which is running until December 13th, the day on which “Grand Tour” is shown.
 
It is one of the directors in focus at this film festival that takes place in Macao. How do you feel the opportunity to show your latest movie, "Grand Tour" in this region?
Being able to show the film anywhere in the world is always a goal for someone who wants to make films, as they only exist from the moment they are seen. The film has a relationship with Asia and China. It was bought for Hong Kong, and I don't know if it will be shown commercially in the territory and what the distributors' plans are. Regardless of this festival in Macau, the film will have visibility in that part of China.
The film is a tribute to ancient cinema, at least that's how I faced him.
No. I think the cinema does not need to be honored, because the history of cinema is a heritage that we honor seeing it. It is very important that this memory will continue to be part of our lives and that movies can be shown. In Lisbon we are fortunate to have a very competent and strong cinemateca that fulfills this mission. Today's cinema is alive, although it does not have such a strong social role as it had in the twentieth century, and I don't think it needs honors. The Grand Tour is a movie today, but let's say it has the memory of other films that have been made. I do not intend to honor the cinema, but to explore the potential it has, doing two very different things.
What are they?
One of them will, in fact, have to do with the history of cinema and its historical heritage, which I link to studio work. This is something that cinema has done a lot, inventing worlds that are not our real world. On the other hand, I wanted to capture reality, as cinema also has the potential to place the camera in front of people, film events, places and be able to record this.
When I refer to this homage to old cinema I am referring to the presence of a certain way of filming that was once in vogue. Did you want to mix old and contemporary cinematic elements?
I wanted to work with the manufactured Asia, which never existed, that cinema created.
With the Western view of Asia.
The vision that Americans and Europeans created. A large part of American cinema was invented by Europeans, people like [Josef von] Sternberg, who came from Germany and was the greatest example of a film author who worked with an image of romanticized Asia.
And filmed in Macao, even. [The movie “Macao”, 1952]
Exactly. I wanted to work with this imaginary, trying to create a dialogue where we could go out of the studio and be in Asia that corresponded to colonial time in many of those countries, but then, at other times, we could be in a present time. This time would be the future of the characters, in another postcolonial historical time.
“Grand Tour” was the name given to the route that many Westerners took to discover a certain Asia. To make the film, I assume some historical research was necessary. What was this process like?
I wouldn't call it very in-depth research, because that wasn't the objective. [The “Grand Tour”] is not a sociological film, it is a cinematic fantasy. It's more on that side than on the sociopolitical side, so to speak. The starting point was two pages from a travel book [the story ‘Mabel’, by W. Somerset Maugham], which gave us this itinerary. The situation described [in the story] corresponds to what we see in the film, with an engaged couple, with him living in Burma and her returning from London. He panics and runs away on the day he is supposed to pick her up from the Yangon pier. The couple then goes on this itinerary, and in the book she manages to catch her fiancé and they get married, but in the film it is different.
I assume it is difficult to compare movies. But do you understand that the "Grand Tour" marks a turning into your career over previous productions?
I don't think so. It's a personal movie, like all those I had the opportunity to do. It is personal in the sense that limitations or any production notebook of the producer have not been imposed. I could do exactly what I wanted. I see common elements of this movie to others I made. I think it is part of my work. Then there was the question of receiving the film and the fact that he won a prize in Cannes [best director], which obviously helps me continue to work and have a more favorable receptivity right now.
It's a great recognition.
Before making this movie I was trying to do another in Brazil, an adaptation of Euclides da Cunha's book, “The Sertões”, and is a complicated project that involves a great production logistics. During the time he was trying to make the film it was difficult [to continue] for several reasons, and one of them is named Jair Bolsonaro [former president of the country]. Today we are resuming this process of returning to the movie. There was a height of discouragement, when I thought I really had to give up the project, and today the process of refinancing of the film is advancing much faster. The perspectives are more encouraging.
Do you feel that the award won in Cannes is also from Portuguese cinema?
I hope so. For my part, I have no doubt that what I do owe it to the efforts of other filmmakers who filmed before me, and some of them continue to do so. They had to confront the characteristics of our market and society, managed to shoot in a country where there is no industry because there is no market for it. They had to fight hard to be able to shoot and make the movies they made. I recognize an experience of identity in these films, I review myself, although the movies are all very different. There is, in fact, this identity in the history of Portuguese cinema, perhaps from the 1960s, with Cinema Novo, with producers and directors who fought hard to shoot. They made movies that, for me, are very important. Nowadays, with the system created with their fight, it is easier for me and my colleagues than it will have been in the 60s and 70s.
Political conditions were also different, with less investment.
Political conditions changed over time, but their lives were not easy either after April 25, 1974. The way in which Portuguese cinema managed to impose itself and gain space for it to exist was fought in historical times and interlocutors different. And it was difficult.
Let's go back to the "Grand Tour". He said in an interview that the movie's shooting was "Surrealist." What moments that highlight this phase?
When I said this I referred to a specific time of shooting in China, which was very surrealistic. This occurred thousands of kilometers, was in Lisbon because he could not enter the country because of COVID-19. After two years of waiting to be able to film, I decided that the only way to make the movie would be to have a Chinese team and me to be in Lisbon and shoot at a distance. He was in an Airbnb at Arairo, surrounded by monitors and discussing what should be filmed with the Chinese team. Then it was all very surrealistic, yes.
Have you ever been afraid of not being able to capture the essence of the place, of Asian culture, taking into account all these conditions?
I thought it wouldn't work. I suspect the technique a lot, I'm quite analog, and I thought it wasn't going to work. To result, it had to have the image live, give a "action" and a "cut" in real time, which could have the overall image, which was around the place beyond the image of the camera. I needed to have a communication system that worked with the photography director and the chamber official to be able to give him indications at the time we were filming. This was all possible, and I was amazed at it. On the other hand, the idea of ​​capturing the essence of the place, or a deeper thing of the culture of one of these countries, in this case in China, it seems to me too heavy. That was not my intention in the movie, because it is impossible. I believe a movie is always the result of a negotiation between someone who looks and what exists to look at. There is a subjective side. What interests us, which appeals to us, who dialogues with us and raises the desire to film can exist in China, Vietname, Africa or here on the coffee terrace where we are. I left for Asia as I left for the area of ​​Arganil to make a previous movie, "that dear month of August."
In a village.
Yes, a rural area of ​​Portugal, and I don't know if I would look at it differently in one situation or another. There is always something that I find beautiful or that touches me in different ways. What happens in “Grand Tour” is a series of disagreements, that of the couple, but it seems to me that there is also a disagreement between those European characters in their relationship with the territory. It seems that they are always disconnected from the space where they live. They live a bit in a bubble.
But colonialism was a bit of it too.
Yes. I agree, I think there are people who can see this in the film, this dissociation between what the characters are experiencing and what is happening around them. We often chose not to translate what was happening in front of them so that the Western viewer could be as intrigued and lost as the characters themselves. I also think that, nowadays, there is an idea, which I completely disagree with, that cinema exists to correct history and all the injustices in the world. It is also too heavy a task for cinema. It seems deeply inappropriate to me, because cinema is not a court to judge nor a space to punish spectators and characters, it is something else. Films don't have to be denunciations, prisoners of expectation. I tried to make a film where the colonial issue could be dealt with, but without having to punish either the spectators or the characters.
What was your relationship with Asia or your idea of ​​Orientalism?
I wanted to work on the idea that there was an invented and manufactured Asia by the European look, and I was aware that it existed and had to work with it in the movie. The world of fiction, on the other hand, has as one aspect this idea of ​​exoticism, regardless of the sociological issue, that there was a western look at the East, almost as a superficial view of this world. But fiction works with stereotypes, and that's not bad. It is the cement and then do anything with these stereotypes.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion. , expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death , systematically carried out to this day (still in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the county).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
The gentlemen we are talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, nor in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>After “very positive meeting”, Borges “looking forward to playing at a stadium” with Thompson</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/14/apos-encontro-muito-positivo-borges-ansioso-por-jogar-num-estadio-com-thompson/</link><description>Portuguese tennis player Nuno Borges made his debut yesterday, the 13th, in the 113th edition of the Australian Open, the first Major of the season, with a “very positive encounter” against Frenchman Alexandre Muller at Melbourne Park, where he will now face the Australian Jordan Thompson.
“I am very happy. It was a very positive meeting. I think, in general, I served very well, at least I managed to put the ball on the places where I wanted and have a good percentage (69%). I felt that I kept quite constant except in the tie-break of the first set, which I didn't play very well. I always kept looking for and very consistent during a meeting and this turned out to be the key to the result, ”he said in statements to Lusa.
The world's national and 33rd number one needed two hours and 55 minutes to get the best of the Gaul opponent, recently champion of the Hong Kong ATP 250, in four sets, by the 6-7 (2-7) partials (2-7). , 6-3, 6-2 and 7-5, but believes it has deserved the triumph, in the return to Melbourne, where a year ago became in the first Portuguese tennis player to reach the round of 16.
“I feel like I deserved to win in four sets, I was slightly higher from the first set and I'm very happy. The first rounds are never easy in terms of sensations. Tennis does not flow the same way, is trying to gain pace, but fortunately meetings at the best of five sets give more time to find this rhythm. I feel that I ended up the meeting quite well, although exhausting too, ”he explained.
After the inaugural round victory, Nuno Borges will “take the opportunity to rest and recover tomorrow to play possibly Wednesday” with a home player, Jordan Thompson (27th ATP), who today surpassed at Margaret Court Arena O 'Qualifier' German Dominik Koepfer also in four partials, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, 4-6 and 6-3.
“I hope it’s a good opportunity to play in a stadium possibly, I’m looking forward to it. We played a long time ago [Estoril Open 2021]. In 2024, he had a great season, quite impressive and I know that he, here in Australia, competes very well, always available to play five sets. I know that I will have to play my best tennis and I am waiting for another great challenge, perhaps even more challenging than today”, concluded Borges, winner of the only duel with Thompson.</description><pubDate>2025-01-14 16:15:44</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Luca Engstler is still recovering from the accident</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/12/gp-macau-luca-engstler-ainda-recupera-do-acidente/</link><description>Although every year the Macau Grand Prix Organizing Committee puts a lot of resources and a lot of energy in the driver's safety, the Guide Circuit Continates, and will continue to be one of the most dangerous and risky in the world. This year, the young German Luca Engstler, who first participated in a GT3 car, felt the old maxim of this circuit in the skin: “The mistakes pay dearly”
 
After eight weeks after the most severe accident of his career, the 24 -year -old is still recovering from the apparent misfortune at the Cup of GT World Cup of the 71st Macao Grand Prix. On Friday afternoon, with the chronometer counting and when trying to improve his brand, Luca Engstler lost control of his Lamborghini Huracán GT3 Evo in the dreaded Mandarin curve, beating over 230 km/h in protective barriers. The car inscribed by the Liqui Moly Team Engstler, but prepared and placed by Grasser Racing Team, was completely destroyed and the German pilot even became unconscious after the impact.
“This is a unique event, the Lamborghini's pace was not very good and to be ahead we had to take more risks than the others. Basically, I went completely for it and was unsuccessful”, explained Luca Engstler, at the time, about the accident he suffered. Two months after what was “the most horrible day of my life to date”, the former German Touring Champion (TCR) is still in the recovery process.
“It was really a big impact”, recalled Luca Engstler, in conversation with the specialized portal Motorsport-Total.com, who needed a wheelchair after the accident. “The big problem was that my right ankle suffered a lot. I tore my lateral ligaments and had a lot of hemorrhages in my tibia and fibula, which caused some concern,” he recalled.
Returning to walking normally was also a great challenge for the young Lamborghini driver, who in the 2024 season impressively won two DTM races and participated for the first time in a GT3 car in Macau. “It took me a long time to be able to walk,” he recalled. “For the first two or three days, I was actually in a wheelchair, because I simply couldn’t do anything and all my bones hurt,” Engstler described to his country’s publication, noting that “I had bruises everywhere and everything was difficult ”.
Recover
Even so, Lucas Engstler, at the end of the day of the accident, already at the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário, made a post on social media stating that everything was fine. The driver, who was in Macau accompanied by his father, Franz Engstler — also a driver and a well-known figure in Asian motorsport — wanted to reassure those closest to him. Two days after the accident, he appeared on the starting grid of the FIA ​​GT World Cup on Sunday, without crutches, only slightly supported by an umbrella.
“What was important to me was not wanting to make a big deal about it,” he explained to the German portal. “In the end, the accident seemed very serious, but that just shows how safe the cars are,” he highlighted.
The pilot continues to recover from the after-effects of the strong impact. He took advantage of the winter break to take a motorhome trip to Sweden with his best friend. “Everything is going well”, he stated, clarifying that he is now able to run. “I’d say I’m at 95 percent and have no permanent damage.”
After the accident, the German worked on his recovery in the Allgäu region, in his homeland, “with some acquaintances, who are physiotherapists and doctors. I received excellent assistance.”
Return
Luca Engstler admits that she has become impatient during the recovery process. "I was told that I could only do sports again in early February, but of course this could not accept," recognizing that he started training earlier than recommended.
Fortunately for Luca Engstler, the DTM only starts on the last weekend of April. In the near future, the driver plans to get behind the wheel again, possibly in a rental kart to begin with. The aim is to be in shape for the start of pre-season and preparation tests for the popular German championship, scheduled for mid-February and early March.
As for the Macao Grand Prix, two days after the accident, Luca Engstler was quite clear: “I told everyone that my goal is to return and try to fight for victory in this great race.”</description><pubDate>2025-01-12 23:43:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorsport | Rui Valente does not give up</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/automobilismo-rui-valente-nao-se-da-por-vencido/</link><description>Rui Valente will return this year for another season in motorsport in the region. The Macao driver has been in the active for the same time and will play the Macau Roadsport Challenge, the tourist car competition organized by the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), as well as the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix , in November
 
With the same enthusiasm that has been recognized for decades, Rui Valente will again drive, in the 2025 season, a Subaru BRZ, the same car he competed in at the Guia Circuit, last November, in the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. In the race held at the territory's event, the Portuguese driver finished in sixth place, after losing some positions at the start, where he dropped to tenth. The result was not even better because the race, held in the rain, ended prematurely due to an accident by an opponent.
In the competition for local pilots, which currently combines starting grids with more than half a hundred cars, all of them Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8), Rui Valente admitted to HM that “not being overcome”, revealing still who is “missing the podium, both in China and Macau…”.
Premium Racing Team driver had, in the last Macao Grand Prix, one of the fastest in terms of tip speed in the platoon of his race. Therefore, the bet for this year will be in other technical aspects of the car that go beyond the engine.
"At this time, I just wanted to increase the diameter of the front wheels and widen the gauge to improve the car's behavior," he confided to HM, also reporting that he intends to "optimize weight transmission during the curve and its. exit". These improvements, along with lock system updates, should increase the competitiveness of the Japanese machine in a fierce grid, consisting of Macau, Hong Kong pilots and China interior, with constantly evolving cars.
Undefined calendar
The AAMC -organized car competition calendar has not yet been revealed. In 2024, Macau Roadsport Challenge debuted at the Zhuzhou International Circuit in East of Hunan Province, but Rui Valente would rather the competition to return to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC) this year in Zhaoqing.
“I was very fond of returning to Gic, because I have everything there,” says the Portuguese pilot, defender of the track located in the neighboring province. “When you go to a qualification test, for those who make four races and then Macau, if you are on a track you already know, such as GIC, where you are seven or more years, each time you get on the track and try to do better than which last means you are improving and improving your driving. So you know you soon that you are stronger that year to Macau. ”
On the other hand, for the experienced driver from the territory, “if you go to a new track, like the Zhuzhou circuit, in addition to going there to learn the new route and improve your time, you will never know if you are really stronger to Macau, as you know when you race in the GIC.”
Like what happened in past seasons, the Macau Roadsport Challenge calendar is expected to be composed of two weekends, with two races each, which also serve as an investigation for the Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:47:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Tennis | Nuno Borges will play against Alcaraz at the Australian Open</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/16/tenis-nuno-borges-vai-jogar-frente-a-alcaraz-no-open-da-australia/</link><description>Nuno Borges overcame his nervousness on Wednesday to defeat Australian Jordan Thompson, in three sets, in the second round of the Australian Open, and will now face 'Carlitos' Alcaraz without pressure, the Portuguese tennis player admitted to the Lusa agency.
“I feel like it was a good game on my part. Without a doubt, it was better than the first round, the sensations were there”, he began by analyzing the national number one, speaking to the Lusa agency, after advancing to the third round of the first Grand Slam of the season.
The 27-year-old Maiato contradicted Wednesday the favoritism of the 'local' Jordan Thompson, 27th standard head, imposed on 6-3, 6-2 and 6-4 partials, in one hour and 47 minutes, in a John Cain Arena - the third most important court by Melbourne Park - crowded.
"It was very nervous, it was a big stadium, not every day [that happens], so I think within that I could make a very good game and I really am very happy for the result," he said.
Head to Alcaraz
Semifinalist in Auckland at the start of the year, Borges has now extended his good moment, setting a meeting in the third round with Spanish Carlos Alcaraz, the third world player.
“Now, against 'Carlitos', there is not much to say. Everyone knows what he is capable of and everything he has done, [is] quite famous around the world, there is not much to highlight, ”he said about his opponent who, in Australia, seeks to become the younger Tennis player (is 21 years old) to complete the career Grand Slam.
In front of Spanish, the 33rd ATP ranking will try to do its best and "make it the most uncomfortable possible." "I will play without pressure, try not to put high expectations in my head to see if I can bring my best tennis," he concluded.
Last year, Nuno Borges, who will still start his walk in the pairs alongside Francisco Cabral, became the first Portuguese tennis player to reach the round of 16 at the Australia Open.</description><pubDate>2025-01-16 22:38:03</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Maro Engel clarified GT World Cup episode</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/10/gp-macau-maro-engel-esclareceu-episodio-da-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>Maro Engel won, in a race not suitable for those with heart failure, the FIA ​​GT World Cup at the 71st Macau Grand Prix. However, the German's fourth victory among us was anything but peaceful. Maro Engel took advantage of an interview with the German magazine Motorsport Aktuell to explain what happened on the streets of the territory and which earned him so much criticism
 
The German driver, who will turn 40 years old this year, had a 2024 season full of success: he won the GT World Challenge Europe, was the best of the Mercedes-AMG representatives in the DTM and achieved a fourth triumph in the Grand Prix of Macao. However, Maro Engel prefers not to highlight a single achievement in his dream 2024 season, having told his country's specialized magazine that “in terms of prestige, the victory in Macau has to be highlighted. But honestly, I don't want to highlight a single moment as the greatest achievement of this incredible year. I worked hard to achieve all these successes.”
In the since, the triumph of the Bavarian pilot was offered on a tray when the first two ranked ranks, Antonio Foco (Ferrari) and Raffaele Marciello (BMW), fell out in the lock for the Lisbon curve two turns from the end. However, Maro Engel had already been involved in another incident, when, at the beginning of the race, his loneliness, his Mercedes-AMG GT3 gave a subtle touch to the back of the Dryi Vanthoor BMW, which followed in front of him in the third position. The young Belgian was projected against the barriers, eventually abandoning due to damage to the suspension of the M4 GT3, while Maro Engel would see the flag axad said first, with an advantage of 11 seconds.
Already at the end of the race, the Sports Commissioner College decided that the touch of the aforementioned tap deserved a 5 -second penalty, which had no impact on the final result, leading BMW Motorsport, Andreas Roos to tell the press that the incident “ It was not adequately penalized. ” Dries Vanthoor, who was also a candidate for victory, went further and said at the time that when “pushing another car out of track, he should not be able to win the race.”

It was not on purpose
Maro Engel's aggressive style was criticized at the time, but the pilot, who debuted to win in Macau in 2014, prefers to point out that “does everything within the boundaries of Fair Play” and thinks it is “hard to accuse a pilot not to try everything to win there (in Macau). ” In the situation in question, Maro Engel wanted to clarify that “I was clearly faster. At the wide part of the circuit at the bottom, I had no chance of attacking, so I tried at the top. It ended up running badly, and that was not my intention. I apologized to the dries later. In general, I run to win. The day you no longer give it all for that, I hang my helmet. I definitely not here to make new friends. ”
Despite the “chair dance” among the car builders involved in the GT3 class in this preseason, Maro Engel will continue to defend the colors of Mercedes-AMG, something that has been doing since 2008, and of course will be one of the stupid brand choices to The World Cup in November, at the Guide Circuit. The natural pilot of Munich is not being removed from the tracks anytime soon, because “I have not reached my peak yet and I still find pleasure in the races.”
In his curriculum, in events held in Macau, Maro Engel has two wins in the GT Macau Cup - FIA GT World Cup (2015 and 2024) and two in the GT Macau Cup (2014 and 2022), but promises not to stay here.</description><pubDate>2025-01-10 06:21:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Football | Guangzhou FC dissolved due to excessive debt</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/08/futebol-guangzhou-fc-dissolvido-por-excesso-de-endividamento/</link><description>Guangzhou FC, the football club with the most titles in China, was dissolved yesterday due to excessive debt, suffering the same fate as dozens of clubs in the country, after years of exuberance.
Formerly known as Guangzhou Evergrande, the club was unable to meet the Chinese Football Association's financial requirements needed to compete in the 2025 season.
“Due to the heavy financial burden resulting from previous seasons, the club was unable to pay all debts within the deadline,” Guangzhou said in a statement. “We express our sincere apologies and thank all fans for their understanding and forgiveness,” he added.
After being acquired by Real Evergrande Real Estate in 2010, the club started a wave of spending in China that made headlines around the world.
Helped by players such as Brazilian international Paulinho and elite coaches such as Italian Marcello Lippi and former Portuguese team coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, Guangzhou won eight titles from the Chinese Superleague, a maximum football race in China between 2011 and 2019. Team also triumphed in the Asia Champions League in 2013 and 2015.
However, in 2021, Evergrande recorded debts of more than 300 billion dollars and, as key players left the club due to financial problems, it was relegated to China's second tier in 2022.</description><pubDate>2025-01-08 02:01:40</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
