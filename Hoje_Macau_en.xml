“As China's economic model loses steam, African leaders will have to plan growth and economic transformation aware that their largest trading and investment partner could have a very different profile than it has had until now”, reads the analysis carried out by the group, based in New York.
Angola is identified as one of the countries most sensitive to the evolution of the second largest economy in the world. China is one of the main destinations for Angolan crude and the report anticipates that Chinese imports of African oil are expected to stagnate or decline, as Beijing accelerates the energy transition, expands the fleet of electric vehicles and reduces the energy intensity of its economy.
This scenario could put pressure on tax revenues, exports and Luanda's ability to honor its external debt, in a context in which the country already pays more to China in repayments than it receives in new loans.
Mozambique may have a different trajectory. Although also exposed to Chinese demand for raw materials, the report anticipates a structurally robust demand for strategic minerals associated with the energy transition, such as graphite and other critical minerals, sectors in which Mozambique has been gaining relevance.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:58:15</pubDate></item><item><title>DSAMA | Authorities prepare for dry period</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/dsama-autoridades-preparam-se-para-periodo-seco/</link><description>Local and Zhuhai authorities met on the 19th to discuss preventive water storage to combat saline intrusion, which will lead to a dry period until February. The meeting was held between the Bureau of Maritime and Water Affairs (DSAMA), the Zhuhai Water Affairs Bureau and Zhuhai Water Environment Holdings Group LTD.
Taking into account the forecasts of water authorities in Mainland China, “the natural inflow to the Xi River basin is expected to be between 10 and 30 percent below the average between December 2025 and February 2026, indicating drier conditions than usual this winter and next spring”, is mentioned in the DSAMA statement.
Taking this scenario into account, it was indicated that, currently, “effective storage capacity has reached 90 percent, exceeding the levels observed in the same period of previous years”, and “all reservoirs in Zhuhai are operating with high water levels”, with their maintenance completed before the arrival of this “dry period”.
Susana Wong, director of DSAMA, said that “over the years, the Zhuhai Water Affairs Department has continuously strengthened its capacity to guarantee the supply of raw water to Macau”.
The official also said, regarding the emergency water supply capacity in Macau, that “the project to expand the Seac Pai Van Reservoir is ongoing and its completion is scheduled for 2028”, and “after completion, Macau's water consumption autonomy will increase to 12 days”.
The meeting also served to discuss the price of raw water for the years 2026 to 2028, taking into account that “the Guangdong-Macao Water Supply Agreement provides for a three-yearly adjustment of the price of raw water supplied by Zhuhai to Macau, with 2026 being the next year of adjustment”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:24:43</pubDate></item><item><title>L’Arc | SJM obtains authorization for direct exploration</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/larc-sjm-obtem-autorizacao-para-exploracao-directa/</link><description>The concessionaire, SJM Resorts, obtained authorization to operate the Casino L’Arc Macau, under the form of direct management and exploitation, from 2am on December 30th.

The actress had been admitted to the hospital in the city of Toulon, in the south of France, since November.
In a statement, the Brigitte Bardot Foundation announced her death with “immense sadness”, describing her as a “world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation”.
Known for her enormous impact on cinema in the 1950s, «BB», as she was widely called in France, was an essential ingredient of French culture and quickly became an icon after her first role in Le Trou Normand (1952). Two more films followed in 1952, when she married director Roger Vadim. A year later, Bardot conquered Hollywood and the United States, and her popularity as one of the sexiest women in the world was firmly established.
Brigitte Bardot continued to act in a total of 28 films over two decades and became a symbol of women's sexual liberation. However, ruthlessly “marketed” as a sexual and hedonistic symbol, Bardot ended up succumbing to the frustration of not being taken seriously as an actress and abandoned her career to dedicate herself to campaigns for animal welfare.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:46:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Analysts highlight challenges in Macau’s economic growth</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/analistas-realcam-desafios-no-crescimento-economico-de-macau/</link><description>Experts contacted by the Lusa agency foresee challenges in the growth of Macau's economy for 2026, with the recovery of the gaming sector contrasting with weak domestic consumption and pressure for diversification.
Economist Henry Chun Kwok Lei, professor of Business Economics at the University of Macau and vice-president of the Macau Economic Association, maintains a “cautiously optimistic” outlook for 2026, predicting Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of around 2.5 percent during the next financial year.
“The high base of gross gaming revenue this year, projected between 246 and 248 billion patacas, will condition the growth potential in 2026. Even if casino revenue increases by around 4 percent, to more than 250 billion patacas, its contribution to global economic growth will decrease,” Henry Lei told Lusa.
Ben Lee, a consultant for gaming activity in Southeast Asia, has a more positive outlook. “Gross gaming revenue has already reached 226.5 billion patacas by November this year, so it is more than likely that we will exceed the projection of 228 billion,” he said.
The estimate for game revenue for 2026, the analyst added, is “a little conservative”. “Unless we go back next year, based on the current situation, gross revenues could reach a value between 260 and 270 billion patacas by the end of 2026”, he estimated.
Alarms sounded
The forecast included in the Budget for 2025 pointed to total revenues of around 240 billion patacas, but the weak start of the year, especially after the tariff war triggered by the USA, raised alarms among the economic team of Sam Hou Fai's Executive, which approved in June an Amending Budget in which it cut 4.56 billion patacas in the revenue forecast, highly dependent on the gaming sector (around 83 percent of Macau's GDP).
The Macau Economic Association predicts that annual GDP growth in 2025 will be around 5.4 percent, an estimate based on the “stable and positive trend of the main indicators of economic development, the globally stable functioning of the budgetary and financial systems and the maintenance of low unemployment rates”.
As for next year, adds the association, “the Macau economy is expected to maintain a stable and positive trajectory”, although the global panorama “continues to be characterized by interconnected turbulence and complexity”. The Government Budget for 2026 points to a 3.5 percent increase in Macau casino revenues next year, reaching 236 billion patacas, still the highest value since the pandemic.
Other critical challenges that Macau faces in 2026 are stimulating local consumption and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Speaking to Lusa, Lei Choek Kuan, president of the Federation of Industry and Commerce of Macau, pointed to the “irreversible” change in consumption patterns underway and highlighted the importance of government support for companies to maintain confidence.
Economist Henry Lei advocates a deeper structural transformation that goes beyond subsidies and suggested that local SMEs should look for differentiation and premium services — such as “improving after-sales service, developing creative cultural products and creating high-end culinary experiences” — to serve a niche demographic with high purchasing power, rather than competing on price with Mainland China.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 02:03:33</pubDate></item><item><title>CPSP | Officer drives drunk, has accident and flees the scene</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/cpsp-agente-conduz-bebedo-tem-acidente-e-foge-do-local/</link><description>The 31-year-old police officer tested the balloon and found 1.88 grams of alcohol per liter of blood. In addition to criminal liability, the CPSP initiated disciplinary proceedings against the agent
An officer from the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) is being subject to disciplinary proceedings for driving drunk, crashing his vehicle into a flowerbed and fleeing the scene. The incident happened in the early hours of December 24, when the 31-year-old man was off duty, and is therefore being investigated for the crimes of driving while drunk and evading responsibility.
According to authorities, the case was detected in the early hours of December 24, when the police were called to the intersection between Rua da Barca and Rua de João de Araújo, after a vehicle crashed into a flower bed. The result was a scene of destruction that did not miss metal posts and a flowerbed.
After identifying the vehicle involved in the accident, authorities approached the off-duty officer, who appeared to have a strong smell of alcohol. Suspicions that were confirmed by the balloon test, which showed a result of 1.88 grams of alcohol per liter of blood.
Furthermore, the detainee's vehicle had been parked illegally. The case was forwarded to the Public Prosecutor's Office, and the agent is charged with the crimes of driving while intoxicated, which carries a sentence of up to 1 year in prison, and evading responsibility, which carries a prison sentence of up to 1 year.
Alarm ringing
The fact that the suspect was a CPSP agent meant that the accident merited a police reaction, via the security department's website. “The CPSP deeply regrets the case of drunk driving by a police officer, reiterating that it has always given great importance to the disciplinary behavior of its personnel” was published.
The CPSP also guaranteed that the acts of agents “that violate the law and discipline are treated severely and in accordance with the law”. In addition to criminal liability, the CPSP opened a disciplinary investigation on the same day “to implement disciplinary liability in accordance with the law”.
In response to the incident, it is stated on the Secretary for Security's portal that “all departments received immediate instructions to continuously reinforce the awareness and education of their subordinate officers, reminding officers that their personal conduct is linked to the positive image of the police force”. It was also highlighted that even when officers are “off duty” they must “maintain the highest standards of self-discipline and comply with laws and regulations”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:39:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Tai Fung Bank | Fitch reduces financial viability rating</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/banco-tai-fung-fitch-reduz-rating-de-viabilidade-financeira/</link><description>The performance of loans linked to the real estate market in Mainland China is highlighted by the rating agency as the main factor for reducing the rating to the “bb” level. The assessment on the debt issuance was maintained at “BBB+”
The financial rating agency Fitch reduced Banco Tai Fung's financial viability rating from “bb+” to “bb”, warning of the possible impact of unexpected events on the institution's survival. The change was announced last week and justified by the impact of loans to the Mainland China real estate market on the bank's financial performance.
The “bb” level is the fifth highest on the 10-level financial viability rating scale, but indicates the existence of “high vulnerability” in the bank’s viability, if there are “unexpected changes in long-term commercial or economic conditions”.
The change in the financial viability rating comes despite Fitch recognizing that there are “moderate” expectations of the bank's continued viability and “strong financial strength”, linked to the fact that Banco Tai Fung is owned by the Bank of China.
However, loans linked to the property market in Mainland China are a concern. Fitch indicates that at the end of the first half of this year, loans represented 22 percent of the bank's total assets, an exposure considered “above the banking system average of 15 percent”. “We predict that the real estate market will take time to recover, prolonging the bank’s financial recovery”, indicated the agency.
In negative terms, Fitch also highlights the lower quality of the bank's assets, because the rate of non-performing loans remains “too high”, at 15.8 percent of the total of these loans.
The default rate is also highlighted as a factor in the significant reduction of the bank's profits, not only due to the loans that remain unpaid, but also because the market will have a lower demand for loans, which has been one of the supports of the institution's commercial model.
Support from above
Despite the challenges, the bank has in its favor the fact that it is owned by the Bank of China, which analysts believe is ready to inject money into Tai Fung. The connection with the Bank of China means that the assessment on the debt issuance is maintained at “BBB+”, the fourth highest level of the 11 that constitute the rating.
The Chinese state bank has a higher rating than Tai Fung in terms of debt issuance rating. Given this difference, Fitch admits an upward revision of Tai Fung's level, if there are signs that the Bank of China is ready to inject capital into the institution founded by Ho Yin.
In terms of Tai Fung's operating environment, Fitch highlights that it is the fourth largest bank in Macau, measured by loan value, where gaming is expected to continue to drive economic growth.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:29:24</pubDate></item><item><title>IAM | Resident seeks compensation due to fall on bike path</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/iam-residente-pede-indemnizacao-devido-a-queda-em-ciclovia/</link><description>After suffering injuries due to a fall on the Flor de Lótus Cycle Path, and still holding his arm across his chest, a resident asked for explanations during a session of the Board of Directors of the Institute for Municipal Affairs open to the public
A local resident who suffered a fall on the Flor de Lótus Cycle Path, in Taipa, is demanding compensation from the Government, due to the existence of a hole the size of two thirds of the road. The case, reported by the newspaper Cheng Pou, happened when the resident attended the open-to-public session of the Board of Directors of the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) to ask for explanations.
According to the report, the citizen presented himself with an arm across his chest and stated that he had suffered several injuries on October 31, after a fall while traveling on the Flor de Lótus Cycle Path. The accident was caused by a hole that the victim claims occupied at least two-thirds of the width of the cycle path.
The man suffered several bruises, dislocated a shoulder and also suffered a fractured collarbone, injuries that required him to be admitted to hospital for seven days. The resident is not satisfied with what happened and considers that there was negligence in the treatment of the cycle path by the authorities, and on November 13th he filed a claim for compensation.
Furthermore, the victim attended the December meeting of the Board of Directors of the Institute for Municipal Affairs, where he made an intervention questioning the nature of the inspections. The man questioned how the IAM can claim that it carries out periodic inspections of cycle paths, at the same time that it allows the existence of such a large hole. The victim also questioned whether the hole was due to the use of inferior quality materials.
The resident also pointed out that the hole was filled a month after the accident and questioned the IAM whether it only deals with infrastructure problems after there have been accidents and injuries.
To follow
In turn, the president of the Institute for Municipal Affairs, Chao Wai Ieng, began by wishing the resident who fell from his bicycle a speedy recovery. Regarding the questions raised, Chao Wai Ieng assured that the IAM always strives to “guarantee the suitability and safety of citizens” in the use of all public facilities. The IAM president also stated that the infrastructures are subject to regular inspections, both by the companies carrying out the works and by IAM workers.
At the same time, the guarantee was made that infrastructures with more intense use, such as cycle paths, are subject to frequent and continuous maintenance.
During the open session, the resident revealed that IAM is being represented by a Hong Kong office in the process relating to the compensation claim. This aspect surprised the resident, who admitted to having hung up the phone to the IAM's legal representative, during the first telephone contact, because he thought he was facing an attempted fraud.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:26:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Great Bay | Medicine internship plan with 25 places for residents</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/grande-baia-plano-de-estagios-de-medicina-com-25-vagas-para-residentes/</link><description>Applications are open until January 5th for the “Internship Plan for Young Doctors of Macau in the Greater Bay Area”, which will include training in traditional Chinese medicine and dentistry.

In January, the film schedule will include Pedro Almodóvar's latest film, “The Room Next Door” and the new film by local director Tracy Choi
In a dystopian scenario that, deep down, is not so different from what we live in today, there are people like Perfidia Beverly Hills, a revolutionary woman who seeks a fairer life for everyone. Perfidia maintains a relationship with another revolutionary, Bob Anderson, with whom she has a daughter, until one day everything goes wrong and Perfidia is forced to hide from everything and everyone, leaving her daughter with her father. In between, there is a soldier who will dedicate his life to persecuting this man and his daughter.
Here is the synopsis of the film “Battle After Battle”, by Paul Thomas Anderson, which in almost three hours not only tells a story but also analyzes the current times in which we live, addressing topics such as immigration, social justice, racial struggles and the utopia of a better world. It is with this film that Cinemateca Paixão closes the year 2025, with a single screening on Wednesday the 31st, starting at 7:30 pm, just in time to leave the cinema and go celebrate the arrival of 2026.
But the last days of the year also hold another cinematographic “cartridge”, with the screening of “Die My Love”, shown tomorrow, starting at 7:30 pm. The first day of the year brings “Flow – À Deriva”, which won the Oscar for Best Animated Film and which tells the story of a kitten who fights for survival in a world that is changing rapidly.
On January 1st you can also see “A Useful Ghost”, the first feature film by Thai director Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke, which caused a sensation at the Cannes Film Festival, winning the Critics' Week Grand Prize. This film will be shown again on the 4th, 10th and 14th of January.
Almodóvar in English
Cinemateca Paixão's program for January, entitled “Encantos de Janeiro”, also features the most recent film by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar, and also his first film in English. “The Room Next Door” stars Julianne Moore and Tilda Swinton in the main roles and is a film that celebrates themes such as friendship, the meaning of life and euthanasia. The story begins when one of the women, upon learning that she suffers from a terminal illness, decides to take refuge in a house and ask a longtime friend to take care of her until the inevitable end. The public also has a session available on January 10th.
On January 3rd, Cinemateca Paixão shows the documentary “Four Trails”, by director Robin Lee, which is a celebration of the nature that Hong Kong has in addition to the hustle and bustle of the city. This is the true story of Andre Blumberg, who in 2012 set himself the challenge of doing Hong Kong's four long-distance trails in just 72 hours, which translates into 298 kilometers. It is one of the most difficult marathons in the world, called the Hong Kong Four Trails Ultra Challenge.
Tracy Choi's new
Another major highlight of Cinemateca Paixão for the first days of the new year is the possibility of seeing the new film by local director Tracy Choi. “Girlfriends” will be shown on the 6th and 24th of January, after the film had its world premiere at the Busan International Film Festival, as part of the “Vision Asia” section. Elizabeth Tang, the film's actress, was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress award at the 62nd Golden Horse Awards, Taiwan's film awards.

According to the state agency Xinhua, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (APN, legislative body) gave the 'green light' to the new version of the standard, which will come into force on March 1, 2026, after a vote held this Saturday. The revised law incorporates a series of reforms, which until now were applied through regulations or sectoral policies.
These include the system of negative lists for cross-border trade in services, support for new formats and models of external trade, the push for digital trade and the acceleration of the construction of a “green” trade system. The text also establishes provisions for the State to advance in alignment with “high-level international economic and commercial standards” and participate in the formulation of global rules in this field, according to Xinhua.
With the aim of optimizing the environment for foreign trade, the law also reinforces the protection of intellectual property rights linked to international commercial activities. In this sense, it stipulates that the State will improve the level of regulatory compliance of foreign trade operators and their ability to manage risks related to intellectual property.
The standard also introduces a commercial adjustment assistance system, aimed at “stabilizing industrial and supply chains”, an aspect that has gained relevance in recent years in the face of commercial and technological frictions with the United States and other partners.
In time of truce
One of the highlights of the review is the expansion and improvement of the so-called “set of legal tools” for the defense of China's external interests, at a time marked by the trade truce reached with the United States and the persistence of tensions with other actors, such as the European Union.
The reform is approved weeks after Beijing and Washington agreed to a one-year trade truce, which includes tariff reductions and the temporary suspension of some restrictions, although Chinese authorities have insisted, in parallel, on the need to protect national economic security.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:54:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Real Estate | Drop in birth rate linked to crisis</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/imobiliario-quebra-da-natalidade-ligada-a-crise/</link><description>The president of Centaline Property Agency, Shih Wing-ching, considers that the drop in the birth rate is one of the factors that is contributing to the reduction in the value of real estate. The position was taken in an interview with am730 station, cited by Macau News Agency.
According to Shih, in the last five years the price of housing in Macau has decreased by 40 percent, largely driven by the birth rate, currently 0.68 children per woman. Therefore, he appealed to the authorities to ease immigration policies, so that the price recovers again. "The continued decline has depleted residents' confidence. Even buyers are hesitant to enter the market, fearing losses in asset values," he said.
The official also admitted that the Government is not exactly concerned, despite the buyers' losses: “They thought that lower house prices were not necessarily a bad thing, and that young people could thus enter the real estate market — a situation that could help with social stability, with fewer complaints”, he added.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:32:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Paulo Maia and Carmo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Li Liufang (1575-1629), the painter and poet who lived for a time in retirement in his Sandalwood Garden, near the West Lake, valued affection between friends, extending to those who lived far away and even those who no longer lived but left impressive traces of their affectionate relationship with the world.

Geniuses, the ancient Greeks knew about the Earth's sphericity and that's why they attributed a maximum circle to the planet, which they named Ison. Today we call it Ecuador. However, these Hellene geographers considered these regions to be unreachable and uninhabitable.
Torrid Zone: there, unbearable heat would boil the oceans, preventing the passage to temperate zones, postulated further south of this line that marked the maximum circle of the sphere.
A simple islet, named “das Rolas”, a mere hundred meters from the island of São Tomé, in the Gulf of Guinea, is crossed by this equatorial line. This location of the former Portuguese colony provides it with a type of climate that is only found with such intensity close to the equator: the temperature varies little and, contrary to what the Greeks thought, it does not reach excessive values. Its range is between 20 and 29 degrees Celsius, but the “normal” temperature remains between 23 and 25 degrees. Night, day and throughout the year.
In the permanently cloudy sky, the Sun and Moon are rarely seen. And when this happens, they never fail to appear wrapped in veils of clouds, which gives them an unreal character, invoking ancient magic, witnessing moving skies.
When, towards the end of the afternoon, the rain extends its reign for more than two or three hours, often presented to plants and animals by a thunderstorm, the light dies and a very dark night reigns over the land and sea. The stars fall beyond the clouds that cover everything. On a night like this, there is no moonlight to illuminate or pierce the clouds. A deep pitch falls on the earth, a darkness that is impenetrable to our eyes. And it was like that, at three in the morning, that I woke up. My eyes opened to an abysmal darkness. Nothing, absolutely nothing could be seen. He knew he had the window open, but not a ray of light deigned to enter the room. I reached out, but the lamp didn't work. The electricity was out again. I waited for some time, hoping to get used to the blackness and discover some shapes in it. In vain. He was immersed in a well of black, warm water, he could feel the humidity on his skin, which had just woken up sweaty from a nightmare. I decided to get up and leave the house, looking for some light.
The rain had stopped. Outside, the forest celebrated, hummed, reverberated with sounds. There would be millions of insects, amphibians, vertebrates, all of them nocturnal animals, also immersed in the dark, where they found food, sex and salvation. Life didn't need light. It was heard, deafening.
At the edge of that spontaneous excess of trees and plants, nothing could be seen either. Dark, impenetrable dark. Only the sound prevailed, louder and louder, and suggested movements among the trees. That mixture of buzzing, squealing, buzzing, ringing, rales, loudly surrounded my ears, building a helmet that blocked all other senses, including the one that affects me in space. I was dizzy. And in that half-daziness, I groped my way back to the house, to my bed.
There was nothing he could do. Forget the coffee, eliminate the possibility of reading or consulting a computer. Lying in the dark as if waking up in a coffin.
Our mind cannot handle fear for long. Mostly irrational. As was the case. I can't really talk about fear, fear, but about discomfort, derived from the fragile situation that I attributed to myself. Everything could happen in that dark, and I wouldn't see him. If for some reason you had to leave the room, where would you go, if everything was plunged into darkness? But nothing was happening in the darkness of my room, nor would anything happen that would force me to grope through the pitch black, looking for a light. On the contrary, in that bed I was protected by the dark and if I saw nothing nothing would see me either. This thought provided some comfort. All things considered, that abysmal pitch was strangely comfortable for me. I made it a protective cloak and not a space of threats. And so I remained.
The ancient Chinese say that everyone has an excellent place to stay. A place where you can develop and enjoy who you really are. Maybe this dark package is mine. Perhaps in it I can be for myself what I really am, setting aside what surrounds me, instructs and distracts me. I am undoubtedly alone. Without the possibility of communicating with another person or even acting in my surroundings. I'm left. With me. Alone. Isolated. Here I am not the anthropologist, nor the editor, none of my social titles perform any functions. I am not the husband, the friend or the lover. From the outside I only have the language that inhabits me and my brain rebels in search of meaning. And even this takes second place in daydreams whose material seems to emerge from another place, from knowledge not conditioned to a language — an impression of the world and not its explanation.
I am a consciousness separated from things, which in the dark finds its most intimate relationship with the universe, of almost dissolution, a chamazita, a fiery being, whose interior insists on shining in the dark night. The universe and me. I'm unique. Nothing can divide me without destroying me. I know I am an individual, because I feel it deeply, with an almost painful acuity, even though neurologists tell me about the Self as an evolutionary fiction, structuralists see me as a product of Culture, psychoanalysts as a Family and Marxists as History.

The Taoist philosophy of the beginnings, that of Laozi and the Book of Way and Virtue (《道德经/經》), will choose the water of the ocean and the sea as the privileged image of the Tao (道 Dào), that which cannot be said, without form, on which the universe itself and the ten thousand beings (万物 wânwù) that inhabit it depend, as well as the first principles of existence, the void (無/无 wú), the masculine yang (陽/阳 yáng) and the feminine yin (阴/隂yīn).
This choice of an indigenous Chinese philosophy finds its echo in popular language and philosophy, for example in expressions such as “enormous capacity” (海量Hǎiliàng), which can have both an affective and social interpretation of portentous generosity or magnanimity, as well as a physical and concrete one, applying to someone who can ingest large quantities of alcohol. The sea is also linked to the word good and constant, for example in the “oath of eternal love as energetic as the sea and firm as the mountain”, where mountain lends added firmness to the promise (海誓山盟 or 山盟海誓Hǎishì-Shānméng or Shānméng-Hǎishì).
The ocean, the sea, but also the great rivers are made up of generous water, both in popular and erudite Taoist philosophy.  Here water is the figurative model of the Tao, as read in the Book of Way and Virtue and in the best sinology, which is why we recommend additional reading of Alan Watts Tao: The Watercourse Way.
It is worth paying special attention to the chapters in which water appears as the closest representation of the Tao in the Book of Way and Virtue, namely: chapters 8, 14, 34, 66 and 78.
In chapter 8 we are informed that the Tao is the supreme good “like water” (上善如水) (Abreu, 2014, 43), but it is not water itself. Therefore, it will be due to the similarity of functions that both are compared. Now water is generous, granting life to all beings, without establishing any distinction between them, its gift reaches even those that no one likes and I am thinking, for example, of parasites. It remains close to the earth to fertilize it, it is deep, simple, true, fair and correct and very timely, when it washes and cleans at the right time.
This is also the case with the Tao.  In the first verses of chapter XIV, regarding the Tao, an aquatic image appears again:
 
You look and you don't see,
It's called Indistinct.
You listen and you don't hear,
It's called Silent.
Touch and don't get caught,
It's called Subtle.
This trio is not decipherable
For it merges into a unity
2 (Ribeiro, 2004, 32-33)
And a little later we are told that he is nameless and uninterrupted (繩繩不可名) (Ibidem)
The Tao is like an ocean, an uninterrupted and inexhaustible unity in which someone easily imagines themselves swimming in water that is neither too bright nor too dark, as would happen to Michael Saso in his 14th meditation on the Tao, in A Taoist Cookbook. with Meditations from the Laozi DaodeJing, which he called “Nadar no Tao” (Saso, 1994,47), a meditation that he accompanied by a recipe for spinach, soy paste and sesame, since the wise man is the one who “empties the mind and fills the belly” (虛其心實其復) (Ribeiro, 2004, 10-11), here one feels how the author is immersed in the great Tao, following with the current.
Water can also be represented in a large river, as in chapter 34:
The great Tao floods like a river,
To the left, to the right,
Ten thousand beings depend on him.
（大道泛兮/其可左右/万物恃之而生）
(Abreu, 2013, 94-95)
In the same chapter we are told that the Tao not only gives life but nourishes and feeds, being an essential shelter in the return to the origins, not for death, but for eternal life diluted in the great unity, being therefore great, as big as the sea, or rather the great sea, which is the ocean.
Whoever wants to be as it should be in existence or even correctly govern the world, must follow the model of the water in rivers and seas, as we read in chapter 66:
Rivers and seas are greater than a hundred valleys
Because they remain below them,
and so they are princes, dominating waterfalls and streams.
(江海所以能为百谷王者/以其善下之/故能为百故王)3
(Abreu,2013, 158-159)
The wise man's behavior is distinguished by its malleability and spontaneity. He does not impose himself, which is why he is respected by everyone, only he should then govern, because he acts naturally, without oppressing, without hurting, letting everyone follow their course as freely as possible, as is reiterated in chapter 78:
Nothing in the world is more malleable and flexible
as for water,
but in attacking what is hard and rigid
nothing can surpass it
and there is nothing to replace it.
(天下莫柔弱於水/而攻堅強者莫之能先)
(Ribeiro, 2004 160-161)
Laozi's Taoist water is among the Five Chinese Elements (Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal) the one that evokes great oceanic unity, source of life for everything that exists, but also of death, or rather, of return to origins and eternal life, when this image represents the philosophical principle Tao. And if water, fresh and salty, is the supreme good of the world, the Tao is the origin, the supreme good, including of Heaven. As a root or mysterious female (chap 6) it is the root of the cosmos as we know and experience it. He is a source of spiritual and material life, but so is water, since his model must be followed in all circumstances, from the material source of beings to complex human conduct. People who act correctly, and especially Taoist sages and saints, are aware of the physical and concrete model of water that helps them practice another invisible one, that of Tao.  They will then be malleable and adaptable, capable of nourishing themselves from the inside and giving life to any form on the outside. You will know how to transform yourself to better nourish and vivify.
The Taoist oceanic model differs from the one that inspired the Portuguese throughout history, who looked to the sea as their ocean. Taoist water is not challenging nor does it call for conquest, it does not have cables of storm or hope to bend, it does not require weapons or boats, nor maps, nor nautical instruments. It is the dominant, conquering element within all beings, who will adapt to this most malleable element, without needing to develop their inventive spirit. The philosophy it leads to does not ask for vigilance or a critical spirit, but adaptation to the world as it is and generosity to accept it with a minimum of suffering and a maximum of joy.

Bárbara Morais, main writer of the document, explains the main conclusions of the analysis
A White Paper was launched on December 3rd, which provides a look and analysis of the way in which cooperation in scientific and technological areas between China, Macau and Portuguese-speaking countries has been taking place, outlining some criticisms, not only on this topic, but also on the economic direction that the Macao SAR is taking.
The document, entitled “White Paper on Scientific and Technological Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries”, was produced by the City University of Macau (UCM) and had Bárbara Morais, a doctoral student at the institution, as main writer.
In an interview with HM, she describes that, in Macau, “economic diversification has advanced at a slower pace than desired, keeping the economy structurally dependent on gambling and tourism”.
"The central message of the White Paper is clear: Macau needs to accelerate the transition to functions with greater added value. However, the current context offers a renewed window of opportunity. With the support of the Greater Bay Area and, very specifically, the Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin, Macau now has new structural opportunities to recover lost momentum and reposition itself, not just as a cultural bridge, but as a true platform for innovation", he said.
Still on the territory, but in relation to Forum Macau, the “success in institutionalizing political dialogue” is mentioned, but the White Paper “points the finger at the insufficiency of execution mechanisms”. “To streamline the role of the Forum and transform it into a tool for tangible results, the White Paper advocates a paradigm shift: it is necessary to move from declarations of intent to technicality”, describes Bárbara Morais. The doctoral student suggests “the creation of specialized technical working groups, especially in the technological sphere, and the rigorous definition of performance indicators, such as the number of registered patents, startups created or joint research projects”.
“At the same time, it is suggested to establish a common agenda focused on areas of the future, such as green energy, health, the maritime economy and artificial intelligence, subject to a periodic assessment of progress”, he also said.
The place of arbitration
Taking these meager developments into account, the White Paper suggests that Macau assert itself “as a center for technological arbitration and intellectual property governance”.
HM questioned Bárbara Morais about what should be done in effective terms, taking into account the existence, for several years, of an arbitration center, and the fact that it has been a topic on the territory's political agenda for a long time. The doctoral student highlights that “in order for these ideas, debated for years, to stop being rhetoric and become reality, the Macao SAR needs to create a legal framework specialized in technological disputes aligned with the most demanding international standards”.
"It is essential to attract international experts and arbitrators through competitive incentives and establish an arbitration center that enjoys recognition both in Portuguese-speaking countries and in the Greater Bay Area. The objective is to develop mediation, certification and management services for intellectual property assets, positioning Macau as a 'safe haven', neutral and efficient, for the resolution of international technological disputes", he added.
Unequal cooperation
In global terms, and with regard to cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries (PLP), the White Paper refers to “top planning” by Beijing for cooperation in universities and scientific research. However, planning “does not translate, linearly, into equally effective execution mechanisms on the ground, nor does it guarantee homogeneous results among the nine Portuguese-speaking countries”.
Planning implies “clear guidelines, defined priorities and diplomatic instruments mobilized to guide this cooperation”, with policies such as “Made in China 2025” or the “Digital Silk Road”, which “integrate technological cooperation with the PLP into the very core of Chinese foreign policy and national innovation”, highlights the author.
However, there are “inequalities, which are perhaps the most striking feature of this relationship”, as Bárbara Morais explains. “The current scenario reveals a profound asymmetry, characterized by a ‘bicephaly’ in cooperation. (…) The main scientific capabilities, the robust technological infrastructure and the volume of effective cooperation are overwhelmingly concentrated in Portugal and Brazil”. On the contrary, “Portuguese-speaking African countries (PALOP) and Timor-Leste have a significantly lower participation”.
According to Bárbara Morais, the “disparity does not arise from a lack of political will, but rather from structural funding limitations, a shortage of qualified human resources and the fragility of local research institutions”. Thus, there is “two-speed cooperation, very asymmetrical within the Portuguese-speaking community itself”.
The White Paper highlights the “historic crossroads” in relation to cooperation between China and the PLP, which means “the urgent need to move from potential to implementation” in this matter.
"There are ambitious visions and strategic plans, but practical results remain below what is possible. To resolve this crossroads, the proposed path involves strengthening execution mechanisms, investing massively in talent and technical-scientific education, creating ecosystems of genuine collaborative innovation between China, Macau and the PLP, and, above all, having the courage to measure results and reformulate strategies based on empirical evidence, abandoning the discourse of circumstance in favor of economic and scientific pragmatism."
Gaps in Africa
Another of the conclusions of the White Paper is the “tenuity” of academic links with the African continent, which Bárbara Morais describes as a “fragile scenario”. “There is a triad of factors: the scarcity of installed scientific capacity, the chronic lack of funding and consistent mobility programs”, without forgetting “the absence of stable joint research structures”.
“To bridge this gap and create a lasting critical mass, the White Paper is not limited to diagnosis, suggesting concrete measures such as the robust reinforcement of research grants, the creation of joint doctoral programs, the implementation of collaborative laboratories and the design of academic mobility mechanisms specifically oriented to the African reality”, he adds.
The document also talks about the negative impact of “geopolitical asymmetries”, such as the “technological restrictions of the European Union and NATO on Portugal”. According to Bárbara Morais, “real and restrictive impacts” are at stake. "These limitations condition the participation of Portugal and, by extension, of other Portuguese-speaking actors that cooperate in a network with Lisbon, in high-technology projects that involve China. The impact is particularly sensitive in critical areas such as 5G telecommunications, defense, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, creating barriers that require complex diplomatic navigation."
New strategies
The White Paper was developed at the UCM Research Institute on Portuguese-Speaking Countries, and written by Bárbara Morais with the participation of academic João Simões. The project is based on a review of academic literature on the topic and also on the results of the “Technological Cooperation Launch Seminar”, held on July 22, 2025 at UCM.
The work analyzes areas such as “strategic evolution”, “institutional mechanisms”, “technological milestones” and “structural challenges”, aiming to “provide evidence-based strategies to transform the potential of the China-PLP partnership into a concrete reality, creating a new model of technological cooperation for the Global South”, says a statement from UCM.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 00:53:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Australia | Twelve killed in attack during Jewish festival</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/australia-doze-mortos-em-ataque-durante-festa-judaica/</link><description>At least twelve people died and many injured were transported to Sydney hospitals yesterday, after a shooting attack on the Australian beach of Bondi, while a Jewish celebration was taking place. “There are two people in police custody on Bondi beach”, reported the New South Wales State Police on its X account, which asks “the public to avoid the area”.
Citing police sources, the AFP news agency reports that the attack caused ten deaths. The New South Wales ambulance service confirmed to ABC television that at least 16 people were transported to six hospital centers in the region.
Several witnesses report that it was a shooting attack carried out by an as yet undetermined number of armed people, but the authorities have not confirmed this information either. A British tourist told French news agency AFP that he saw “two gunmen dressed in black and armed with semi-automatic rifles”.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has already issued a statement lamenting the “shocking and distressing scenes” coming from Bondi and confirmed the existence of injuries.
Part of the beach was the scene of a celebration of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, which began yesterday and, although Australian authorities have not yet made any connection with the incident, the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog, denounced what he classified as a “vile terrorist attack against the Jews who were lighting the first candles” of the religious festival.
"Our heart is with them. The heart of the entire nation of Israel beats strong at this precise moment, as we pray for the recovery of the injured, we pray for them and we pray for those who lost their lives," he said in an official statement.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 02:14:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Crime | Government does not release data on suicides and attempts</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/crime-governo-nao-divulga-dados-sobre-suicidios-e-tentativas/</link><description>After the Health Services, the Security department also stopped publishing data on suicides and attempts, after ten years of publication. The absence was noted in the release of crime data for the months of January to September this year, which show the increase in sexual abuse of minors to almost double
 
The Government stopped publishing data on suicide cases in Macau, as well as attempts. The absence of these numbers was noted by the newspaper Cheng Pou when it released crime data for the months of January and September this year on Friday.
The publication even questions whether “the data on suicide has become ‘the secret that cannot be said’ of the authorities, committed to building a happy Macau”, remembering that this data began to be released in 2015. Highlight is the fact that the Health Services also stopped publishing the statistics, something that was done every three months. In the case of the Security Secretariat, the data was monthly and was broken down by sex, age group and methods used.
The lack of numbers comes after Macau broke records in terms of suicide cases in 2024, registering 90 deaths, 2.27 percent more than in 2023. Compared to 2022, the increase was 12.5 percent. Of the 90 cases, 48 ​​concerned male victims and 42 female victims, aged between 12 and 76 years. The most recent data, for the first half of this year, reveals 41 deaths by suicide and 101 attempts.
In the release of crime statistics, on Friday, only one case of death by suicide appears in relation to an episode of homicide between brothers, which occurred in August this year, in the north zone. Here, the older brother jumped from the balcony, being suspected of having killed his younger brother due to financial disputes.
Break in crime
Looking at the crime panorama in general terms, there is a drop of 7.1 percent in the months under analysis, compared to the same period last year. The territory's authorities highlighted the sharp drop in computer crimes. The Secretary for Security, Chan Tsz King, said that the drop is due to the “decreasing trend” of “crimes that attract more attention from society”, including serious violent crime, theft, robbery, fraud and computer crimes.
In the first nine months of the year, 187 violent crimes were recorded, which represents a drop of 11 percent compared to the same period in 2024 (210). Thefts, robberies and frauds fell by 7.7, 5.9 and 23.6 percent, respectively. Computer crime, which recorded 770 cases in the first nine months of 2024, showed a decline of 52.1 percent in the period under analysis, with 369 cases.
The decline in cases of fraud using telecommunications, cyber fraud and computer fraud, said Chan Tsz King, “reflects the effectiveness of the prevention and combat work carried out by the police, and the significant increase in public awareness about fraud prevention”, he said.
The Government also highlighted that crime related to illicit gambling increased by 985 percent between January and September this year, with 394 more cases compared to the same period in 2024. The increase is due to the entry into force, in October last year, of the law to combat illicit gambling crimes, which introduced “the new crime of ‘exploitation of illicit exchange for gambling’ and expanded the scope of coverage of some crimes related to illicit gambling”.
For the same reason, said the secretary, gambling-related crimes soared in the first three quarters of 2025 – 1,737 cases, 70.1 percent more than in the same period last year. In the past, the official said, fraud committed by people illegally exchanging money outside casinos “could not be identified as related to gambling”. “However, with the criminalization of ‘illegal money exchange’ and the improvement of legal provisions”, these cases “are now included in gambling crime statistics, thus increasing the number of crimes”, he indicated.
More abuse of minors
Chan Tsz King, who took office in October and presented the crime report for the first time on Friday, also referred to a 6.1 percent increase in crimes against the person, with child sexual abuse increasing by 86.7 percent, from 15 cases in the first nine months of 2024 to 28 cases in the same period this year.
The secretary explained that these are essentially “voluntary sexual acts between people of the same age”, with “transmission of photographs and pornographic images”, without forgetting cases of “less serious sexual harassment”.
“Cases involving people with family relationships were also identified, which deserves the attention of society”, said Chan Tsz King, who released data on awareness-raising actions on this problem: more than 70 activities carried out by the police, which saw the participation of more than 12,000 people, including students, guardians and teaching staff.
Drug trafficking and sale and drug consumption, in turn, registered an increase of 37.1 percent, with 13 more cases, and 72.7 percent, eight more cases, respectively. According to the secretary's presentation, the 48 cases registered in the three quarters and the respective increase are due to “the discovery of several cases of cross-border drug trafficking through the reinforcement of internal and external police cooperation”, highlighting a case that occurred in September, when 31 kilos of cannabis flower worth 31.77 million patacas were seized. Chan Tsz King said that this was “the biggest case of cannabis smuggling seized in the history of Macau”.
Between walls
In the case of the crime of rape, there was a decline in the number of rape crimes, to a total of 24 cases, 40 percent less than in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretary for Security added that “more than 70 percent of the victims were not residents of Macau”, and “the majority of these crimes occurred in hotel rooms”, while “a number of these involved pecuniary conflicts between the victims and the suspects, and it is not possible to rule out the hypothesis that some of the cases occurred in the context of a sexual transaction”.
In this context, the secretary clarified that the police authorities have been “in close communication with the hotel sector”, and “police devices and inspections in peripheral areas of hotels and casinos” have been reinforced. Between January and September, more than 160 police actions were carried out to combat prostitution, with 192 people suspected of engaging in prostitution activity being intercepted.
Furthermore, during the period in question, 17 cases of pimping or exploitation of prostitution were resolved, with the arrest of 26 suspects.
Silence as always
Questioned by Lusa during the press conference about the first case to be investigated in Macau within the scope of national security, the secretary made no comments. “The case (…) is being handled by judicial entities and, due to secrecy, it would not be appropriate for the Secretary of Security to comment”, added Chan Tsz King, who was a Public Prosecutor when former deputy Au Kam San was detained.
At the end of July, the territory's police announced the arrest of Au Kam San, the first under the state security defense law, which came into force in 2009, with the scope being expanded 14 years later. The accusation is not yet known and there is no information about who will defend the former deputy.

Deputy Chan Lai Kei called on the Government to focus on promoting economic optimism and consumption, considering that in several neighborhoods in Macau the economic situation is worrying, despite macroeconomic growth. The matter was brought to the Legislative Assembly yesterday, an intervention before the agenda in the Plenary.
According to the deputy linked to the Fujian community, the economy is showing a “stable recovery”. Between January and September “the initial value of GDP grew 4.2 percent compared to the same period last year”. It also indicated that the unemployment rate was 2.3 percent between August and October.
However, Chan warned that “positive macroeconomic data have not completely eliminated negative indicators”, especially with regard to the lives of the population.
Citing a “recent study”, the legislator indicated that there is a weak desire to consume, because “residents’ confidence in increasing income and their satisfaction with their financial situation are still between a low and medium level”.
Chan Lai Kei explained that greater consumption abroad contributes to this wave of pessimism, but also the various closures of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs): “In view of the stress of consumption abroad, the business environment of SMEs in areas linked to the lives of the population (such as NAPE, Iao Hon and Fai Chi Kei) continues to worsen and the risk of closure remains”, he warned. “These companies generally face the critical challenge of unstable customer sources, high costs and cross-border consumption”, he stressed.
Given the scenario outlined, the deputy asked the Executive to create a consumption incentive mechanism similar to discount vouchers, but with a permanent nature, while the “transformation phase of Macau's economic model” lasts, which “reinforces confidence in business”.
Improve distribution
Deputy Leong Sun Iok also addressed the situation of the economy and pointed out the need to better distribute resources from gambling, the main industry in the territory.
The legislator linked to the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau praised the gaming concessionaires for the greater role they have taken in terms of investment for “urban development, tourism promotion and social security”, mainly since 2023.
However, he regretted that resources are being channeled unequally: "It appears that, currently, both the revenues from the game and the gaming concessionaire companies themselves have invested a lot of resources in social development. But, in general, these resources are dispersed and lack a system and interconnection, therefore, they are unable to achieve maximum social benefit", he pointed out.
Leong thus advocated that a greater proportion of the revenue collected by the Administration from gambling be channeled to the Social Security Fund, to pay pensions for the elderly.
The deputy also called for the creation of a fund with money from concessionaires to develop the Macao SAR and to ensure that they “better” fulfill the obligations of the gaming law, such as “worker guarantees”, “support for people with disabilities or those rehabilitated”, support for SMEs and “educational, scientific research, environmental protection, cultural and sporting activities and activities of public interest”.
Leong Sun Iok also asked for a new portal with public information on concessionaires' expenses with non-gambling activities covered by the concessions' obligations and ended the intervention with a request for caution addressed to the Executive. “Society’s resources do not come easily and are the result of the joint efforts of the Government, companies, the various social sectors and the population in general”, he indicated. "The situation is not always good. I hope the Government makes good use of the resources arising from the social responsibilities of gaming companies, to improve the lives of the population", he highlighted.
Minimum Wage | Approved increase of one pataca per hour
The increase of one pataca per hour in the minimum wage, from 34 to 35 patacas, was approved yesterday in the Legislative Assembly. With the changes, starting next year, in weekly terms, the salary will go from 1,632 patacas to 1,680 patacas.
When the monthly calculations are made, the salary increases from 7,072 patacas to 7,280 patacas, an increase of 2.9 percent that will cover 4.4 percent of Macao SAR workers. Domestic workers are excluded, although the approval of the hiring quota, in the case of non-residents, is normally associated with the requirement of a salary between 3,500 and 4,000 patacas.
Budget 2026 | Deputies approve the specialty
The Legislative Assembly yesterday approved the budget for next year, which foresees an increase in gaming revenue of 3.5 percent, to 236 billion patacas. The document, which reflects the Executive's economic choices, estimates revenues of 118.8 billion patacas, while expenses are estimated at 113.5 billion patacas.
Based on these perspectives, the final balance of the regular budget should be positive at 5.3 billion patacas. However, there is a possibility that the scenario is actually better, given that the Government tends to make default estimates with regard to revenue and expenses. The budget also once again provides for exemption from paying professional tax, up to 30 percent of the annual amount, limited to 144 thousand patacas.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>EU | New target to reduce 90% of pollutants by 2040</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/11/ue-nova-meta-para-reduzir-90-de-poluentes-ate-2040/</link><description>MEPs and countries from the European Union (EU) yesterday reached an agreement on a target to reduce 90 percent of polluting emissions by 2040, with a view to carbon neutrality in 2050, although new forms of flexibility are foreseen.
“The co-legislators agreed on a target of a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, compared to 1990 levels, with the aim of achieving climate neutrality in the EU by 2050”, is announced in a statement released in Brussels.
After several hours of negotiations, the European Parliament and the Council thus reached, this morning, a provisional political agreement (which will have to be confirmed by both) on an amendment to the EU Climate Law, establishing a new intermediate and binding target for 2040, that of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent compared to 1990 levels.
Even so, MEPs and countries agreed to introduce new forms of flexibility to meet the 2040 target, “believing that the green transition and European competitiveness must advance hand in hand”, according to the note.
Under review
Specifically, from 2036 onwards, up to five percentage points of emissions reductions (two more than the Commission's initial proposal) could come from high-quality international carbon credits, compatible with the Paris Agreement. In the case of Portugal, for example, this means that sustainable projects in countries such as Portuguese-speaking African Countries (PALOP) can count towards the Portuguese target.
“Thanks to Parliament's insistence, additional safeguards were integrated, including the prohibition of financing projects in partner countries that contradict the Union's strategic interests”, highlights the European assembly. It is up to the European Commission to analyze different options for the role of international credits in future EU climate legislation to reach the 2040 target.
Furthermore, the community executive will assess progress every two years, taking into account the most recent scientific data, technological advances and the EU's international competitiveness.
"The review will analyze the situation of net removals at European level, comparing it with what is necessary to meet the 2040 target, as well as possible implementation difficulties and the potential to strengthen the EU's industrial competitiveness. Trends in energy prices and their impacts on companies and families will also be considered", according to the European Parliament.
This will allow Brussels to modify the 2040 target or take additional measures to strengthen the support framework, for example to protect the EU's competitiveness, prosperity and social stability.
Parliament will now vote on the informal agreement and the Council will also have to approve it, with the text coming into force 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. The European Climate Law makes each country's effort to reduce its polluting emissions legally binding.</description><pubDate>2025-12-11 04:37:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Europe | Merz considers aspects of Trump's geostrategy unacceptable</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/10/europa-merz-considera-inaceitaveis-pontos-da-geostrategia-de-trump/</link><description>The head of the German federal government, Friedrich Merz, declared yesterday that there are certain unacceptable points in the document on Defense and geostrategy of the North American Administration led by Donald Trump, from a European perspective. “I don’t see any need for Americans to want to save Democracy in Europe,” he said, on a visit to Rhineland-Palatinate (a southwestern state), which is home to several United States of America (USA) military bases.
In a strategic document on US national security, released last week, there is a warning about the danger of “civilizational extinction” in Europe if “current trends” continue.
Trump, in the preface, summarizes: “we put America first in everything we do”. “It is more than plausible that, in a few decades at most, the members of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) will become predominantly non-European”, he wrote, adding that “it is legitimate to question whether they will perceive their place in the World or their alliance with the USA, in the same way as those who signed the organization's charter”.
The White House regrets European decisions that “undermine political freedom and sovereignty, the migration policies that are transforming the continent [Europe] and creating tensions, as well as the censorship of freedom of expression and the repression of political opposition, the drop in birth rates and the loss of national identities (…)”.
Washington expresses the desire for “Europe to remain European, regain its civilizational self-confidence and abandon its fruitless obsession with regulatory suffocation.”</description><pubDate>2025-12-10 03:31:29</pubDate></item><item><title>East Timor | Memories of a man's life reflect the resistance of a people</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/09/timor-leste-recordacoes-da-vida-de-um-homem-reflectem-a-resistencia-de-um-povo/</link><description>The book “Return to Uaidora, the childhood and youth of Domingos Gusmão” recounts the Timorese's testimonies about the years of Timor-Leste's resistance to the Indonesian occupation. The testimony was written in Macau by former resident and university professor Duarte Trigueiros. 50 years after the occupation, the author reminded HM of the work launched in 2022
This year has been marked by the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the independence of many former Portuguese colonies. Timor-Leste went to one of these territories. However, shortly after the unilateral proclamation of independence, on November 28, 1975, there was a period of confrontation that culminated in the Indonesian occupation, on December 7 of the same year.
This Sunday marks 50 years since the invasion that marked the fate of the young country. In connection with this date, the book “Regresso a Uaidora, the childhood and youth of Domingos Gusmão” was released in 2022, which reveals the story of the Timorese, who was a student in Macau and a student of the author Duarte Trigueiros, former economist and professor at the University of São José. HM spoke to the author about the reflection of the pain and struggle for self-determination of a people that can be seen in the life of a man and his family.
"When I was teaching in Macau, I collected the testimony of this Timorese from Baucau. Domingos Gusmão, knowing that he had taught at the National University of Timor-Leste for several years, told me how he and his family lived through all these terrible events."
This is how the book was born, with Trigueiros merely reporting the testimony, later corrected in partnership with Domingos Gusmão. The work only has an online version, but at the time of launch it had the support of Fundação Oriente in printing some copies. Matebian, East Timor
Duarte Trigueiros, who lived in Macau for several years, came into contact with Domingos Gusmão during the Festa da Lusofonia, in 2015. "I went to the Timor-Leste tent and he told me that he had interesting things to tell me, but that he couldn't speak Portuguese well, and that he would like to leave his testimony in writing. At one point I proposed asking him questions from his childhood, about life in the village, and thus the book was born, with nine chapters.”
The beginning of the work describes, “through the eyes of a child, the day-to-day life of farmers in the Baucau mountains in Timor-Leste, the determination in which they reacted to the invasion of their country in 1975 and the brutal repression that followed”. "The book follows not only his life, but also his family and the few who remained. In the end, there was practically no one left", describes Duarte Trigueiros.
According to the work, Domingos Gusmão was born on November 1, 1969 in the village of Uaidora, belonging to the municipality of Baucau, the son of Julião, a farmer, and Juliana, a maid. "But only the place where I was born is correct. The date of birth is nothing more than a conjecture and the names that appear on the certificate as being my parents, Julião and Juliana, are also not those of my real father and mother, but of relatives who adopted me when I was an orphan. In fact, I am the son of Martinho Gusmão, whose code name was 'Maunoco' and he was the chief of the Uaidora village until his death in 1983; and my mother was Ricardina, Martinho Gusmão’s second wife, the one who gave him offspring.” This is how Domingos’ story begins.
Going to Baucau
The work recounts very difficult years, with thousands of Timorese fleeing into the bush to escape the Indonesians, organizing armed struggle. One of the chapters, highlights Duarte Trigueiros, reports how Domingos and his family "were deported and left without any type of support, without doctors or food. "A huge number of people died at that time, until the beginning of the 80s, and they [Dominicos Gusmão's family], already in the place where they were cultivating the land, began to have fruits from the land, and send children to school. This boy [Domingos Gusmão], during that time, started preparing to go to Baucau to study, something that was not easy, as it was necessary to find a place, and there were many children.” Domingos and Xanana Gusmão
It was there that the family decided to leave the village and go to Baucau, finding jobs “at the service of the troops, judges, nurses and doctors”, which gave them their first contacts with the Timorese resistance.
"He [Domingos Gusmão] began organizing what they called a clandestine front with his colleagues. The book reports all these adventures that clearly reveal how the resistance worked. This boy then felt the desire to continue his studies and applied to a Catholic seminary", recalled Duarte Trigueiros.
The connection to the Catholic religion was not an accident. "The purpose was to go abroad, because the only thing that Indonesians really respected was the Catholic Church, they didn't respect anything else. And he left, spent a number of years training. He was in the Philippines, where he also participated in resistance activities, and returned as a priest, in 2012."
Writing this book was important to Domingos Gusmão because he “wanted to mention the names of the [Timorese] commanders of the first phase, when the Indonesian troops entered through Baucau, towards the interior, and there were a large number of resistance commanders who resisted, almost without weapons, and were killed”. “When he spoke to me about this subject, he was very insistent, he told me ‘Write down the name of that commander.’ Everything so that the names would not be forgotten”, he recalled.
"What he told me is that nowadays, in Timor-Leste, people are compensating the members of the resistance who are alive, but there are many dead who gave their lives for this and are being forgotten. But this book also talks about everything on a personal level, about what happened to the uncle, how the father died at that stage, thrown to the ground, with a gun butt, with kicks, because he refused to accept an order and they threw him to the ground. He was the head of the village and had to accept the order [of the Indonesians], but he refused”, highlighted Duarte Trigueiros.
For the author, the work tells “a truer version” of what the Indonesian occupation was, and very specifically about the experiences of the town of Uaidora and the interior of the country.
In the book, you can read Domingos' testimony about this phase of resistance in Baucau, starting in 1986. “I owe my enlistment in the resistance to the clandestine fronts and also to my colleague Domingos de Oliveira. (…) A few weeks later, on the 16th or 17th of September 1991, the centenary of the Dili cathedral was celebrated and young people were invited to participate. 14 left from Baucau. Buses full of teenagers and I was one of them. The next day, during the return trip, FRETILIN flags appeared and we all sang hymns to independence.
As we passed through Manatuto, the troops ordered us to stop, but then they told us to continue; and at the entrance to Baucau, before the airport, the road was blocked and we were surrounded by a strong military device. There were only three assault cars!”
Gusmão continues his account of this tense moment. "After having cornered us like this, the troops, with the assault vehicles on the right side, occupied the left side. The 14 trucks were lined up with the military device, which had its weapons in position, ready to fire. They were like a very long firing squad. There we stayed, with all those weapons pointed at us, in silence while time passed and nothing happened."
Support from Portuguese
Duarte Trigueiros and Domingos Gusmão kept in touch, but a stroke took away the Timorese's quality of life. "He hardly responds to my emails. Maybe he has a different outlook on life", confesses the author.
Another perspective that the work gives, according to Trigueiros, is the position of the Portuguese authorities during the years of Indonesian occupation, dispelling the idea that there was abandonment after independence. "I simply show what Domingos told me, and he told me that many of the resistance commanders had been Portuguese soldiers and that, therefore, they knew how to use weapons. He also told me that they were extremely patriotic. There is a report that in the 90s they tried to get a satellite phone from Portugal to give to the resistance, and there are references to the support of the Portuguese Embassy in Manila. I think we looked good in the photograph", he concludes.
Duarte Trigueiros taught in Timor between 2004 and 2009, where he found higher education very weak. "The students practically didn't know Portuguese and we had to teach in Portuguese. That alone was a huge effort. In general, the students were weak, they were very poorly prepared. The [educational] preparation of the Indonesians had been of a low level, as there was discrimination against students for being Timorese. The book describes this, how only good students had the right to move up, so to speak, and that didn't even mean going to university."
Even so, Duarte Trigueiros highlights the training of “a good number of people, engineers, law graduates, economists”. “It took a lot of work and that was the great support that Portugal was able to give”, he added.
Today, the former economist says that the Timorese look at the Portuguese with immense gratitude. "It's amazing, because when we go on a street with an Australian, they despise the Australian and don't talk to him, but with the Portuguese they shower him with all kinds of affection. This happens a lot in Timor-Leste", he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-12-09 02:47:45</pubDate></item><item><title>IAM | Resident seeks compensation due to fall on bike path</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/iam-residente-pede-indemnizacao-devido-a-queda-em-ciclovia/</link><description>After suffering injuries due to a fall on the Flor de Lótus Cycle Path, and still holding his arm across his chest, a resident asked for explanations during a session of the Board of Directors of the Institute for Municipal Affairs open to the public
A local resident who suffered a fall on the Flor de Lótus Cycle Path, in Taipa, is demanding compensation from the Government, due to the existence of a hole the size of two thirds of the road. The case, reported by the newspaper Cheng Pou, happened when the resident attended the open-to-public session of the Board of Directors of the Institute for Municipal Affairs (IAM) to ask for explanations.
According to the report, the citizen presented himself with an arm across his chest and stated that he had suffered several injuries on October 31, after a fall while traveling on the Flor de Lótus Cycle Path. The accident was caused by a hole that the victim claims occupied at least two-thirds of the width of the cycle path.
The man suffered several bruises, dislocated a shoulder and also suffered a fractured collarbone, injuries that required him to be admitted to hospital for seven days. The resident is not satisfied with what happened and considers that there was negligence in the treatment of the cycle path by the authorities, and on November 13th he filed a claim for compensation.
Furthermore, the victim attended the December meeting of the Board of Directors of the Institute for Municipal Affairs, where he made an intervention questioning the nature of the inspections. The man questioned how the IAM can claim that it carries out periodic inspections of cycle paths, at the same time that it allows the existence of such a large hole. The victim also questioned whether the hole was due to the use of inferior quality materials.
The resident also pointed out that the hole was filled a month after the accident and questioned the IAM whether it only deals with infrastructure problems after there have been accidents and injuries.
To follow
In turn, the president of the Institute for Municipal Affairs, Chao Wai Ieng, began by wishing the resident who fell from his bicycle a speedy recovery. Regarding the questions raised, Chao Wai Ieng assured that the IAM always strives to “guarantee the suitability and safety of citizens” in the use of all public facilities. The IAM president also stated that the infrastructures are subject to regular inspections, both by the companies carrying out the works and by IAM workers.
At the same time, the guarantee was made that infrastructures with more intense use, such as cycle paths, are subject to frequent and continuous maintenance.
During the open session, the resident revealed that IAM is being represented by a Hong Kong office in the process relating to the compensation claim. This aspect surprised the resident, who admitted to having hung up the phone to the IAM's legal representative, during the first telephone contact, because he thought he was facing an attempted fraud.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:26:37</pubDate></item><item><title>DSAMA | Authorities prepare for dry period</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/dsama-autoridades-preparam-se-para-periodo-seco/</link><description>Local and Zhuhai authorities met on the 19th to discuss preventive water storage to combat saline intrusion, which will lead to a dry period until February. The meeting was held between the Bureau of Maritime and Water Affairs (DSAMA), the Zhuhai Water Affairs Bureau and Zhuhai Water Environment Holdings Group LTD.
Taking into account the forecasts of water authorities in Mainland China, “the natural inflow to the Xi River basin is expected to be between 10 and 30 percent below the average between December 2025 and February 2026, indicating drier conditions than usual this winter and next spring”, is mentioned in the DSAMA statement.
Taking this scenario into account, it was indicated that, currently, “effective storage capacity has reached 90 percent, exceeding the levels observed in the same period of previous years”, and “all reservoirs in Zhuhai are operating with high water levels”, with their maintenance completed before the arrival of this “dry period”.
Susana Wong, director of DSAMA, said that “over the years, the Zhuhai Water Affairs Department has continuously strengthened its capacity to guarantee the supply of raw water to Macau”.
The official also said, regarding the emergency water supply capacity in Macau, that “the project to expand the Seac Pai Van Reservoir is ongoing and its completion is scheduled for 2028”, and “after completion, Macau's water consumption autonomy will increase to 12 days”.
The meeting also served to discuss the price of raw water for the years 2026 to 2028, taking into account that “the Guangdong-Macao Water Supply Agreement provides for a three-yearly adjustment of the price of raw water supplied by Zhuhai to Macau, with 2026 being the next year of adjustment”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:24:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Great Bay | Medicine internship plan with 25 places for residents</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/grande-baia-plano-de-estagios-de-medicina-com-25-vagas-para-residentes/</link><description>Applications are open until January 5th for the “Internship Plan for Young Doctors of Macau in the Greater Bay Area”, which will include training in traditional Chinese medicine and dentistry. The plan is based on partnerships with four hospitals in Greater Bay Area
The application deadline for Macau doctors to undertake medical internships in the Greater Bay Area is now underway. The “Internship Plan for Young Doctors of Macau in the Greater Bay Area” began accepting applications on December 19th, a deadline that extends until January 5th. The plan includes 25 vacancies for Macao SAR residents with degrees in medicine, including traditional Chinese medicine and dentistry. The authorities “recently” organized a clarification session on the plan, according to a statement released yesterday by the Health Services, which was attended by more than fifty young local doctors.
The internships will take place in four hospitals in the Greater Bay Area: the 1st Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, the 5th Affiliated Hospital of the same university, the Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University and the Hengqin Branch of the No. 1 Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University.
According to the Health Services (SS), this measure is intended to “strengthen professional technical skills, competitiveness in the job market and expand the space for development of young doctors in Macau”. It is also intended to “support the integration [of these professionals] into the global national development strategy”.
Alvis Lo, director of the SS, explained that the program “allows access to high-quality national medical training resources”, creating “a systematic and professionalized clinical training platform”.
“Broadening horizons”
Leong Iek Hou, director of the Center for Disease Prevention and Control, said that the plan aims to meet “the needs and gaps that exist in the training platforms for Macau doctors in Mainland China”, thus creating “a broad platform for specialized medical training”. The official stated that she hopes that health professionals can “broaden horizons, improve technical skills and professional competitiveness”.
Recipients of the program are Macau residents who have a certificate of recognition of qualifications in medicine, traditional Chinese medicine or dentistry. There is no age limit, “priority is given to candidates aged 35 or younger”.
Candidates can choose up to two periods of training at the same hospital, depending on “the training period and content provided by the designated medical institution”.  The training lasts three, six or 12 months, “during which you will receive a monthly training allowance worth 10,000 patacas”. The list of admitted professionals will be published on January 26th.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:23:14</pubDate></item><item><title>CCAC | Investigation into special taxis confirmed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/21/ccac-confirmada-investigacao-sobre-taxis-especiais/</link><description>Commissioner Against Corruption, Ao Ieong Seong, assured yesterday that an investigation into the supervision of the special taxi service is underway, but declined to comment specifically on whether the former director of the Traffic Affairs Service Bureau, Lam Hin San, is being targeted.
Speaking on the sidelines of the sovereignty transfer ceremonies, Ao Ieong Seong stated that the investigation is administrative in nature, and seeks to determine whether there was any type of violation of administrative processes in supervising the service.
In June this year, an investigation by the Audit Commission identified several irregularities in the inspection process, which meant that the number of special taxis in circulation never reached the numbers predicted and promised in the public tender. As a result of these failures, it is practically impossible to book a taxi in advance by phone.
Ao Ieong Seong also stated that he is aware of some opinions that there may have been “negligence” by the services in the inspection, but he refused to draw any conclusions before completing the investigation. The director of the Commissariat Against Corruption (CCAC) also addressed the situation of Creche Smart, which has a dispute in court against the Institute of Social Action (IAS).
In March, it was announced that the daycare center managed by the Zona Club de Macau association would see its funding cut by the IAS and that it would have to hand over the facilities where it currently operates. However, the daycare management always challenged the IAS measures and took the case to court.
Ao Ieong Seong stated yesterday that an investigation is underway into the IAS' procedures regarding the daycare center and acknowledged that there is also a case in the courts. However, Ao Ieong Seong promised that the CCAC's findings will not impact the courts' final decision because they are independent investigations. The CCAC director also indicated that she had received various information from the daycare center in more recent times.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Celebration | Sam Hou Fai says Macau “is more vibrant than ever”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/21/celebracao-sam-hou-fai-diz-que-macau-esta-mais-vibrante-que-nunca/</link><description>In his reception speech for the celebration of the 26th anniversary of the establishment of the MSAR, the Chief Executive optimistically praised the moment Macau is going through.
“The great practice of the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle has achieved enormous successes in this promising land that is Macau, this ‘pearl in the palm of the Fatherland’, ‘precious land of the Fatherland’ that gains shine day after day, is more vibrant than ever and opening a phase of development unparalleled in its history”.
Sam Hou Fai's optimistic tone continued, entering into one of the main objectives of successive Macau governments, the economic diversification of the territory, remembering that Xi Jinping “urged Macau to fly higher and go further to achieve greater successes”. The official added that the Chinese President's instructions “are of great significance”, encouraging “to continue the fight with commitment to take a new leap and to create new splendid successes”.
Sam Hou Fai continued, highlighting that Macau is at its best moment of development. Regarding the closure of the satellite casinos, in the press conference that followed, the leader of the Executive reiterated that it is taking place in an orderly manner, and that the approximately 3,500 workers involved have their jobs secured. Furthermore, he added that so far there is no record of complaints filed by workers.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 01:03:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Government | Reinforcing patriotism, security and connection to Lusophony are priorities</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/21/governo-reforco-de-patriotismo-seguranca-e-ligacao-a-lusofonia-sao-prioridades/</link><description>Reinforcing “love for the Fatherland”, national security legislation and links with Portuguese and Spanish speaking countries were priorities outlined yesterday by the Chief Executive on the 26th anniversary of the Macao SAR
“We must (…) comprehensively implement the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots’, to strengthen the foundations of love for the country and for Macau”, said the leader of the Government, Sam Hou Fai, yesterday morning, in a speech in which he mentioned the name of President Xi Jinping nine times, with whom he met this week in Beijing.
The discourse on reinforcing patriotism and love for the country has intensified in recent years in Macau and is present in practically all sectors of society. Also in the local legislative body, as Sam Hou Fai highlighted yesterday. “The election work for the 8th term of the Legislative Assembly was successfully concluded with the effective implementation of the principle of ‘Macau governed by patriots'”, he declared.
In July, the State Security Defense Commission – whose inherent president is Sam Hou Fai – excluded all 12 candidates from two lists competing for the AL, considering them “not defenders of the Basic Law or not faithful” to the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR). One of them was the list of former deputy Ron Lam U Tou, one of the most critical voices of the Government in the Legislative Assembly.
National security also received attention from Sam Hou Fai, who was sworn in exactly one year ago in Macau by Xi Jinping. Sam once again highlighted, as he had already done during the presentation of the Government program for 2026, that he will reinforce legislation for national security. "Security constitutes the condition of development, just as development ensures security. We must consolidate the firm barrier in favor of safeguarding the country's sovereignty, security and development interests, improve the legal regime for the defense of national security and the respective execution mechanism", he indicated.
Iberian horizon
Sam mentioned this week, for the first time, the detention, at the end of July, of former pro-democracy deputy and Portuguese citizen Au Kam San, the first under the Defense of State Security Law, which came into force in 2009 and was extended in 2023. “We detained a former member of the Legislative Assembly for endangering national security”, said the person in charge on Wednesday.
Yesterday's stage was also destined for Lusophony and for the new player in a possible triangular relationship with China: the universe of Spanish-speaking countries. “We will continually expand our international network of partners, acting appropriately as a ‘precision interlocutor’ between China and Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries, transforming Macau into a higher level platform for openness to the outside world”, he promised.
China established the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) as a platform for strengthening economic and trade cooperation with Portuguese-speaking countries in 2003. More than two decades later, the Macau Government expanded the focus to Spanish-speaking countries. Cooperation must focus, as Sam indicated in November in the general presentation of the Government program, on, among other sectors, the areas of finance, culture, tourism and cross-border electronic commerce.
“Thus, Macau, as a bridge between East and West, will be able to shine with renewed splendor in the new era and contribute to the country’s high-quality opening to the outside world”, he stated in yesterday’s speech.
The long-standing goal of the territory's successive governments, the diversification of Macau's economy, which is deeply dependent on the gaming sector, continues to be a priority of the Executive leader, who promised to “persistently concentrate efforts on overcoming obstacles”.
In this sense, he promised, among other actions, to “pragmatically accelerate the construction of the Cooperation Zone”, referring to the Deep Cooperation Zone between Guangdong and Macau, created in Hengqin in 2021, with around 106 square kilometers, to support Macau's economic diversification and integration into the rest of China.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 01:02:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Sam Hou Fai's first year was proactive in diversifying the economy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/20/primeiro-ano-de-sam-hou-fai-foi-proactivo-a-diversificar-economia/</link><description>Analysts told Lusa that the Chief Executive's first year in office was marked by the desire to lead the diversification of the Macao SAR's economy, which is highly dependent on casinos.
Sam Hou Fai, who took office exactly one year ago, “adopted a proactive approach to leading the process of economic diversification”, argued Henry Lei Chun Kwok. The professor at the University of Macau gave as an example the creation of two funds, one to support industries and the other for scientific and technological research, and the creation of a science and technology park. Something that “differs from the previous market-oriented approach, and which is crucial given the uncertainties and weak investor confidence we currently face”, highlighted the specialist in business economics.
The president of the Luso-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry stressed that Sam Hou Fai “did not start from scratch” and that economic diversification was already a Macau policy “in the medium and long term”. "There is, let's say, a train moving and that train continues. You can increase the speed slightly, or reduce the speed, but the path was more or less traced", said Carlos Cid Álvares.
The difference, explained deputy Leong Hong Sai, is that “in the past, the importance of achieving economic and industrial diversification was discussed for many years”. “Now, this is actually being implemented, with general planning and site selection taking place in an orderly manner”, highlighted the vice-president of the General Union of Residents’ Associations of Macau.
Even so, Henry Lei warned that “it may take some time for efforts to produce measurable progress, such as an increase in added value or the share of the technology sector in GDP [Gross Domestic Product]”. Cid Álvares also sees projects that are “interesting and can move the economy”: a cultural zone, under public consultation until December 26th, and the university city in Hengqin.
Iberian tour
Cid Álvares, also executive director of Banco Nacional Ultramarino – part of the Caixa Geral de Depósitos group – believes that the visit that Sam Hou Fai plans to make to Portugal and Spain could help attract companies and investment. “I believe this could make more eyes turn here, because, for me, Macau is not 600 thousand inhabitants, it is 80 million in the Greater Bay Area, with 12 percent of China's GDP”, argued Cid Álvares.
The president of the CCILC says that “there is already greater attention to Hengqin” and predicted that, “in the long term, the borders will be greatly simplified and, therefore, Macau and Hengqin will be more integrated”.
There have been “significant efforts” towards greater integration of Macau, namely “the convergence of legal rules”, but Leong Hong Sai argued that “progress must be accelerated”. Henry Lei, on the other hand, highlighted the priority of “overcoming inefficiency in the mobility of resources, such as capital and information flows, to reinforce integration between Macau and Hengqin [and] attract more cross-border investment”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-20 04:11:40</pubDate></item><item><title>It’s good for Ukraine</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/pra-ucrania-e-que-e-bom/</link><description>I do not discuss the past or the personality of Vladimir Putin. I do not discuss Russia's expansionist policy. I discuss the politics of Portugal and the European Union. In Portugal there are around four million citizens who live on the edge of poverty. There are thousands of Portuguese people with poor pensions. There are elderly people living alone without any medical or social support. There are homes that are human rubbish bins. There are not enough public daycare centers for Portuguese children. There are hundreds of slums. There are hundreds of homeless people, cold and hungry, all over the cities.
There are buildings owned by the Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa, with more than five floors, completely abandoned and in ruins in a country where there is no social housing for young people, the elderly, the disabled and families who survive by having to choose whether to purchase food or medicine. There are young people who, at the age of 40, still live in their parents' homes because they are unable to rent or buy a house, much less live in a civil union with a partner and have children.
There is a Ministry of Defense that announces the future purchase of war material and aircraft worth billions of euros when public hospitals have closed emergency rooms and future mothers are giving birth at home, in ambulances, in private cars or on the street. There are blind and disabled people who cannot use certain Lisbon Metro stations because there are no elevators or escalators. There are prison establishments where inmates are provided with a type of food that even dogs reject.
There are students who finish secondary school and go to work in a restaurant or in the construction industry because their parents do not have money to pay for tuition fees and university supplies. There are beggars asking for money every day in every city in the country. There are more than 100,000 poor people who have been suspended from a miserable monthly income subsidy of 200 euros.
There are poor people stealing chocolate or bread from a supermarket and are immediately taken to a police station. There are no safe institutes that care for women who are victims of domestic violence. There are political parties that advocate the expulsion from Portugal of immigrants who work and contribute to Social Security. There is an annual increase for retirees of three to five euros.
Politics in Portugal, undeniably, despises the poor, with the argument that the State Budget is not enough for more. And, after all, what happens? That the Portuguese Government has sent billions of euros to Ukraine. For a country, whose
Parliament has a majority of neo-Nazis. A country that has corrupt ministers and head of presidential cabinet at the highest level.
A country where President Zelensky has fired minister after minister for embezzling millions of dollars from the European Union and obviously from Portugal. A country where the people are divided between general elections, even in times of war. A country that six years ago was “exporting” to Portugal one of the largest mafias dedicated to human trafficking, serious robberies of value vans, control of prostitution of Ukrainian women disguised as domestic workers, drug sales and money laundering.
Portugal continues to send millions of euros to Ukraine, when its people live in poverty and misery.
A policy of this kind is not acceptable, where people are already afraid to speak out against decisions related to financial support for Ukraine, because they could run the risk of being accused of supporting the communist Putin. It is not acceptable that the policy of North American interests, led by its president Donald Trump, which supports the most diverse neo-Nazi organizations, including Ukrainian ones, leads Portugal to send millions of euros, who knows what destination, and keeping thousands of its children in poverty.
It is urgent and minimally reasonable that the Portuguese government immediately cease sending millions of euros and war material or aircraft to Ukraine, when this money is so desperately needed by the poor residents of the seaside country. Human solidarity is not this. The Ukrainian people have benefited nothing from the millions from Portugal and other European countries. We have reached the point where military material is being sent to Ukraine and many Ukrainian government officials are selling that same material to Afghanistan and other countries like that. Readers must take a position, within each individual's possibilities, to make the Portuguese authorities aware that the situation described here cannot continue. For the good of the Nation.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 02:01:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Policies for attracting investment, valuation services and inspection of the Science and Technology Park</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/20/politicas-de-captacao-de-investimento-servicos-de-valorizacao-e-fiscalizacao-do-parque-de-ciencias-e-tecnologias/</link><description>The Science and Technology Park is linked to the future of Macau
Deputies Lei Wun Kong and Wong Ka Lon
Macau's economy is overly dependent on gaming revenue, but with the emergence of artificial intelligence in the industry, young people are no longer enthusiastic about offline gaming. With the passage of time, changes in the external situation and other factors, gaming revenues may be unstable and affected. Therefore, the Science and Technology Park project is the key to adequate diversification of the economy.
Question: Create and improve policies for attracting investment and post-investment services and supervision of the aforementioned Park
Nowadays, businesspeople are more conservative. To efficiently promote the Park project in question, the Government must take the initiative to attract investments and provide enhancement services. Despite the efforts made by public services, namely the Secretariat for Economy and Finance and its subordinate services, it is necessary to create and improve policies for attracting investment, post-investment services and supervision of the aforementioned Park.
Model: Taking the experiences of model cities in Mainland China as a reference
In recent years, model cities in Mainland China have defined five models for attracting investment. The first is through capital, “funds + industries”, the government creates an industrial fund to promote the implementation of projects, such as the Suzhou biotechnology industry. The second is through a cluster “led by dominant industries”, that is, creating an industrial cluster around dominant companies, for example, in Shenzhen it is Huawei that drives the respective industries. The third is based on “demand-driven supply”, that is, exploring application scenarios to attract technology companies, for example, the company Hangzhou City Brain integrated Alibaba Cloud to develop the application of AI. The fourth is based on “intelligent data matching” to capture digital investments, that is, the creation of big-data to accurately define target companies, such as the “digital investment capture” system in Guangzhou. The fifth is based on “interregional cooperation”, that is, it transcends the delimitation of administrative regions, such as the Shenzhen-Shantou cooperation zone, led by Shenzhen.
Strategy: Develop differentiated policies according to the reality of Macau
Macau, as a micro-economy, in addition to the lack of human resources and land, does not have dominant companies, so it is difficult to create an industrial cluster. Therefore, we must maximize our unique advantages (such as the “one country, two systems” principle, free port, autonomous customs zone, simple tax regime, connection platform with Portuguese-speaking countries and the European legal system, and transform all of this into concrete and attractive points and services for attracting investment), and transform Macau into a platform for interconnection between scientific and technological companies from China and the PLP.
Therefore, we can take the following measures:
1) based on the performance agreement, promote industrial orientation through strategic social participation of the industrial fund, in order to achieve the leverage effect of capital with controlled risk;
2) promote cooperation in attracting inter-regional investment, clearly define the division of labor with Henqin and ensure investment effectiveness;
3) capture local and international talent to attract investments, granting qualified candidates non-permanent resident status;
4) create a large bank to attract investments, etc.
At this time, it is necessary for the Government to implement policies to attract investment through legal incentives aimed at businesspeople who want to enter the park. The investment capture model, operational management and preferential policies, among other key steps, must be clarified. The capture of high-level investments must be ensured and the management process detailed a posteriori, in order to highlight the change in the role of the Government, from manager to service provider, achieving the articulation of these measures with the 15th Five-Year Plan of the Country and the needs and advantages of Macau.
Guarantee: Improvement of value-added services and quantitative supervision
When attracting investments, star cities in Mainland China, in addition to providing value-added services to companies for investment, should facilitate the development of these companies, guiding them towards their continuous growth. Once the process of attracting investments is completed, the phase of monitoring the production value and investment intensity per acre of land follows, which will be used as a basis for determining the value of subsidies and benefits granted by the respective governments.
Although it is difficult for Macau to adopt the quantification model per acre of land, it can carry out an appropriate quantification, taking into account its own needs. For example, taking as quantitative indicators the intensity of employment, the size of investment and possible entry into the capital market. Thus, these values ​​determine the financial support that is granted, as well as tax benefits and other incentive measures. At the same time, as the area of ​​the scientific and technological park and human resources are limited, it is necessary to better define the proportion of each sector, but the blind search for a “large and complete” scope must be avoided. Furthermore, policies should be oriented towards Hengqin-Macao cooperation, cooperation inside and outside the park, and industry-academia-research purposes.
In short, the Government must create an improved system of value-added services and quantitative supervision for attracting investments, in order to achieve advances in several dimensions, namely in “industrial positioning, excellent complementary policies, deep synergy between Macau and Hengqin, the ecosphere of the investment capture process, and the management of business confidence”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-20 04:42:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Is erotic audio storytelling replacing video?</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/19/a-narrativa-erotica-em-audio-esta-a-substituir-o-video/</link><description>Eroticism is gaining a new voice — literally. While video dominated the mainstream sexual imagination for decades, today audio narrative sexual fantasy is experiencing a moment of great popularity: erotic podcasts, apps that tell sensual stories and audiobooks capable of provoking arousal. It is a form of eroticism that appeals to imagination, intimacy and personal experience in a way that visual pornography rarely does.
The audio format works in a radically different way than video. When we watch videos, we receive a ready-made image, a visual script that dictates what should excite us. They are bodies with specific characteristics, many of them with surgical alterations that follow fashions of what is supposed to be sensual or exciting. The audio, on the other hand, works as a suggestion: we are the ones who build the setting, the characters and the chemistry. The narrative comes into play as a kind of trigger — a trigger that allows the imagination to do what it does best: create our own erotic fantasy.
When we listen to an erotic audio story, our brains are not just processing external stimuli; they are actively collaborating with the narrative, filling spaces, generating unique images and sensations. This participation can heighten the erotic response in a way that is different from the more passive experience of watching a screen. These audio stories manage to center the experience on the listener, often placing them in the main role of the fantasy and creating a sense of connection and intimacy that is difficult to replicate on video.
The growing popularity of audio erotica appears to respond to emotional and sexual needs that many people feel are not addressed by traditional forms of pornography. With the narrative, the listener stops being just a consumer and becomes involved in a process of co-creation of the erotic. Apps like Quinn or Dipsea produce narrated stories, often focused on the listener's perspective — with voices, ambient sound and an engaging narrative — rather than explicit images.
It is not only the nature of eroticism that explains this growing popularity, but also the audience for whom these stories are created. Many of these apps and podcasts are designed by women and for women, or for queer people. Pornography, historically associated with the male gaze and desire (with some exceptions), tends to leave out other equally relevant imaginaries. Erotic audio narratives have explored precisely those territories traditionally considered more “feminine”: consent, emotion, vulnerability and female pleasure. Here, the focus on history and anticipation builds a form of eroticism that privileges connection — without ever giving up on excitement.
The success of these apps, podcasts and audio stories suggests that many people are looking for stories that include them and respect their rhythms and desires, especially those who have never recognized themselves in mainstream erotica. The focus on emotional connection, the simple fact that someone whispers sensual words directly into the headphones, creates an intimate and almost confidential experience. This emotional rarity — feeling heard, desired and imagined in the erotic universe — makes audio simultaneously exciting, liberating and safe.
The return to voice can, therefore, be more than a passing fad. It may be a reflection of how we want to experience eroticism today: not as distant spectators, but as active participants in our own erotic co-creation.</description><pubDate>2025-12-19 02:27:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Lessons from 2025 for the Decade</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/licoes-de-2025-para-a-decada-2/</link><description>(Continuation of the article published on December 11)
In the security sector, the world will face complex challenges. Terrorism could take on new forms, using digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Cybersecurity will become a priority, with digital attacks on critical systems posing significant risks. It is estimated that by 2030 the global costs of cyber attacks could exceed US$10 billion annually. On a military level, geopolitical tensions between the United States and China could intensify. The Middle East will continue to be a focus of instability. Between 2026 and 2030, social and cultural scenarios will assume a determining role in shaping the global future. International migration will continue to be one of the most striking phenomena, driven by armed conflicts, economic inequalities and climate change.
It is estimated that hundreds of millions of people may be in a situation of international or internal mobility, either in search of better living conditions or out of need for survival. Europe will face migratory pressures from Africa and the Middle East, with hundreds of thousands of people seeking refuge in countries such as Italy, Greece, Spain and Germany. This flow will require more robust integration policies, but it could also generate social and political tensions, fueling populist and nationalist discourses.
In the United States, immigration will continue to be a central issue, with restrictive policies causing social tensions and protests, but also with the need for labor in sectors such as agriculture, construction and services. In Latin America, internal migration will intensify due to extreme climatic phenomena, such as floods and droughts, forcing millions of people to move from rural areas to cities. In Africa, desertification and armed conflicts in the Sahel could displace more than 20 million people, creating large-scale humanitarian crises.
Urbanization will be another central phenomenon. By 2030, more than 65% of the world's population will live in urban areas, with megacities growing rapidly. Cities such as Lagos, Kinshasa, Mumbai, São Paulo and Jakarta could exceed 30 million inhabitants, facing challenges in infrastructure, housing, transport and sanitation. Accelerated urbanization will bring opportunities for economic and cultural dynamism, but also risks of inequality and social exclusion. Cities will need to invest in sustainable solutions, such as efficient public transport, affordable housing and waste management. The digitalization of cities, using smart technologies, can improve the quality of life, but will require inclusion policies to prevent vulnerable populations from being excluded.
Demographic transformations will be equally decisive. Population aging in Europe, Japan and South Korea will require health and long-term care policies, with an impact on pension systems and fiscal sustainability. It is estimated that, by 2030, more than 25% of Europe's population will be over 65 years old, creating productivity and financing challenges for social systems. In contrast, Africa and parts of Asia will have growing young populations, with millions of people entering the job market. This phenomenon could be an opportunity for economic dynamism, but also a risk of instability if sufficient jobs are not created. India, for example, will have more than 1.5 billion inhabitants in 2030, with a young population that could drive growth, but will require massive investments in education and training. China will face the challenge of an aging population, with more than 400 million people over the age of 60 in 2030, which could limit economic dynamism and increase pressure on healthcare and pension systems.
Cultural scenarios will also transform. Digital globalization will continue to spread cultural values ​​and practices, but also generate tensions between local traditions and external influences. Music, cinema and literature will circulate increasingly intensely, creating a hybrid global culture. However, movements asserting identity and valuing local cultures will gain strength, seeking to preserve traditions and resist cultural homogenization. Cultural diversity will be both a wealth and a challenge, requiring policies of inclusion and respect for difference.
Migration, urbanization and demographic transformations will interact with environmental and technological phenomena. Cities will have to adapt to extreme weather phenomena, such as floods and heat waves, which will affect millions of people. Climate migration will become a reality, with entire populations moving due to rising sea levels and desertification. Accelerated urbanization will require technological solutions, such as smart cities and sustainable infrastructure, but also social policies to ensure inclusion. Demographic transformations will create new balances of power, with Africa and Asia gaining demographic and economic weight, while Europe and Japan will face aging challenges.
In summary, the period between 2025 and 2030 can be described as a critical transition phase, in which the events of 2025 acted as catalysts for structural changes that manifested themselves in different dimensions. The global economy entered a cycle of moderate recovery, but with persistent risks. International politics was marked by polarization and geopolitical tensions, with the United States and China competing for technological and industrial leadership, and the Middle East remaining a focus of instability. The environment has revealed the urgency of the energy transition and climate adaptation, with extreme phenomena affecting millions of people. Technology has transformed economies and societies, creating opportunities and risks. Education and health required inclusive and innovative policies. Security has become a priority, with cyberattacks and digital terrorism posing significant risks. The social and cultural scenarios revealed the importance of migration, urbanization and demographic transformations.
The future will depend on the ability to articulate national interests with collective responsibilities, building a balance between competitiveness and solidarity. If countries are able to invest in responsible innovation, inclusive education and energy sustainability, it will be possible to build a fairer, sustainable and inclusive future. Otherwise, the risk of prolonged stagnation and worsening inequalities will remain high. The period between 2025 and 2030 will therefore remain a decisive moment, in which humanity was called to choose between cooperation and fragmentation, between the courage to move forward and the risk of remaining a prisoner of its own contradictions.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:18:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Death | French actress Brigitte Bardot dies aged 91</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/obito-actriz-francesa-brigitte-bardot-morre-aos-91-anos/</link><description>Brigitte Bardot, one of the biggest stars in world cinema, passed away yesterday at the age of 91. The actress had been admitted to the hospital in the city of Toulon, in the south of France, since November.
In a statement, the Brigitte Bardot Foundation announced her death with “immense sadness”, describing her as a “world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation”.
Known for her enormous impact on cinema in the 1950s, «BB», as she was widely called in France, was an essential ingredient of French culture and quickly became an icon after her first role in Le Trou Normand (1952). Two more films followed in 1952, when she married director Roger Vadim. A year later, Bardot conquered Hollywood and the United States, and her popularity as one of the sexiest women in the world was firmly established.
Brigitte Bardot continued to act in a total of 28 films over two decades and became a symbol of women's sexual liberation. However, ruthlessly “marketed” as a sexual and hedonistic symbol, Bardot ended up succumbing to the frustration of not being taken seriously as an actress and abandoned her career to dedicate herself to campaigns for animal welfare.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:46:14</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinematheque Paixão | “Battle After Battle” to see on the last day of the year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/cinemateca-paixao-batalha-atras-de-batalha-para-ver-no-ultimo-dia-do-ano/</link><description>Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, “Batalha Atras de Batalha”, will be shown at Cinemateca Paixão on the last day of 2025. In January, the film schedule will include Pedro Almodóvar's latest film, “The Room Next Door” and the new film by local director Tracy Choi
In a dystopian scenario that, deep down, is not so different from what we live in today, there are people like Perfidia Beverly Hills, a revolutionary woman who seeks a fairer life for everyone. Perfidia maintains a relationship with another revolutionary, Bob Anderson, with whom she has a daughter, until one day everything goes wrong and Perfidia is forced to hide from everything and everyone, leaving her daughter with her father. In between, there is a soldier who will dedicate his life to persecuting this man and his daughter.
Here is the synopsis of the film “Battle After Battle”, by Paul Thomas Anderson, which in almost three hours not only tells a story but also analyzes the current times in which we live, addressing topics such as immigration, social justice, racial struggles and the utopia of a better world. It is with this film that Cinemateca Paixão closes the year 2025, with a single screening on Wednesday the 31st, starting at 7:30 pm, just in time to leave the cinema and go celebrate the arrival of 2026.
But the last days of the year also hold another cinematographic “cartridge”, with the screening of “Die My Love”, shown tomorrow, starting at 7:30 pm. The first day of the year brings “Flow – À Deriva”, which won the Oscar for Best Animated Film and which tells the story of a kitten who fights for survival in a world that is changing rapidly.

Cinemateca Paixão's program for January, entitled “Encantos de Janeiro”, also features the most recent film by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar, and also his first film in English. “The Room Next Door” stars Julianne Moore and Tilda Swinton in the main roles and is a film that celebrates themes such as friendship, the meaning of life and euthanasia. The story begins when one of the women, upon learning that she suffers from a terminal illness, decides to take refuge in a house and ask a longtime friend to take care of her until the inevitable end. The public also has a session available on January 10th.
On January 3rd, Cinemateca Paixão shows the documentary “Four Trails”, by director Robin Lee, which is a celebration of the nature that Hong Kong has in addition to the hustle and bustle of the city. This is the true story of Andre Blumberg, who in 2012 set himself the challenge of doing Hong Kong's four long-distance trails in just 72 hours, which translates into 298 kilometers. It is one of the most difficult marathons in the world, called the Hong Kong Four Trails Ultra Challenge.
Tracy Choi's new
Another major highlight of Cinemateca Paixão for the first days of the new year is the possibility of seeing the new film by local director Tracy Choi. “Girlfriends” will be shown on the 6th and 24th of January, after the film had its world premiere at the Busan International Film Festival, as part of the “Vision Asia” section. Elizabeth Tang, the film's actress, was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress award at the 62nd Golden Horse Awards, Taiwan's film awards.
“Girlfriends” is about a girl who becomes a woman through three love stories set at the age of 17, 22 and 34, when she already has another maturity. It is a journey in search of love. Tracy Choi has had an acclaimed career in cinema since releasing “Sisterhood”, her first feature film.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:42:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Music | Colégio Moderno Orchestra live at Our Lady of Fátima Church</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/21/musica-orquestra-colegio-moderno-ao-vivo-na-igreja-nossa-senhora-de-fatima/</link><description>On the 29th, the Colégio Moderno orchestra performs in Macau at the Church of Our Lady of Fátima, followed by a concert, on the 3rd of January, with the Macau Youth Orchestra. Pianist Adriano Jordão, founder of the Macau International Music Festival, highlights the importance of sharing music between the two orchestras
 
After a summer of intense musical sharing in Lisbon, the Macau Youth Orchestra and the Colégio Moderno orchestra are preparing to perform in Macau in the coming weeks. On the 29th at 8pm, the Church of Our Lady of Fátima hosts the “Concerto do Colégio Moderno”, performed by the orchestra group from the school founded in 1936. Then, on the 3rd of January, it is the turn of the two groups to take the stage at the Macau Cultural Center for the “Macau New Year Concert 2026”.
Pianist Adriano Jordão, founder of the Macau International Music Festival (FIMM), has been following the partnership between the two groups and the work done by the Colégio Moderno group. The musician highlights to HM what can be heard at the concert on December 29th: the composition “Stabat Mater”, by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, which was part of the program of the first edition of FIMM.
“It has a symbolic side, because it was the performance at the first International Music Festival, in 1987. It was done to close the festival, so there is a psychological side to the repetition of this work”, he highlighted. “All of this was my idea, a little nostalgia doesn’t hurt”, added Adriano Jordão. “This is a work with all the characteristics to be done within a church, and it also has this symbolic side that is very important to me.”
“Stabat Mater” is a sung prayer, central to a concert program lasting around an hour, designed for “a relatively small group of instrumentalists, with two soloists”.
Adriano Jordão highlights the great enthusiasm of the members of the Colégio Moderno orchestra regarding the trip to Macau. "I see the kids' excitement about going to Macau, there is always a fascination with the East, as is evident. And I see the historical interest that all of this has, particularly for Portugal. There really is a cultural interest in maintaining a Portuguese brand in Macau, which is Chinese territory. [These concerts] serve to accelerate these cultural links."
Quality work
It is not the first time that Adriano Jordão has collaborated with the Macau Youth Orchestra, which in the summer of this year was in Portugal for joint performances with the group from Colégio Moderno. Colégio Moderno was founded in 1936 by João Soares, father of Mário Soares, former President of the Portuguese Republic, now deceased, himself a figure closely linked to Macau. This time, Isabel Soares, current director of Colégio Moderno, will be present in the territory for the concerts.
Although the Portuguese school orchestra group has been in existence for more years than the formation of the local youth orchestra, this does not invalidate the quality of both projects, and some challenges were faced in bringing this group to Macau. "It is always difficult to take a group of people [for a trip of this type], and it is necessary to find the financial resources on one side and the other. This was done with private support and it was achieved. I am very happy that young people from Macau have made such a good impression in Portugal. I hope that this good figure is now reciprocal on this trip to Macau."
The Macau Youth Orchestra considers, in a statement, that the exchange and collaboration of Isabel Soares and Adriano Jordão, accompanying the Colégio Moderno orchestra, represents “a concrete demonstration of the Macau Youth Orchestra's ongoing commitment to promoting international cultural exchange”. The concerts in question also constitute “a new page in Sino-Portuguese cultural exchange, particularly in musical exchange between young people from China and Portugal”, it is said.
Asked about the importance of FIMM nowadays, Adriano Jordão did not fail to remember that what “seemed like a crazy idea at the time” actually had legs to walk on.
"There was strictly nothing in Macau, in cultural terms: there was no cultural center, and the first things [shows] that were done were in a sports hall. There were no resources, there was no Macau orchestra. Everything was done from scratch and to see that, years later, it was worth doing... I was at the last edition, last year, and I was impressed to see that a great artistic quality was maintained", he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 01:12:28</pubDate></item><item><title>IC | Helena Almeida's first solo exhibition in Asia arrives in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/20/ic-primeira-exposicao-individual-de-helena-almeida-na-asia-chega-em-2026/</link><description>The year 2026 Macau hosts a major exhibition on Portuguese artist Helena Almeida. “Helena Almeida: I’m Here – Presença and Resonance” is scheduled to take place at the beginning of the year, being the artist’s first major solo exhibition in Asia. The Macau Museum of Art also presents works by Chinese artists interacting with the work of Helena Almeida
The Government announced this Thursday the opening of an exhibition of Chinese artists, invited to interact with the work of Helena Almeida (1934-2018), in anticipation of the Portuguese artist's first major solo exhibition in Asia.
“Helena Almeida: I’m Here – Presença and Resonance” will open at the beginning of 2026, with around 42 sets made up of 190 pieces by the Portuguese artist, according to the statement. In the note, the Cultural Institute (IC) also announced that the exhibition “Resonância – Corpo. Objecto. Reflexão”, marked by Chinese artists' interpretations of the Portuguese artist's work, will be on display at the Macau Art Museum from December 19th to April 26th.
The exhibition brings together “recently commissioned works” by six artists from Macau and mainland China, invited “to foster a dialogue that transcends time and space” with Helena Almeida, said the IC. You can see drawings by Erica Min Han, a Chinese artist based in London, which “continue Helena Almeida’s reflection on the presence of the body”.
In turn, the work by the Chinese Gao Fuyan “A Grade of the Mind”, embroidered with hair on paper, “remotely mirrors Helena Almeida's concept of the body as an instrument”, said the IC.
Also Chinese, Sun Xiaoyu “adopts Helena Almeida’s blue to expand the visual dialogue about existence and its borders through the oriental aesthetic practice of dissolving the self in the object”, the note states. The IC highlighted that this exhibition aims to “strengthen the exchange of contemporary art” and the “cultural dialogue” between China and Portugal, paving the way for the great retrospective.
A full life
Born in Lisbon in 1934, Helena Almeida created, from the 1960s onwards, a multifaceted work that stood out for its self-representation, reflecting on the tension relationships between the body, space and the work. He used the body as a support and creative object, using painting, photography, engraving, installation and video.
Helena Almeida studied painting at the Escola Superior de Belas-Artes in Lisbon, beginning to exhibit individually in 1967, at Galeria Buchholz. One of the artists who marked her journey was Lucio Fontana, and initially Helena Almeida even exhibited torn canvases similar to this artist's work, “canvases with the back facing forward, thus showing what was traditionally facing the wall”, describes Joana Simões Henriques regarding an exhibition with works by Helena Almeida recently held at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation museum, in Lisbon.
But from 1975 onwards the artist “began to explore other disciplines such as drawing, photography and video, seeing them as means to understand the relationship between the author's body and the space of the work”.
It is here that the artist’s body becomes “the support of her art, becoming subject and object, not in the form of a self-portrait, but rather in the sense of ‘inhabiting the painting’, of placing herself within her work, of being her work”. In these works, “[Helena Almeida’s] face often appears hidden”, it is described in the same note.
In 1977, the exhibition “Alternativa Zero” took place in Portugal, described as “marking in Portuguese contemporary art”, presenting “a series of photographs [by Helena Almeida] with elements attached to the image, thus creating the illusion of the work leaving its place and entering the space of the observer”, wrote Joana Simões Henriques.
The artist represented Portugal at the Venice Biennale on two occasions: in 1982 and 2005, and in 2004 she participated in the Sydney Biennale, with her work being exhibited in individual and collective exhibitions in national and international museums and galleries.
In 2015, he presented a traveling solo exhibition Corpus at Fundação de Serralves (2015), in Porto, in Paris (2016), in Brussels (2016) and Valencia (2017). In 2017, he also presented a solo exhibition “Work is never finished” at the Art Institute, in Chicago, in the United States.
His work is present in Portuguese and international collections such as: Berardo Collection, Lisbon; Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon; Serralves Foundation, Porto; Hara Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo; Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid; MUDAM – Musée d’Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean, Luxembourg; Tate Modern, London.</description><pubDate>2025-12-20 04:39:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Analysts highlight challenges in Macau’s economic growth</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/analistas-realcam-desafios-no-crescimento-economico-de-macau/</link><description>Experts contacted by the Lusa agency foresee challenges in the growth of Macau's economy for 2026, with the recovery of the gaming sector contrasting with weak domestic consumption and pressure for diversification.
Economist Henry Chun Kwok Lei, professor of Business Economics at the University of Macau and vice-president of the Macau Economic Association, maintains a “cautiously optimistic” outlook for 2026, predicting Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of around 2.5 percent during the next financial year.
“The high base of gross gaming revenue this year, projected between 246 and 248 billion patacas, will condition the growth potential in 2026. Even if casino revenue increases by around 4 percent, to more than 250 billion patacas, its contribution to global economic growth will decrease,” Henry Lei told Lusa.
Ben Lee, a consultant for gaming activity in Southeast Asia, has a more positive outlook. “Gross gaming revenue has already reached 226.5 billion patacas by November this year, so it is more than likely that we will exceed the projection of 228 billion,” he said.
The estimate for game revenue for 2026, the analyst added, is “a little conservative”. “Unless we go back next year, based on the current situation, gross revenues could reach a value between 260 and 270 billion patacas by the end of 2026”, he estimated.
Alarms sounded
The forecast included in the Budget for 2025 pointed to total revenues of around 240 billion patacas, but the weak start of the year, especially after the tariff war triggered by the USA, raised alarms among the economic team of Sam Hou Fai's Executive, which approved in June an Amending Budget in which it cut 4.56 billion patacas in the revenue forecast, highly dependent on the gaming sector (around 83 percent of Macau's GDP).
The Macau Economic Association predicts that annual GDP growth in 2025 will be around 5.4 percent, an estimate based on the “stable and positive trend of the main indicators of economic development, the globally stable functioning of the budgetary and financial systems and the maintenance of low unemployment rates”.
As for next year, adds the association, “the Macau economy is expected to maintain a stable and positive trajectory”, although the global panorama “continues to be characterized by interconnected turbulence and complexity”. The Government Budget for 2026 points to a 3.5 percent increase in Macau casino revenues next year, reaching 236 billion patacas, still the highest value since the pandemic.
Other critical challenges that Macau faces in 2026 are stimulating local consumption and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Speaking to Lusa, Lei Choek Kuan, president of the Federation of Industry and Commerce of Macau, pointed to the “irreversible” change in consumption patterns underway and highlighted the importance of government support for companies to maintain confidence.
Economist Henry Lei advocates a deeper structural transformation that goes beyond subsidies and suggested that local SMEs should look for differentiation and premium services — such as “improving after-sales service, developing creative cultural products and creating high-end culinary experiences” — to serve a niche demographic with high purchasing power, rather than competing on price with Mainland China.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 02:03:33</pubDate></item><item><title>CPSP | Officer drives drunk, has accident and flees the scene</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/cpsp-agente-conduz-bebedo-tem-acidente-e-foge-do-local/</link><description>The 31-year-old police officer tested the balloon and found 1.88 grams of alcohol per liter of blood. In addition to criminal liability, the CPSP initiated disciplinary proceedings against the agent
An officer from the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) is being subject to disciplinary proceedings for driving drunk, crashing his vehicle into a flowerbed and fleeing the scene. The incident happened in the early hours of December 24, when the 31-year-old man was off duty, and is therefore being investigated for the crimes of driving while drunk and evading responsibility.
According to authorities, the case was detected in the early hours of December 24, when the police were called to the intersection between Rua da Barca and Rua de João de Araújo, after a vehicle crashed into a flower bed. The result was a scene of destruction that did not miss metal posts and a flowerbed.
After identifying the vehicle involved in the accident, authorities approached the off-duty officer, who appeared to have a strong smell of alcohol. Suspicions that were confirmed by the balloon test, which showed a result of 1.88 grams of alcohol per liter of blood.
Furthermore, the detainee's vehicle had been parked illegally. The case was forwarded to the Public Prosecutor's Office, and the agent is charged with the crimes of driving while intoxicated, which carries a sentence of up to 1 year in prison, and evading responsibility, which carries a prison sentence of up to 1 year.
Alarm ringing
The fact that the suspect was a CPSP agent meant that the accident merited a police reaction, via the security department's website. “The CPSP deeply regrets the case of drunk driving by a police officer, reiterating that it has always given great importance to the disciplinary behavior of its personnel” was published.
The CPSP also guaranteed that the acts of agents “that violate the law and discipline are treated severely and in accordance with the law”. In addition to criminal liability, the CPSP opened a disciplinary investigation on the same day “to implement disciplinary liability in accordance with the law”.
In response to the incident, it is stated on the Secretary for Security's portal that “all departments received immediate instructions to continuously reinforce the awareness and education of their subordinate officers, reminding officers that their personal conduct is linked to the positive image of the police force”. It was also highlighted that even when officers are “off duty” they must “maintain the highest standards of self-discipline and comply with laws and regulations”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:39:29</pubDate></item><item><title>L’Arc | SJM obtains authorization for direct exploration</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/larc-sjm-obtem-autorizacao-para-exploracao-directa/</link><description>The concessionaire, SJM Resorts, obtained authorization to operate the Casino L’Arc Macau, under the form of direct management and exploitation, from 2am on December 30th.

The position was taken in an interview with am730 station, cited by Macau News Agency.
According to Shih, in the last five years the price of housing in Macau has decreased by 40 percent, largely driven by the birth rate, currently 0.68 children per woman. Therefore, he appealed to the authorities to ease immigration policies, so that the price recovers again. "The continued decline has depleted residents' confidence. Even buyers are hesitant to enter the market, fearing losses in asset values," he said.
The official also admitted that the Government is not exactly concerned, despite the buyers' losses: “They thought that lower house prices were not necessarily a bad thing, and that young people could thus enter the real estate market — a situation that could help with social stability, with fewer complaints”, he added.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:32:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Tai Fung Bank | Fitch reduces financial viability rating</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/banco-tai-fung-fitch-reduz-rating-de-viabilidade-financeira/</link><description>The performance of loans linked to the real estate market in Mainland China is highlighted by the rating agency as the main factor for reducing the rating to the “bb” level. The assessment on the debt issuance was maintained at “BBB+”
The financial rating agency Fitch reduced Banco Tai Fung's financial viability rating from “bb+” to “bb”, warning of the possible impact of unexpected events on the institution's survival. The change was announced last week and justified by the impact of loans to the Mainland China real estate market on the bank's financial performance.
The “bb” level is the fifth highest on the 10-level financial viability rating scale, but indicates the existence of “high vulnerability” in the bank’s viability, if there are “unexpected changes in long-term commercial or economic conditions”.
The change in the financial viability rating comes despite Fitch recognizing that there are “moderate” expectations of the bank's continued viability and “strong financial strength”, linked to the fact that Banco Tai Fung is owned by the Bank of China.
However, loans linked to the property market in Mainland China are a concern. Fitch indicates that at the end of the first half of this year, loans represented 22 percent of the bank's total assets, an exposure considered “above the banking system average of 15 percent”. “We predict that the real estate market will take time to recover, prolonging the bank’s financial recovery”, indicated the agency.
In negative terms, Fitch also highlights the lower quality of the bank's assets, because the rate of non-performing loans remains “too high”, at 15.8 percent of the total of these loans.
The default rate is also highlighted as a factor in the significant reduction of the bank's profits, not only due to the loans that remain unpaid, but also because the market will have a lower demand for loans, which has been one of the supports of the institution's commercial model.
Support from above
Despite the challenges, the bank has in its favor the fact that it is owned by the Bank of China, which analysts believe is ready to inject money into Tai Fung. The connection with the Bank of China means that the assessment on the debt issuance is maintained at “BBB+”, the fourth highest level of the 11 that constitute the rating.
The Chinese state bank has a higher rating than Tai Fung in terms of debt issuance rating. Given this difference, Fitch admits an upward revision of Tai Fung's level, if there are signs that the Bank of China is ready to inject capital into the institution founded by Ho Yin.
In terms of Tai Fung's operating environment, Fitch highlights that it is the fourth largest bank in Macau, measured by loan value, where gaming is expected to continue to drive economic growth.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:29:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Unemployment | Global and resident rates unchanged</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/desemprego-taxas-global-e-de-residentes-sem-alteracoes/</link><description>The Statistics and Census Services Directorate (DSEC) revealed that the unemployment rate, in global terms, was 1.7 percent between the months of September and November; while the unemployment rate for residents stood at 2.3 percent over the same period. According to a statement from DSEC, these are the same rates compared to the months of August to October this year.
DSEC highlights that the number of unemployed residents was 6,700, with the majority of those looking for work “previously working in the retail trade and lotteries and other gambling sectors”. Also noteworthy is a 0.5 percent increase in residents looking for their first job, a category that represents 14.4 percent of unemployed people with resident status, also in the months of September to November.
Another figure announced concerns the number of underemployed residents, 5,900, “noting that the majority belonged to the sector of real estate activities and services provided to companies, the transport and storage sector and the retail sector”.
According to preliminary estimates from migration records, the average number of MSAR residents and non-resident workers, who worked in the MSAR but lived abroad, was estimated to be around 109,300 in the reference period. The total workforce, made up of these individuals and the active population living in the Macao SAR (385,600), was 494,900 people, 2,700 more than in the previous period.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Airport | Chan Chak Mo's company wins competition</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/21/aeroporto-empresa-de-chan-chak-mo-vence-concurso/</link><description>The Bright Luck Gourmet Company, which is part of the Future Bright group, controlled by former deputy Chan Chak Mo, won the public tender to supply meals to SEMAC, the company responsible for airport security.

A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negociar o quê? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.

At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke at length and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. It says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no such thing as chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is usually used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in others. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this mistake. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who didn't love anyone./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria stayed with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely outside our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J. Pinto Fernandes emerges at the exact moment when we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but this only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows everyone else and the joy of recognizing that the yardstick of the world is not measured with my short measure and that, on the contrary, it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican for writers from the north, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thought about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché “all different, all equal”, a return to “diplomacy”, given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that “we are unified because we share the same nature” but simply highlights that we “still do not share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that quenches your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and impressive, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unresponsive to reins and containment.
Let men refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish, because of it the tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the pride of the countries will be destroyed.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert”.
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that muzzle, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relationships were restricted, or if it merely lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Both poets, driven by a certain idea of ​​sanctity, had the same inability to break the siege of their skin with the overflow of someone else's dam, the same curse of sublimating the concrete ferocity of eros with the gentleness of the verses.
Obviously, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as a hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, deferred, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE

Helahoho! helahoho!
The poor widow's sewing machine who was bayoneted...
She sewed indefinitely in the afternoon…
The table where the old people played,
Everything mixed, everything mixed with bodies, with blood,
All one river, one wave, one dragging horror.
Helahoho! helahoho!
I unearthed the child's tin train pressed into the middle of the

And I cried like all the mothers in the world about the horror of life.
My pantheistic feet tripped over the sewing machine
[widow who was killed with a bayonet
And that poor instrument of peace stuck a spear in my heart.
Yes, I was the one to blame for everything, I was the soldier for them all
Who killed, raped, burned and broke,
It was me and my shame and my remorse like a shadow
[misshapen
They travel around the world like Ashavero,
But behind my steps there are footsteps the size of infinity
And a physical fear of being accountable to God makes me close my eyes.
[eyes suddenly.

I ordered, captain, to shoot the trembling peasants,
I let the daughters of all fathers tied to trees be raped,
Now I saw that it was inside my heart that all this happened,
And everything scalds and suffocates and I can't move without it
[everything be the same.
God have mercy on me, I didn't have it from anyone!

What is clear today, at this disastrous moment in which Cristiano &amp; Companhia failed in their mission in Braga, and in which the self-sabotage of Russia's gas pipelines reminds us that Putin will be willing to do anything to maintain dominance over the areas endorsed,
is that, bomb for bomb, the “bomb” of the Fifth Empire was preferable.

“As China's economic model loses steam, African leaders will have to plan growth and economic transformation aware that their largest trading and investment partner could have a very different profile than it has had until now”, reads the analysis carried out by the group, based in New York.
Angola is identified as one of the countries most sensitive to the evolution of the second largest economy in the world. China is one of the main destinations for Angolan crude and the report anticipates that Chinese imports of African oil are expected to stagnate or decline, as Beijing accelerates the energy transition, expands the fleet of electric vehicles and reduces the energy intensity of its economy.
This scenario could put pressure on tax revenues, exports and Luanda's ability to honor its external debt, in a context in which the country already pays more to China in repayments than it receives in new loans.
Mozambique may have a different trajectory. Although also exposed to Chinese demand for raw materials, the report anticipates a structurally robust demand for strategic minerals associated with the energy transition, such as graphite and other critical minerals, sectors in which Mozambique has been gaining relevance.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:58:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Comércio externo | Revised law with reinforcement of responses to “external struggles”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/29/comercio-externo-lei-revista-com-reforco-das-resposta-a-lutas-externas/</link><description>China approved on Saturday a revision of the foreign trade law, which strengthens the legal framework for the development of cross-border trade and expands legal tools to respond to “external struggles”.
According to the state agency Xinhua, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (APN, legislative body) gave the 'green light' to the new version of the standard, which will come into force on March 1, 2026, after a vote held this Saturday. The revised law incorporates a series of reforms, which until now were applied through regulations or sectoral policies.
These include the system of negative lists for cross-border trade in services, support for new formats and models of external trade, the push for digital trade and the acceleration of the construction of a “green” trade system. The text also establishes provisions for the State to advance in alignment with “high-level international economic and commercial standards” and participate in the formulation of global rules in this field, according to Xinhua.
With the aim of optimizing the environment for foreign trade, the law also reinforces the protection of intellectual property rights linked to international commercial activities. In this sense, it stipulates that the State will improve the level of regulatory compliance of foreign trade operators and their ability to manage risks related to intellectual property.
The standard also introduces a commercial adjustment assistance system, aimed at “stabilizing industrial and supply chains”, an aspect that has gained relevance in recent years in the face of commercial and technological frictions with the United States and other partners.
In time of truce
One of the highlights of the review is the expansion and improvement of the so-called “set of legal tools” for the defense of China's external interests, at a time marked by the trade truce reached with the United States and the persistence of tensions with other actors, such as the European Union.
The reform is approved weeks after Beijing and Washington agreed to a one-year trade truce, which includes tariff reductions and the temporary suspension of some restrictions, although Chinese authorities have insisted, in parallel, on the need to protect national economic security.</description><pubDate>2025-12-29 01:54:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Taipei | At least three people died in subway attack</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/21/taipe-pelo-menos-tres-pessoas-morreram-em-ataque-no-metro/</link><description>At least three people died and five were injured following an attack in the Taipei subway, the Taiwanese capital's fire chief announced Friday, adding that the suspect also died. The attacker wore a mask and was armed with a knife when he threw “five or six Molotov cocktails, or smoke grenades” at Taipei's main metro station, the fire chief explained in statements to the France-Presse news agency.
According to local authorities, the incident began in the underground passage of Taipei Main Station at around 5:30 pm when the suspect threw several smoke bombs as a distraction before heading with a knife along the avenue that connects this station to Zhongshan.
The mayor of Taipei, Chiang Wan-an, told the press that the suspect apparently “committed suicide by jumping from a building to escape his arrest” and that one of the victims died while trying to prevent the attack at Central station, the main subway station in the capital of Taiwan.
One of the victims died from injuries caused by the sharp weapon and a second died from a cardio-respiratory arrest caused by the grenades thrown by the attacker, according to the official CNA news agency.
A previous report showed at least eight injured. The attacker was identified by the CNA agency as a 27-year-old man wanted for ignoring a military recruitment order, according to Spanish news agency Europa Press.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 01:22:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Gaza | Unicef ​​concerned about possible public health crisis</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/21/gaza-unicef-preocupada-com-possivel-crise-de-saude-publica/</link><description>Unicef ​​is concerned about the possibility of a public health crisis in Gaza and children dying from hypothermia, given the catastrophic situation caused by the cold and rain that has been recorded. “The situation in recent days has been really horrible for children here in the Gaza Strip, for several reasons,” said Unicef ​​communications director, Jonathan Crickx, in an interview with the Lusa agency, from the south of the Palestinian enclave.
“There was a storm and there is still very strong rain and winds, which means that all the tents are wet, some of them completely flooded,” he said, adding that the situation affects 750,000 to one million displaced people, most of them people who have already had to move several times and who practically only have what they were wearing when they fled.
“We have many children who only have one or two changes of clothes and are living in makeshift tents, made of plastic or canvas, and the mattresses where they sleep are wet, the clothes are wet, the blankets are wet, the tents are wet”, described Jonathan Crickx.
The situation “is extremely serious”, said the head of Unicef, who is carrying out his fifth aid mission in Gaza. “Children, especially babies, can die from hypothermia”, he highlighted, adding that the temperature at night is around 8º Celsius.
On the other hand, hygiene and sanitation conditions, combined with the fact that many children have suffered from hunger in recent months, make it “very conducive to the spread of water-borne diseases”, he said, admitting that the organization is concerned about the possibility of a public health crisis.
"It's a big concern because families often have to choose between buying soap or buying food. Also because there are not enough bathrooms, not enough toilets, there is a lot of rubbish everywhere because the whole waste management system is not working as efficiently as it used to", explained Jonathan Crickx.
"There are a lot of open sewers, sometimes next to the tents, and, with the water, it floods everything, along with garbage. So, yes, it is very worrying. We are very, very worried about the appearance and spread of water-borne diseases", he reiterated. Although he guarantees that Unicef ​​is working hard to pump out the dirty water and restore the pipes, Jonathan Crickx warned that “there is a lot of work ahead”, because “the level of destruction is immense”.
Given the situation, “a huge effort is needed from the international community”, warned the official. “Even with the ceasefire [in force since October 10], the situation is absolutely dramatic for thousands and thousands of children”, he said, noting that “the ceasefire is far from perfect”.
Insufficient help
Still, Jonathan Crinckx considers that the agreement between Israel and the Islamist group Hamas “brought a little relief to the children” and allowed humanitarian organizations to take more things to the Gaza Strip.
"We managed to bring 250,000 'kits' of warm clothing [each 'kit' consists of a sweater, shoes, a hat and a scarf] to protect children from winter conditions, which is not bad. We also managed to bring tarpaulins, which some people are using to create shelters, in addition to 7,000 tents and around 500,000 to 600,000 blankets", he said.
However, he warned, “this is still not enough because the scale of needs, especially for those families living in tents, is enormous.” On the other hand, there are still items that cannot be taken to Gaza, such as large excavators, heavy machines for removing tons of rubbish and school supplies.
“Notebooks, pencils, rulers and erasers have not been allowed in the Gaza Strip for two years because education is not considered a critical need”, lamented the director of communications at Unicef, noting that education is a latent concern among the population. “I have met many mothers here in Gaza and, as soon as their children's basic needs are met, the first thing they ask is when the schools will reopen,” he reported.
“Education is fundamental and it is very important that children leave the streets and can build a future for themselves”, argued the Unicef ​​official, recalling that “education levels were very good in Gaza before the war”. The Gaza Strip was the target of a polar storm last week that killed at least 11 people, in addition to leaving several others injured and damaging tents and buildings.
The storm caused houses to collapse and damaged dozens of tents used by displaced people. The human rights organization Amnesty International lamented the situation, which it attributed to “Israel's continued restrictions on the entry of essential materials to repair vital infrastructure”, as stated in a statement released this week.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 01:21:10</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korea | President regretted worsening of the crisis with the North</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/21/coreia-do-sul-presidente-lamentou-agravamento-da-crise-com-o-norte/</link><description>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung defended a patient diplomatic approach to North Korea on Friday, acknowledging that the crisis in relations between the two countries has worsened.
In a meeting with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Unification, the South Korean president said that in the past Seoul and Pyongyang pretended to be enemies, but that lately, he stressed, they seem to be turning into “real enemies”.
The head of state's statements came three days after South Korean and North American authorities held a series of discussions in Seoul with the aim of reassessing joint policy towards North Korea. On the other hand, the talks generated internal tensions within the South Korean Executive, according to sources from the official Yonhap news agency.
The Ministry of Unification, responsible for affairs between the two Koreas, objected to the talks led by diplomats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a situation that allegedly constituted a question of jurisdiction. “It seems that this entire current situation stems from political ambitions”, criticized the South Korean President.
For Lee Jae-myung, it is necessary to communicate, dialogue, cooperate and fight for coexistence and prosperity, lamenting what he considered a lack of space for consensus capable of resolving internal tensions in Seoul. In the same statement, the South Korean President emphasized the role of the Ministry of Unification as the main negotiator.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 01:19:44</pubDate></item><item><title>WHO | Indian PM highlights consensus on traditional medicine</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/21/oms-pm-indiano-destaca-consenso-sobre-medicina-tradicional/</link><description>More than 100 countries were represented in New Delhi by politicians, sector professionals and indigenous leaders to discuss the promotion of Traditional Medicine in global health systems. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi closed the second World Health Organization (WHO) Global Summit on Traditional Medicine on Friday by highlighting the “consensus reached on several important issues”.
Modi considered that this consensus reflects “the strength of global partnerships”, according to a statement from his office cited by the Spanish news agency EFE. The head of the Indian government also highlighted that “boosting research, increasing the use of digital technology in traditional medicine and creating reliable regulatory frameworks at a global level will significantly strengthen” this type of medicine.
The summit, with the theme “Restoring Balance for People and the Planet”, began on Wednesday and brought together policymakers, scientists, professionals and indigenous leaders from more than 100 countries in New Delhi, to debate the integration of traditional medicine (TM) into health systems based on scientific criteria.
Science reinforced
According to the summit's online page, participants committed, in the Delhi Declaration on Traditional Medicine, to strengthening the scientific evidence base of TM, expanding investment in research infrastructures and increasing the number of professionals in the field, as well as promoting the WHO World Library of Traditional Medicine, the first of its kind, which was launched during the summit.
The declaration also includes commitments to support “equitable access to safe and effective products through appropriate regulatory mechanisms”, to guarantee their quality and safety, the integration of “safe and effective” MT into national health systems, respecting biodiversity.
Among the agreed actions, aligned with the objectives of the WHO's global strategy for traditional medicine 2025-2034, is also the promotion of the participation of communities and indigenous peoples.
“Member States and partners will translate the Delhi Declaration into time-bound national actions, supported by enhanced international collaboration, sharing of best practices, reporting and collective accountability.”</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 01:18:05</pubDate></item><item><title>China / Ukraine | Meeting of Foreign Affairs representatives</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/21/china-ucrania-encontro-de-representantes-dos-negocios-estrangeiros/</link><description>Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Bin held political consultations between the Chinese and Ukrainian Foreign Ministries with Serhiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's first vice foreign minister, in Beijing on Thursday, the People's Daily reported.

The spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, Chen Binhua, said in a statement yesterday that the so-called National Defense Authorization Act (NDAAA) sends “a wrong signal to the separatist forces” in Taiwan.
He then asked the US to refrain from applying the provisions of the legislative package, signed the day before by Donald Trump, and urged them to “adhere to the one-China principle”. The budget includes funding for the so-called Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative, which covers issues such as medical teams and supply and care capabilities for combat victims.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned again yesterday that any measure to “arm” Taiwan will have “serious consequences”, after the Trump government announced this week an arms sale valued at US$11 billion.
“We urge the US to respect the one-China principle (…), to stop the dangerous measure of arming Taiwan, to stop disturbing peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and to stop sending misleading messages to the separatist forces”, reiterated, in statements to journalists, the Ministry's spokesman, Guo Jiakun.

O pacote também contempla 82 sistemas de foguetes de artilharia de alta mobilidade (M142 HIMARS, na sigla em Inglês) por 4.050 milhões de dólares, e software, equipamento e serviços para redes de missões tácticas, no valor de 1.010 mil milhões de dólares.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 01:15:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Tai Po | Fire death toll rises to 161</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/21/tai-po-numero-de-mortos-no-incendio-sobe-para-161/</link><description>The tragedy that struck the apartment complex in Hong Kong continues to claim victims. The ongoing investigation has already led to the arrest of several people linked to the complex made up of eight 31-story towers
The death toll in the fire at the Wang Fuk Court residential complex in Hong Kong has risen to 161, after another fatal victim was identified through DNA analysis, police authorities announced yesterday. Police Commissioner Joe Chow explained that forensic work is still ongoing and did not exclude the possibility that the final number could undergo further variations as the forensic analysis progresses.
Chow said the identification process remains complex due to the condition of some remains recovered at the site. The authorities' previous report showed 160 fatalities.
The official also said that the dismantling of protective nets and bamboo scaffolding on the facades began on Friday, although, for safety reasons, work is only being carried out in four of the seven affected buildings. The collection of material evidence remains ongoing and there is no scheduled date for completion.
The fire at the Wang Fuk Court residential complex started on November 26, when the netting covering the bamboo structures between the ground and first floors of the Wang Cheong House block caught fire. The fire spread with unusual speed to the rest of the complex, reaching six other towers. Taking into account the magnitude of the tragedy, the local government created an independent commission of inquiry, chaired by a magistrate, with the aim of clarifying the causes of the start and rapid spread of the fire.
This committee should also examine the procedures applied in building rehabilitation contracts, assess the adequacy of the existing regulatory framework, analyze possible criminal liabilities and make recommendations to the Government. The final report must be presented within a maximum period of nine months.
Irregularities and arrests
At the same time, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) detained on Wednesday the current president of the Wang Fuk Court residents' association, as well as his predecessor, as part of the investigation into the catastrophe.
The residential complex, built in 1983 as part of a public affordable housing program, consists of eight 31-storey towers and around two thousand homes. According to the 2021 census, it was home to 4,643 people. Na altura do incêndio, os edifícios estavam envoltos em andaimes de bambu e redes de segurança devido a obras de renovação avaliadas em 330 milhões de dólares de Hong Kong.
Investigações posteriores constataram a utilização de redes sem a resistência ao fogo exigida e de painéis de poliestireno expandido (esferovite) altamente inflamáveis, o que acelerou a propagação do incêndio e levou a suspeitas de cortes indevidos de materiais e falhas nos processos de adjudicação.
Since the beginning of 2024, residents have filed complaints with the ICAC for alleged irregularities. Work began in July and neighbors even posted images of abandoned cigarette butts on social media. Em Setembro, a direcção da associação de moradores foi renovada e o departamento de Trabalho efetuou inspecções com a imposição de sanções. The last official inspection took place a week before the fire.
The Public Prosecutor's Office is also investigating more than a dozen people linked to the fire, under the presumption of having committed negligent homicide, including the directors and an engineering consultant of the construction company responsible for the works.</description><pubDate>2025-12-21 01:13:57</pubDate></item><item><title>Alfredo Gomes Dias, historian, on Rocha Vieira: “A historical figure, whether he wanted to or not”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/20/alfredo-gomes-dias-historiador-sobre-rocha-vieira-uma-figura-historica-quer-quisesse-ou-nao/</link><description>Launched on Thursday in Porto, with the seal of War and Peace, “Macau: The Last Transition – Vasco Rocha Vieira (1991–1999)” is the result of 20 years of work by historian Alfredo Gomes Dias. The work contains personal testimonies from Rocha Vieira and documented details of the last Portuguese Administration of Macau
Another book has just been released about Rocha Vieira and the last Portuguese administration of Macau. Tell me about the beginning of this project.
This project is more or less 20 years old, and began when I met Rocha Vieira, in 2005, to write a text for the book “Governadores de Macau” [published by Livros do Oriente in 2013]. In the midst of this, I discovered that there was a personal document fund of General Rocha Vieira, while governor. As a historian, I was excited by the idea. I offered to do a project with him, which we called a “report”. All the documents were at his home, in Lagoa, where he was from. They were then deposited in a space provided by Mafra City Council and between 2007 and 2013 I worked on this documentation. It was lonely and long work, because I had to organize 1,700 boxes of documentation and combine it with my work as a teacher. Rocha Vieira kept postponing the project, saying no, but in 2016 he told me to move forward with the “report”, the book. I finished the first version in 2021. It is a committed book, in the sense that it aims to give General Rocha Vieira's vision of what his Government was like. This is not an academic work.
He had complete access to the personal file.
He gave me the green light to consult all the documentation, I had no restrictions. Rocha Vieira told me one story or another in detail, gave me guidelines and revealed to me his concerns during his government. He told me some positions he had and then the different paths they took, and the entire book is built around the many conversations I had with the general, in which I also use documentation. We have a vision of everything that happened between 1991 and 1999 and the governor's actions in the different dimensions of the Administration, at an economic, social and political level, in relations with China and Lisbon, with Hong Kong, and then everything related to the work related to the transformation of the territory, such as the birth of Cotai and the major works that were carried out. There is also talk about the transition phase and the major themes, such as the entry of Chinese troops into Macau, the ceremony and how it was organized. Today we live in an immediate world, and at today's speed it's always strange to say that this book took 20 years to make.
Can we say that this is the first time that we have such a complete testimony of Rocha Vieira's vision of his Government?
The edited biography [Vasco Rocha Vieira – Todos os Portos a que Aguei] already gives many ideas about his concerns. What I ended up doing was not focusing so much on the general's entire life, but only on the years of the Government and developing as much as possible many of the issues that Pedro Vieira raised in this biography.
What subjects are then further developed in this new work?
I describe very well all the processes linked to Macau's transition, such as the issue of laws and localization, the need to translate them into Chinese. This was a gigantic job. Then I discuss the construction of major works, the birth of Cotai. All of this based on the original plans and plans designed for Cotai, where the beginning of the idea for this area is known. Any historian who, in the future, wants to study the transition process must necessarily go through this book. I don't want to say that what's there is definitive, because it never is. But it is important to have this basis and testimony, which is enriched and substantiated by documentation.
I imagine that the controversies of the Rocha Vieira Government are also in the book. The quarrel with Jorge Sampaio, the creation of the Fundação Oriente in Portugal. What is Rocha Vieira’s testimony about these two moments?
He always maintained the same speech compared to what he had already said publicly. There is a specific chapter on Fundação Oriente, where, with the support of documentation, an attempt is made to explain the process and why Rocha Vieira, when he arrived in Macau, felt the need to solve a problem that had been dragging on and which was important to overcome. It describes how he managed to resolve it, as it was an issue that was making dialogue with the Chinese authorities difficult. It explains how Rocha Vieira interacted with the different Governments of the [Portuguese] Republic and the different Presidents, the positions he took in order to guarantee what was his responsibility. While he was at the head of the Government, Rocha Vieira always tried to assert his views, and one of the interesting things is that I had access to copies of minutes of meetings of the State Council, in which Rocha Vieira presented his vision on the situation in Macau. It's an interesting contribution. But he explains that the way he spoke with President Mário Soares was completely different from the way he spoke with Jorge Sampaio. The institutional relationship changed, the way of attending a meeting was also different. This is explained, but without going into the personal side of the dispute.
Did Rocha Vieira leave Macau with a feeling of accomplishment?
I think he left Macau very convinced, and the entire transfer ceremony ends up giving us this image that Portugal left in the best possible way. We also have to think that we are talking about two completely different countries, and that one of them is giant. And that, despite this difference, it was possible to maintain an almost equal dialogue between two States to resolve, in the best way, a specific issue that was Macau. What surprised me most about Rocha Vieira's vision was that he changed the centrality of his vision to Macau.
In what sense?
In general, the Portuguese and the authorities spoke of Macau thinking about guaranteeing the transition process without jeopardizing Portugal's interests. And General Rocha Vieira reverses the terms of the issue, that is, to guarantee Macau's interests, with the idea that guaranteeing Macau's interests would be the same as guaranteeing Portugal's interests. It looks like the same thing, but it's not. This vision, for me, was surprising.
Why?
Because it went against what was the most common discourse among the authorities and people responsible for the Portuguese administration [of Macau]. This central idea ends up changing the way he organizes his Government, how he acts and the type of actions he triggers. They all had to do with this deep conviction, that, in the remaining years, a great development of Macau would be guaranteed, the affirmation of Portuguese culture, supporting institutions, or even with the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM), whose solution ended up not being the one he proposed. It turned out to be a minimalist option.
What, specifically, was Rocha Vieira’s position?
It was to ensure that the old Macau High School was the EPM, which would give the school a completely different dimension compared to [the current location]. It has nothing to do with it. He didn't just want a Portuguese school, but also a space where it was possible to develop cultural activities, create a cultural hub in Macau linked to Portugal, and with a much more dignified option than what was, later, the option of the Ministry of Education, in the figure of Marçal Grilo, who chose [the location] of the old Commercial School. Therefore, the focus has always been to guarantee and develop Macau's interests, its autonomy, and the airport issue was fundamental to guarantee Macau's autonomy. It was also intended that Macau would adhere to international agreements regarding respect for human rights. The idea was that, by managing to guarantee Macau's interests, thinking of the territory as part of China's second system, and that if we invested a lot in Macau, we would, naturally, be defending Portuguese interests and leaving a great legacy.
What was the most complex dossier for Rocha Vieira?
I think he had great regrets about the Ministry of Education's option for Portuguese schools. From the conversations I had with him [that's what it seemed to me]. Then there were the security issues, with the sects, which ended up being resolved. The years 1997 and 1998 were very critical moments in Macau, but as it always had good relations with the Chinese authorities, this led to China realizing the situation, starting to collaborate more with the Portuguese authorities in Macau, in order to control the problem.
About Cotai, how did the idea come about?
It arises in the context of the airport works, when it is realized that it would be relatively easy to mobilize the land that was associated with the airport works, taking advantage of that moment to make a connection and create, essentially, a second urban center in Macau. Cotai's initial plans had to do with urban space, green and industrial spaces. The entire plan was designed to bring together different areas, social spaces, such as schools or health, as if Cotai were a mini-city, so to speak, in the territory.
But who actually had the idea?
It was an idea from Rocha Vieira's Executive, developed with secretaries. The idea came from him, when he was faced with the issue of the works, and was then developed with the team. He was always concerned about developing things with the team, also ensuring continuity with what had been done before. When he talked to me, he was careful to say: “this didn't start with me”, or that this or that secretary had been fundamental for a certain job. He never wanted to take credit that wasn't his, and this is also a great recognition from previous governors.
Therefore, Cotai was not supposed to have so much area dedicated to the game.
From what I analyzed in the documents, there was no idea of ​​giving up such a large space for entertainment, with casinos. I think the initial vision for Cotai was a little more balanced, with housing, schools, health centers, green spaces. It was supposed to be a new urban space that would be created with all the services necessary to function, it wasn't just supposed to be games.
The moments in which Rocha Vieira clutches the flag to his chest, moved, will go down in history. Did he remember those moments with you?
Yes, but despite the historical dimension of his role, Rocha Vieira was not exactly aware of the historical role he was playing. He was there with a clear mission and objectives, without really thinking about the role he could have in the future. Once, when we were having lunch, I told him that we could put our work into perspective, but that he was going to become a historical figure in the history of Portugal, whether he wanted to or not. And the funny thing is that he looked at me with a face like he had never thought of that, with a very surprised look. In fact, it is unthinkable to take away his status as the last Portuguese governor in Macau in hundreds of years of history. On top of that, he was there for a long period [9 years], when most governors were there for three or four years.</description><pubDate>2025-12-20 04:01:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Christian Montag, UM Institute for Collaborative Innovation: “AI cannot imitate the human touch”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/christian-montag-instituto-de-inovacao-colaborativa-da-um-a-ia-nao-consegue-imitar-o-toque-humano/</link><description>Can artificial intelligence help combat loneliness? The issue was analyzed in a study by the University of Macau, led by academic Christian Montag. The director of the Institute for Collaborative Innovation emphasizes that AI tools “are not long-term solutions” on a psychological level
How can artificial intelligence (AI) help overcome feelings of loneliness, if social networks cannot achieve this goal?
The “needs and gratifications theory” states that technology can only be successful if its use satisfies human needs, such as, for example, the need for social interaction. With AI companions, whether as stand-alone products or integrated into social media platforms, we have reached a new level, because human beings start talking to an artificial person and not with another human person, as happens on social media. Specific problems arise with these new AI companions, in that there are overly pleasant and charming AI systems that do not challenge a person's biased views of the world. Furthermore, many people around the world have become overly dependent on these products, using them without critical reflection.
One of the conclusions of your study is that AI cannot, on its own, resolve feelings of loneliness. What steps in the investigation were followed to reach this conclusion?
There are well-conducted studies that show that interactions with AI companions can actually reduce feelings of loneliness. We do not doubt these results nor deny the potential that can arise from these interactions between humans and AI, as long as such systems are designed safely and when a human is not available. That said, we believe that these interactions between humans and AI do not represent a long-term solution.
Why?
This is due to the absence of social contact and the real presence of another human being when turning to AI companions based on large-scale language models, especially in moments of desperation. We have reviewed a vast literature that demonstrates that we need to take our evolutionary heritage seriously, with the real need for other human beings, particularly in the age of AI. Our perspective is based on many years of research in the area of ​​affective neuroscience. Still, it is clearly necessary to develop more new empirical studies that directly address interactions with AI and support this vision.
We run the risk of AI causing profound cognitive changes in people. To what extent? Can we change as human beings, especially when it comes to our need for others?
The same discussion arose with the appearance of smartphones. It is important to note that this oldest discussion has not yet been resolved: what happens or happened to our cognitive abilities when we began to permanently outsource the learning of telephone numbers, the guidance from A to B, among other tasks, to a machine? Recent research from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] suggests that the brain is less activated when using ChatGPT for writing tasks, compared to writing without such support. To me, this is not surprising and should not lead to moral panics. We have other more urgent problems, such as when real difficulties arise when inequalities in society increase, this is because some people use AI and others do not invest in this area.
What are the concrete impacts?
Some people may soon become very, very productive, while those who are not educated to use AI properly will not be able to keep up. Interestingly, we have observed in recent research that people with a deep learning style are more willing to engage with AI to become more productive. As for the question of whether we have changed in relation to our need for others, I highly doubt that, as these evolutionary impulses are genetically anchored in our species and we cannot simply eliminate them. Social needs are an essential part of what it means to be human.
Could these cognitive changes, if they occur, be more significant in young people than in adults, for example?
Interesting question. We know, from some studies on attitudes towards AI, that younger users tend to have more positive views about AI and, therefore, are more likely to adopt it in their daily lives. However, we are currently observing something quite problematic, such as the fact that AI is often eliminating jobs for young people just leaving university. Thus, AI appears to make it more difficult to enter the job market after obtaining a university degree. In other words, a lack of work experience makes things difficult for many young people. In the end, this could also lead to young people's perception of AI becoming more negative soon.
How should governments legislate or adopt policies to promote healthy acceptance and use of AI in society and schools?
We see very different approaches around the world to respond to the AI ​​revolution. I am German and, in Europe, we are seeing strong regulatory efforts with the so-called Artificial Intelligence Regulation (Artificial Intelligence Act). Personally, I am not convinced that the current European regulatory scheme is well planned, as I think it is too strict and, in some points, uses legally undefined terms, although I applaud the aim of promoting reliable AI and trying to reduce harm. I think the current regulation of AI in the European Union could go too far and end up harming the European economy by stifling much-needed innovation. But there are real dangers associated with AI and some regulation is needed.
What dangers?
I'm talking, for example, about the unregulated fusion between biotechnology and AI that could result in harm if people start to “create” new viruses in their backyards. I find Singapore's approach based on lifelong learning as a response to the AI ​​revolution very interesting. The Singapore Government offers its citizens the possibility of obtaining an academic degree in AI from the age of 40, with financial support from the State itself. What I like about this approach is that we need to remind people that it is also their responsibility to acquire new skills throughout their lives. This mentality must be instilled from an early age in schools.
In what areas of our lives can large-scale language models (LLMs) do more good than harm?
There are many routine and repetitive tasks where AI will be really useful to humans. However, we know from scientific literature that humans experience what is called “algorithm aversion”: in some areas of our lives, people do not like AI playing a role. For example, when we talk about couples therapy, people clearly prefer to talk to a human being than an AI system. Perhaps the closer we come to our evolutionary heritage in terms of caring for each other, the more the role of AI must be carefully monitored and reflected upon if we want it to have a place there. Personally, I wouldn't want to see my child being taken care of in kindergarten by an AI-powered robot.
How should psychology adapt to AI, given the growing number of people using it for this purpose?
There are different perspectives on this topic. Firstly, not everyone knows that psychology is a discipline that relies heavily on data. Therefore, psychology students are trained to become excellent data scientists. In this context, it is logical that our discipline adopts AI as a data analysis tool. However, I think it speaks to how psychologists view the increasing use of AI in human relationships. As with many things, this is complex. If AI enables better human communication, such as improving hearing aids for people with hearing problems, that is very welcome. If AI replaces human relationships, from my perspective it will cause problems. As we exposed in our most recent work, AI cannot currently successfully imitate human social touch or the real presence of another person.
At the Center for Cognitive and Brain Science at the University of Macau, what are the main projects developed in this area?
We have unique research opportunities at the University of Macau to study interactions between humans and AI, using neuroscientific techniques. I hope we can publish very interesting discoveries in the near future.
Humanity still lives here
Recently published in the scientific journal “Trends and Cognitive Sciences”, the article “Can AI really help solve the loneliness epidemic?” [Can AI Really Help Solve the Loneliness Epidemic?] counts Christian Montag, associate director of the Institute for Collaborative Innovation at the University of Macau (UM) as lead author, followed by academics Michiel Spapé, associate professor at the Center for Cognitive and Brain Sciences at UM, and Benjamin Becker, professor at the Department of Psychology at the University of Hong Kong, as co-authors.
According to a press release released by UM regarding this investigation, one of the main conclusions is that AI “will probably not be a long-term solution to human loneliness”. Quoted in this note, Christian Montag stated that “if a person is lonely, they long for the physical presence of someone close to them”, and this “is very difficult to imitate with the available chatbots”.
"The major language models operate primarily through text communication. Clearly, this is not enough to provide lonely people with the best cure for loneliness: direct in-person support," he stated. According to the World Health Organization, “loneliness affects one in six people worldwide”, having been “identified as a global public health concern”.
Despite the sign, the study points to a positive side of this universe, noting that “AI technology has significant potential to support human beings in moments of psychological crisis, especially when human intervention is not available”. However, “the researchers argue that the technology must be made safer before it can be used in this context”, emphasizing “the importance of remembering our evolutionary heritage and the need for genuine interpersonal connections”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-17 01:04:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Luís Bernardino, academic: “We need to define a defense cooperation strategy” for the CPLP</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/25/luis-bernardino-academico-precisamos-definir-uma-estrategia-de-cooperacao-defesa-para-a-cplp/</link><description>The book “25 Years of Defense Cooperation at CPLP” was released in 2023 in digital format and, two years later, reached the printed version. Luís Bernardino, co-author linked to the Universidade Autónoma de Lisboa, highlights positive developments since the creation of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, despite inaction and controversies with Equatorial Guinea
“25 Years of Defense Cooperation in the CPLP [Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries]” was released as an e-book and is now available in print. Why edit this book?
This book talks about the 25 years of cooperation in the CPLP defense area and is written by me, together with a colleague from Brazil, Camila Rizzi. It results from a research project developed at the CPLP Strategic Analysis Center, based in Mozambique. It has the CPLP defense component and makes strategic reflection on this topic. Due to the fact that 25 years of cooperation have passed in this area, we wanted to carry out an evaluation and the book so that it would remain in the history of the organization. In 2023, there were no financial conditions to publish the book on paper as we wanted, and it was now launched on November 18th, in Maputo.
There is criticism regarding the effective action of the CPLP. Do you consider that this organism has grown sustainably?
The assessment I make is in the area of ​​defense. When the CPLP was created, cooperation in the area of ​​defense was not included in the initial six areas. This area only emerged in 1998. The CPLP was born with six main areas – culture, language, political-diplomatic concentration – and currently has 26 areas of cooperation, which is proof that it has grown in a sustained manner. Obviously, with ups and downs, situations have become easier over these almost 30 years. But what stands out in this book, in the area of ​​defense, is that there was a very consolidated and participated growth. In these 25 years, a lot of interesting things have been done and the evaluation is positive.
And the future?
We need to define a defense cooperation strategy and what we want for the CPLP in this area over the next 25 years. This is the challenge we face, of greater activity and initiative, so that cooperation and defense can be strategic in what is cooperation within States. So that it can be more visible and effectively allow for growth, participation and development, or even greater commitment, in regional contexts.
But looking at the past, present and future, what has the dynamic been like in the defense area?
The book shows a certain dynamic of substantial constitutional growth in the first phase. Then there were very interesting developments, with some protocols and cooperation at the level of the Armed Forces, but there is still a lot to do, namely looking at the area of ​​defense cooperation as a strategic area.
The global geopolitical system appears to be changing very quickly, following a multipolar path. Should the CPLP have another role in this context, with actors such as China, Russia or the United States?
The CPLP is not a multilateral instrument, it is not an organization of that level. We have to place the CPLP at the level of the Commonwealth, for example, of organizations at a cultural, linguistic level, of partnership between countries, of concern for development. What I usually say is that the CPLP is a good diplomatic communication instrument, a soft power in areas related to conflict management and prevention. Let us not expect there to be armed forces, or an army, from the CPLP. This body is one of dialogue and cooperation. What we do, in terms of defense, is exactly that, create partnerships so that there are mechanisms for responding to disasters, to provide training capacity for the armed forces. There are even those who ask the question: why did the CPLP not intervene in Cabo Delgado, in Mozambique, on the issue of terrorism?
And why?
Because the CPLP is not a hard power mechanism, it has no capacity, doctrine, logistics, mandate or viability to be used in combat operations. And CPLP Member States are very aware that we are a very good mechanism for cooperation, partnership and development, with contributions to culture and language. Therefore, the CPLP will not intervene in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, because that is not its area, nor does it have mechanisms for this dynamic.
Is the existence of the CPLP justified?
I think so, obviously, because, as I said, the CPLP is a very good instrument in terms of cooperation, the dissemination of the Portuguese language, of history. The fact is that we have around 350 million people who speak Portuguese. We have 30 countries that are associated observers, such as Ukraine, Chile, and Portuguese culture is represented in this organization. Each country has what it wants from the CPLP and gives it the importance it thinks it should give, and this depends on the foreign policy of each State. But I think the CPLP makes a lot of sense in the world we live in, and does so as a multilateral representative of language, culture, cooperation between Portuguese-speaking states, and those that ultimately have some affinity [with the Portuguese-speaking world]. The Macau issue is very specific to this organization.
Macau has the role of a commercial platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, and China has an agenda for Lusophony.
Before 1999 Macau had its own status within the CPLP, as it was administered by Portuguese. There was a Joint Declaration that allowed Macau, not being a Member State, to have, in a certain way, a protocol [with the CPLP]. When it became a Macao SAR, things changed and it lost that connection status, and Macau is not a member of the CPLP, and obviously cannot be. Neither does China, and it cannot be. Therefore, there is an associated observer status here that arises for countries, international and regional organizations, and even territorial entities with their own administration, which is also not quite the case in Macau. The territory is in limbo, between having a very strong history linked to Lusofonia, and having an administration very linked to China, which gives it, in my perspective, two dynamics.
In what sense?
Macau is a fundamental element in the connection between the CPLP countries and China. For all reasons, but due to the issue of language, history, and its representation, it is a fundamental actor in this cooperation. Macau must effectively be seen as a partner and as a gateway for China to Portuguese-speaking countries. This is what, in a way, is already happening, and this is what the CPLP will be paying attention to, in this relationship in which Macau has a special status. Whether we like it or not, it has an impact. Macau is an attractive factor in facilitating relations between China and Angola, Portugal or Brazil.
Does Equatorial Guinea's stay in the CPLP raise questions of credibility?
I agree with you. In these 30 years, it has been one of the main difficult moments in creating consensus. I remember that Equatorial Guinea was admitted in 2014, but there was already a process in the previous analysis phase. There was always an extension, year after year, and it was difficult to reach a consensus within the CPLP countries. In 2014, there was a summit in Timor-Leste and, through the action of Brazil and Angola, there was, in a way, a lot of pressure for Equatorial Guinea to join. But there are two principles, for better and for worse, that justify Equatorial Guinea's presence in the CPLP.
What are…
The first argument is that, in fact, Equatorial Guinea has Portuguese as its official language in its Constitution, despite us knowing that the Portuguese language, for example, covers four or five percent of society as a whole, and I am already being quite generous. But there is a commitment from the Equatorial Guinea authorities to develop Portuguese as a working language and there is a historical connection to Portuguese culture and Lusophony. Another criterion is the promise that, in the next constitutional review, a commitment will be made to abolish the death penalty. As for Portuguese, it's something that takes generations, it's not done from one year to the next. Not even in the next 10 or 15 years will we have Portuguese perfectly implemented. There is some shyness, a commitment, in a way. As for the death penalty, the fact is that, it seems, some change has been achieved. There has never been a death penalty action again [since accession]. And there is hope that, in the next constitutional review, this fact will be abolished from the Constitution and that it may, effectively, cease to exist. As a member of the CPLP, these changes will be easier and more visible and, in the future, Equatorial Guinea can effectively assume CPLP status taking these premises into account. I don't know if it will happen, I leave here a reluctance, and this is a challenging moment for the CPLP itself. Work needs to be done from within, so that Equatorial Guinea can be at the same level as other countries, especially in these two areas.
What is certain is that there remains a certain lack of transparency regarding what is happening in the country.
We are aware that Equatorial Guinea has major problems with issues of democratic legitimacy and elections. There are a series of situations that we recognize are not perfectly adequate given the status of CPLP countries. I think there is hope that things can change, an attempt to create space for Portuguese to grow within Equatorial Guinea, and also a commitment to greater openness and participation. What is a fact is that Equatorial Guinea has participated in CPLP meetings, and I have participated in some. In international situations we have to be pragmatic, and we hope that, just because Equatorial Guinea is in the CPLP, this can help Guinea itself to develop some mechanical gestures.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Timor-Leste / Independence – Mari Alkatiri: Proclamation was anticipated by the Indonesian military presence</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/24/timor-leste-independencia-mari-alkatiri-proclamacao-foi-antecipada-pela-presenca-militar-indonesia/</link><description>Interview by Isabel Marisa Serafim, from the Lusa agency
The leader of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin), Mari Alkatiri, said that the unilateral proclamation of independence was scheduled for December 1, 1975, but was brought forward because Indonesian troops were already in the territory.
“It was initially scheduled for December 1st”, said Mari Alkatiri, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which is marked on Friday, and of the Indonesian occupation, nine days later, on December 7th.
In November, Mari Alkatiri went on a “safari” through several African countries, mainly the Portuguese-speaking African Countries (PALOP), which involved participating in the declaration of Angola’s independence on November 11, 1975.
"After this 'tour', this African 'safari', I returned to the country. At the time I was in Maputo to prepare my return and I received a call from Nicolau Lobato not to return, because we needed to have someone outside the country", he recalled, highlighting that he did not follow the order from the then vice-president of Fretilin.
“So I returned to Dili on the 22nd or 23rd of November and the central committee and military political committee were meeting at the current headquarters of the National Police of Timor-Leste, which was the provisional headquarters of Fretilin, and the proclamation for December 1st was being discussed”, he explained. On November 28, Mari Alkatiri, then 25 years old, recalled that Nicolau Lobato came to her house and said that it was necessary to proclaim independence that day.
"We both left in his car for Lahane where Xavier do Amaral [former president of Fretilin] was and we conveyed this to Xavier Amaral, who clearly said to wait another three or four days. We said there was no time to wait and we decided to make the proclamation that day in the afternoon", he said.
"Fortunately, not only was the Constitution ready, but also the flag was ready. It was my mother who sewed the flag. There were minimum conditions for the proclamation of independence", stated the current secretary general of Fretilin, who also wrote the text of the proclamation.
“When I start talking about these days it’s not just memory, I actively participated in the unilateral proclamation of independence, although people try to cut out my photo, politics, but the truth is that there is only one person still alive who actively participated in the proclamation 50 years ago, that’s me”, he highlighted.
In the first Timorese Government, led by Nicolau Lobato and which only lasted nine days, Mari Alkatiri was appointed Minister of State for Political Affairs. Nocolau Lobato led the fight against the Indonesian occupation and was assassinated in December 1978. The restoration of independence took place on May 20, 2002, after a referendum for self-determination on August 30, 1999 and 24 years of resistance against Indonesia.
A question of egos
Mari Alkatiri also stated, in the same interview, that “egos” are preventing Timor-Leste from overcoming the challenges and that a more democratic, inclusive and comprehensive leadership culture is needed.
"If we managed it at the time, with all the difficulties, with all the challenges to overcome, at almost the speed of light, why can't we today? That's the question, the question of the cause. When the cause unites, the journey can go on, with many setbacks here and there, but we will succeed and we will win", said Mari Alkatiri in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which marks this Friday.
Asked about the reason for no union, the leader of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin) ​​said it was “egos”.
“I am following the budget debate, when we continue to think about State matters in a 'cantin' way, we are not going anywhere”, criticized the former East Timorese Prime Minister, whose party chose to abstain in the final global vote on the State Budget.
Regarding criticism of the current government's options, Mari Alkatiri said she did not know if there was ever an option. “Estratégia não vejo. Há uns acertos aqui e acolá, tenta aqui e acolá, mas não há estratégia, mas defende-se bastante o planeamento estratégico, investimento estratégico, mas não vejo”, afirmou.
“There is a need for a much more democratic, much more inclusive, very comprehensive leadership culture, with a sense of mission and vision for the future”, highlighted the secretary general of Fretilin. The party leader also warned not to wait for the “bomb to explode”.
“The delay bomb is there, the time bomb is there, I hope we don’t have to, after that, apologize for the truth, after the bomb goes off”, he highlighted. Asked if the “bomb” is dissatisfaction, the former prime minister said: “complete”.
"A country that after 24 years of restoring independence, with the means it had to work, why did it fail? Lack of sense of inclusion. We are building a State, we talk about the Democratic Rule of Law, is that true? Or oligarchic", he asked.
The new generations
Still in relation to young people, who represent the majority of the approximately 1.4 million inhabitants of Timor-Leste, Mari Alkatiri said that they feel lost. "Young people are naturally more generous when they are more considered, or more rebellious, when they are revolted. There are two facets here in youth, one of generosity when they embrace a cause, the other is a much more violent reaction of confrontation", he said.
Pointing out that more than 70% of the population is under 35 years old, Mari Alkatiri warned that those “two generations have already been sacrificed” due to “poor quality” education and “increasingly worse health” and “no prospects”. “Now, we all say that oil money will run out, I see that for the Government, the alternative to oil is oil”, he said.
In September, the capital of the Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund was US$18.95 billion (€16.4 billion). “We kept dreaming about Sunrise and as I usually say while we dream about Sunrise, we will have the ‘sunset’, because there is no politics, there are no plans, there are no programs”, he added.
Mari Alkatiri was referring to the Greater Sunrise gas field, located 150 kilometers from Timor-Leste and 450 kilometers from Darwin, whose project has been mired in an impasse, with Dili defending the construction of a gas pipeline to the south of the country, and Woodside, the consortium's second largest partner, leaning towards a connection to the existing unit in Darwin.
The consortium is made up of the Timorese company Timor Gap (56.56%), the operator Woodside Energy (33.44%) and Osaca Gás (10.00%). The Government of Timor-Leste announced on Saturday the signing of a cooperation agreement with the Australian Woodside Energy for studies to process and export gas to the country.
Missing discussions
The secretary general of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin), Mari Alkatiri, defended the need for “all together” to discuss what failed in the last 24 years, after the restoration of independence in May 2002.
"There is a lot of talk about new paradigms and the old paradigm, we are ready to sit down together to discuss the old paradigm, why did it fail? No", said the former Timorese prime minister, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which marks this Friday.
For Mari Alkatiri, everyone contributed with “their positive part, with their negative part”, but it is necessary to understand the failures in “individual terms”, in “collective terms” and there be “responsibility”. Asked by Lusa about the reasons why there is no such discussion, the leader of the Timorese opposition replied that a “leader who cannot sit at the table is not a leader”.
"The leader must know that there is a time to sit at the table. I made proposals. When I returned in 2018, I said 'my vote is so that the people can win', I didn't tell Fretilin to win. The message was clear, it was time for us all to think together. I ran the campaign saying Fretilin wins, Xanana wins", stated Mari Alkatiri.
The Fretilin leader said the response has been “revenge, hate”. "In such a way that to take revenge on me, it affects hundreds of people, families. If it's me, come and talk to me, you don't have to harm others, but this is a specific issue", he stated, referring to the Timorese Prime Minister, XAnana Gusmão. The fundamental issue, continued Maria Alkatiri, is “to have a sense of mission, a vision of the future and to have a common cause”.
"What is crucial is knowing all the money that was spent, what was done. A balance of collective and individual performance. When we were waging war, we knew what we wanted, to restore independence, 24 years after the restoration of independence we don't know where we are going", lamented the leader.
Mari Alkatiri also said he was “very concerned” about the report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which warned on September 11 of the proliferation of criminal networks in Oecussi, a Timorese enclave on the Indonesian side of the island of Timor, highlighting that recent investigations show contamination of the region.
"It is already being absorbed by the mafia cartel, who are coming here in all their strength. We have closed kiosks and we think we are fighting the mafia. I am very worried," he said. For the future, Mari Alkatiri stated that he will continue to fight, but to “create critical mass”.
"My fight now is not the concern with electoral cycles, but how I can actually create a true critical mass in Timor-Leste. Let's end blindness, many of our academic intellectuals get pregnant through their ears, but they don't get pregnant", he highlighted.
The Fretilin leader also told everyone in his generation that it is time to put “egos” aside and start “thinking together”, highlighting that they have another five years to do so. “The next term of governance must be the product of understanding if we really want this country to move forward”, stated Mari Alkatiri, highlighting that the Timorese people deserve “much more and much better” than what has been given to date.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 17:33:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist activist, 34 years old, physical engineer, Romani national. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied the right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on staying, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (still in 2011 the Municipal Council of Faro wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
The gentlemen we are talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. These speeches have been adopted and delivered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by various representatives of the center-right, conservatives, center-left, liberals, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. Há muita coisa que – como pessoas que querem um mundo melhor – temos de fazer, nomeadamente trabalhar para criminalizar o discurso de ódio; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. E precisamos de mais.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | Unanimidade quanto à “Super Pole” nos GT</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/gp-unanimidade-quanto-a-super-pole-nos-gt/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) should continue to focus on the “Super Pole” system for the ninth FIA GT World Cup, if this race is once again included in the program of the 73rd Macau Grand Prix next year
Pela primeira vez, na edição do passado mês de Novembro, os dez mais rápidos da Qualificação 1 dispuseram de 20 minutos para se prepararem para a primeira “Super Pole” da história da Taça do Mundo de GT da FIA, na qual, pela ordem inversa dos tempos, cada piloto entrou sozinho em pista para uma volta de saída, duas voltas cronometradas e uma de regresso, com intervalos de um minuto entre concorrentes e a possibilidade de utilizar um novo jogo de pneus. O melhor tempo obtido entre as duas voltas cronometradas determinou a Qualificação 2 “Super Pole”, que definiu a grelha de partida da Corrida Classificativa.
Após o sucesso desta iniciativa, a federação internacional pretende continuar a aplicá-la na Taça GT Macau – Taça do Mundo FIA de GT, tendo inclusive produzido um vídeo promocional para o confirmar. Lutz Leif Linden, Presidente da Comissão de GT e da Comissão de Construtores da FIA, admite que se trata de algo “muito excitante para os espectadores, assim como para os pilotos”.
Presente em Macau durante o Grande Prémio, o influente Stéphane Ratel, CEO da SRO Motorsports Group, entidade co-organizadora da Taça GT Macau – Taça do Mundo FIA de GT, concorda igualmente com a medida, sublinhando que representa “um desafio adicional e que resulta. Na SRO fazemos isso a nível global. Nos maiores eventos, como as 24 Horas de Spa, temos uma ‘Super Pole’, e é algo de que gostamos.”
Riders and brands agree
Drivers and brands were equally impressed with this first experience on the territory's streets. “Macau is already special and I think that, with this format, we had something even more special”, recalled Antonio Fuoco, the driver who gave Ferrari its first in Macau since 1995.
Ferdinando Cannizzo, head of Ferrari's Competizioni GT, reinforces the idea, highlighting the technical advantage when the challenge comes down to the driver and the circuit, without external interference. “Without cars, without traffic, you can really focus on your strengths and try to maximize the car’s performance”, said the Cavallino Rampante brand representative.
This qualification system, an important moment of the weekend given the difficulty of overtaking on the Guia Circuit, also adds an element of uncertainty and elevates the spectacle. Stefan Gugger, responsible for the development of Lamborghini's competition cars, said that, in his opinion, "it's an improvement for our fans. We can really see the performance of the driver and the car, which also represents a good challenge for the team."
Porsche, one of the brands that most advocated the mandatory introduction of expensive torque sensors in this race, was also one of the main drivers of the “Super Pole”. “I believe the new format is a real step forward,” said Thomas Laudenbach, Vice President of Porsche Motorsport. "It allows the drivers to have clean laps. It's a great step in the right direction, maybe with some tuning, but overall for me it's positive. I hope they maintain this format because it's fantastic."
Entretanto, a data da edição de 2026 do Grande Prémio de Macau deverá ser confirmada na próxima semana, durante o Conselho Mundial da FIA, que terá lugar antes da cerimónia de entrega dos prémios da FIA referentes a 2025, na cidade de Tashkent, no Uzbequistão.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:52:45</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA will continue to invest in Formula Regional in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/24/gp-fia-vai-continuar-a-apostar-na-formula-regional-em-macau/</link><description>The fact that the FIA ​​switched from Formula 3 to Formula Regional (FR) continues to be a recurring theme when the topic is the Macau Grand Prix. Although the show's premier race did not disappoint in this year's edition, somewhat erasing the bad image left last year, there is still a widespread feeling that the international federation deprived the Grand Prix of its favorite race.
At the end of the 72nd edition, the Coordinator of the Organizing Committee of the Macau Grand Prix, Lei Si Leng, when questioned again by the local press about a possible return of Formula 3, stated that the organization will continue to cooperate with the FIA ​​to choose the races that best suit Macau. At the same time, the director of the Macau Sports Institute left the guarantee that the plan involves continuing to receive drivers of training age and who assert themselves as the future of motorsport.
“We have been communicating closely with the FIA ​​to find out which races can be held in Macau and the FIA ​​has selected the best drivers to come and compete here”, he said, adding that he hopes “that the best drivers can come to Macau and that we continue to collaborate with the FIA ​​to organize the most suitable races for Macau”.
On the FIA ​​side, there is the conviction that FR is the discipline that best adapts to the characteristics of the Guia Circuit, a layout that remains practically unchanged after seven decades of existence. The discontent that still exists is considered natural. “Motor sport is traditional, and I don't remember any change that was well received at the beginning, even good changes” admitted Emanuele Pirro, the current president of the FIA ​​Single Seater Commission, in conversation with journalists in Macau.
The former Italian driver, a connoisseur of the Guia Circuit and winner of the Guia Race with BMW, took advantage of his time in the Macao SAR to remember that “if we look at the history of Macau, it started with Formula 2, or Formula Pacific, and then moved on to Formula 3. In 1984, a journalist could have asked: 'why don't we race in Formula 2 anymore?' I think it's inevitable. Everything has a price. For us to have the privilege of having a circuit that has remained unchanged since Throughout its history, the price to pay is to use cars that continue to be reasonably safe. And I think Formula Regional offers a good balance in terms of speed.”
In a rare interview with the specialized magazine INSIDE, the former coordinator of the Grand Prix, José Manuel Costa Antunes, warned against letting the level of the race drop. "Today, with the transition to Formula Regional and Formula 4, which is not a problem, they are just different cars, we see more inexperienced drivers", said the man who was at the helm of the event for the longest time, touching on a sensitive topic: "Some people can simply buy a seat. That is worrying. As fans, we want real races, not red flags. We owe it to the history of the Grand Prix to recover that selection process, to ensure that only the best compete here."
Numbers support the decision
Looking at the time sheets, it can be concluded that the records for the main FR race were around 2m16s, around ten seconds slower than the times recorded in the last year of the FIA F3 single-seaters, in 2023. In historical terms, these times place the FR cars on a level similar to that of the Formula 3 cars of the late 1990s. However, from a safety point of view, the speeds reached in the “Sprint” for Curva Lisboa continues to be the main concern since Sophia Flörsch’s accident in 2018. With the suction cone, speeds above 290 km/h were common in 2023 with the Dallara F3, but the change to FR cars reduced these values to around 260 km/h.
In 2026, the new Formula Regional car, the Tatuus T-326, is expected to arrive in Macau, which is equipped with a three-cylinder, 1.6-liter Toyota ATM163T engine, prepared by Autotecnica Motori, which is more powerful and efficient. The chassis was designed according to the latest FIA specifications, in order to provide improvements in terms of performance, safety and aerodynamics, facilitating overtaking and promoting more lively racing. However, although lap times are expected to drop again, top speeds will probably not be dramatically higher.
It should be noted that the change to FR was not motivated solely by security concerns. When the FIA ​​granted Formula One Management (FOM) the commercial and promotional rights for Formula 3, the territory's race became a non-championship race of an international competition, limited to the participation of the same teams that competed in the championship. This change was received unfavorably by the promoter himself, as he never played a truly intervening role within the Grand Prix. Furthermore, holding the race in Macau, in November, involved particularly demanding logistics, with a negative impact on the planning and execution of pre-season tests.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 05:37:32</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Date and two competitions confirmed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/12/gp-data-e-duas-competicoes-confirmadas/</link><description>The final meeting of the 2025 FIA World Motor Sport Council took place last Wednesday, during FIA General Assembly Week, in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The session was attended by delegates from the various National Sports Authorities (ASNs), from which important decisions were taken, some of which concern Macau
The date of the 73rd Macau Grand Prix has been officially revealed, confirming that the Macao SAR's biggest annual sporting event will take place from 19 to 22 November next year. The international federation also took the opportunity to announce that the date and location of the ninth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup, which has been contested at the Guia Circuit since its creation, as part of the Grand Prix program, have been approved by the GT Commission. The same entity did not reveal the guidelines for next year's race, which in this year's edition only featured sixteen competitors, but this is the first time it has confirmed it so early.
For its part, the Touring Car Commission confirmed the calendar for the next season of the Kumho TCR World Tour, which will once again end at the Guia Circuit, as in previous years. China's strong presence on the calendar stands out: the Macau and Zhuzhou races are joined by an absolute debut, the new Chengdu Tianfu International Circuit. With eight events – one in Mexico and three in Europe, including the visit to the Vila Real International Circuit -, Asia gains new importance with a total of four rounds.
Four of the 2026 Kumho TCR World Tour events will maintain the traditional two-race format, including Macau, while the remaining four – Mexico, Spain (Valencia), South Korea (Inje) and China (Chengdu) – will adopt the three-race-per-weekend format introduced last year, reaching a total of twenty races in the season.
O Conselho Mundial do Desporto Motorizado da FIA não se pronunciou publicamente sobre a continuidade, ou não, das Taças do Mundo de Fórmula Regional (FR) e Fórmula 4 no programa do Grande Prémio de Macau, ainda que o projecto desta última, que envolve igualmente o promotor chinês Mintime e a Fédération Française du Sport Automobile (FFSA), tenha sido concebido para três anos.
Also bet on karting
The World Council also approved the regulations that support the expansion of Karting under the supervision of the FIA, at a time when the next phase of implementation of the “Global Karting Plan” begins, which, next year, will integrate new “Arrive &amp; Drive” championships, included in one of the most extensive calendars ever.
Following the auspicious start of the FIA ​​“Arrive &amp; Drive” Karting World Cup, held in Malaysia last month, the innovative format will be expanded with new continental championships, bringing these accessible and affordable events closer to communities around the world. The 2026 calendar, already approved, will feature a European Championship and an Asia-Pacific Championship, each consisting of three rounds, the winners of which will secure a place on the 2026 FIA “Arrive &amp; Drive” Karting World Cup grid, to be contested at the end of the season.
The Coloane Kart Track, still one of the most modern in Southeast Asia, will be part of this first edition of the “Arrive &amp; Drive” Asia-Pacific Championship, hosting the inaugural race on the weekend of June 20th and 21st. The calendar of this low-cost competition also includes two other stages: one in Zhuzhou, in Hunan Province, and another in Madras, India.</description><pubDate>2025-12-12 01:19:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau | Rosa Mota in second place in the minimarathon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/09/macau-rosa-mota-em-segundo-lugar-na-minimaratona/</link><description>The Portuguese Rosa Mota came second on Sunday in the Macau mini-marathon, a 4.5-kilometer race that is part of the International Marathon in the Chinese region. The 67-year-old former Olympic champion finished the race in 17 minutes and 10 seconds, 54 seconds more than the first, local athlete Kin I Chao.
In February, the Portuguese woman was discharged from hospital, following a planned surgical intervention, after overcoming a “serious problem”, a “dissecting aortic aneurysm”. Rosa Mota, born in Porto, was Olympic marathon champion at the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988, after having won bronze in Los Angeles in 1984. Her achievements also include three European titles (1982, 1986 and 1990) and one world title (1987).
She is still the national marathon record holder, with a time of 02.23.29 hours, a mark achieved in Chicago in 1985. In recent years, Rosa Mota had reappeared at the highest level and won several veteran races, having set in Barcelona, ​​in 2024, the world half-marathon record (1:24.27 hours), for the 65 to 69 age group.
Also last year, the Portuguese won the Macau mini-marathon, repeating the triumphs in 2018, 2019 and 2023. This year, the organization invited several athletes, nominated by the Association of Portuguese Language Olympic Committees (ACOLOP), from Portugal, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sri Lanka and the state of Goa (India).
Lusophony highlighted
Portuguese speakers were in the spotlight in the half-marathon, with Cape Verdean Samuel Freire, from Sporting Clube de Portugal, finishing third in the men's race, behind winner Martin Ndungu and David Kipkorir Rono, both Kenyans.
In fourth place came the Portuguese Fábio Oliveira, 30th in the marathon of the first edition of the European Road Championships, in April, and part of the Portugal team that finished in fourth place. Soon after came the young Mozambican Pinto Victor Jequecene, aged 22, while Angolan David Jundo Elias finished in seventh place.
In the women's race, Angolan Lúcia Kawele Capingala came in third place, behind the winner, Kenyan Lucy Ndambuki, and Chinese Na Zhao. Already off the podium, in fourth position, finished the young Portuguese Joana Ferreira, who won the silver medal in the under-23 race of the national athletics championships in 10 thousand meters, in May.
Mozambican Domingas Ernesto Checane came in sixth place. Around 12 thousand participants signed up for the three races of the Macau International Marathon, with the title of the premier race going to Kenyan Victor Kipchirchir and Ethiopian Senay Mastewal Birhanu.
In addition to his triumph, Kipchirchir broke the Macau marathon record, finishing in two hours, nine minutes and 27 seconds, 34 seconds less than the previous record, set in 2017 by Ethiopian Felix Kiptoo Kirwa.</description><pubDate>2025-12-09 03:18:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorsport | GP will continue on the TCR World Tour in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/19/automobilismo-gp-continuara-no-tcr-world-tour-em-2026/</link><description>The Macau Grand Prix will once again form part of the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour calendar next season and, once again, as the season-ending event of a competition that will increase its presence in Asia in 2026
Marcelo Lotti, president of the WSC Group, confirmed to the press, during the weekend of the 72nd Macau Grand Prix, that next year's calendar should include a race in South Korea – home country of the tire brand and championship sponsor, Kumho, as well as Hyundai, the brand with the most cars on the starting grids of the world competition -, a second race in the People's Republic of China and the traditional end-of-season round at the Guia Circuit.
To increase the presence on the Asian continent, without affecting the teams' budgets, Australia will be left out of the calendar. The championship promoter will also not move forward with the possibility of organizing a second race on the American continent, with a visit to Mexico being a certainty. Already on the “old continent”, the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour will maintain its three events, with the Portuguese city circuit of Vila Real hosting one of these events in July.
For Marcello Lotti, “the Macau Grand Prix is ​​our equivalent to Monaco”, and for the Italian businessman, “all championships need an event like this”. Despite the smaller number of entrants that this year's event gathered in the territory, “leaving Macau is obviously out of the question”.
The 2026 Kumho FIA TCR World Tour season calendar is expected to be revealed to the public on December 13, when the FIA ​​World Council meets in Tashkent, Republic of Uzbekistan, at the same time as the FIA's annual awards ceremony.
Number questions
The list of participants for the Guia Race Macau – Kumho FIA TCR World Tour Event of Macau had only seventeen of the twenty-four cars initially registered. This would have been one of the smallest starting grids ever for the highly popular Guia Race, whose first edition took place in 1972. In part, this number below expectations was due to the absence, for unknown reasons, of teams and drivers from TCR China, one of the strongest national tourism championships in the world.
Meanwhile, Marcello Lotti said during the Grand Prix weekend that TCR is preparing to welcome a new brand to the championship. However, this announcement, scheduled for next Friday, is not expected to have an impact on the starting grids of the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour, as it will be a car group that already has a presence in the championship and will replace one of its brands with another. The Italian businessman also said he was in negotiations with a second brand.
Asia's influence on today's biggest Touring Car championship is not just limited to the Koreans from Kumho and Hyundai, as the competition also features the Chinese brand Link &amp; Co, at an official level, and the Japanese counterpart Honda. At a time when electric cars, SUVs and city cars are the focus of big brands, Asian manufacturers are still among the few that invest in cars, with fuel engines, with dimensions suitable for Touring events.</description><pubDate>2025-11-19 01:34:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Roadsport | Badaraco took the podium on his birthday, but ended up penalized</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/17/roadsport-badaraco-subiu-ao-podio-em-dia-de-aniversario-mas-acabou-penalizado/</link><description>On his birthday, Badaraco recovered from 17th to reach second place on the podium. Hours after the party, the bad news arrived, with a penalty relegating him to 15th. Rui Valente was placed off the track, after recovering several positions
On his birthday, Jerónimo Badaraco climbed to second place on the podium of the Roadsport Challenge race, after starting from 17th. However, the worst came later, when the top three, all local drivers, were penalized and relegated in the general classification, for overtaking other cars that had lost their way before the starting line, after the safety car had left.
The Macanese driver had a setback when he was relegated to 15th, after an almost perfect race: “It was very unfair and I think the stewards don't know what they are doing”, said Jerónimo. "I think the decision was not transparent. After the safety car came out, several drivers hit the barriers... of course we thought they weren't going to continue in the race after those crashes and we had to overtake them", he explained. “And even if we had stopped or slowed down in the face of these drivers' missteps, we would have created a much more dangerous situation for everyone, because the cars behind us would have been surprised by our braking, meaning there would have been more accidents”, he explained.
Even so, the Macanese assured HM that the penalty would not ruin his day: “I will continue to enjoy the day, I went up to the podium, drank the champagne, took the photos… More cup, less cup, I will continue to celebrate”, he guaranteed with a laugh.
Hours before, Badaraco had already explained that reaching the podium in Guia “is a different feeling” that justifies “80 percent” his choice to drive 26 years ago.
The driver was also satisfied with the race, considering that no one can take away the merit of what he achieved on the track, as he rose from 17th to 2nd: "Before the race I thought a lot about how I was going to approach the start, to recover positions, and I was confident of a good result. The most important thing was not to have given up, after qualifying, and not to have stopped believing that it was possible to reach the podium", explained the Macanese driver. “I know that the Guia Circuit always has a lot of changes throughout the race, there are a lot of safety cars and yellow flags, and I knew I had the experience, and also the calm, to be able to take advantage of the opportunities”, he highlighted.
“They ruined my race”
In turn, Rui Valente gave up and appeared disappointed, due to what he considered to be an excess on the part of the driver who tried to overtake him on the inside, on the curve leading to the São Francisco road. "I don't know what was going through the driver's head who tried to overtake me. I can't understand how he saw a space that simply didn't exist!", said Valente. "I was put out of the race. When I tried to make the turn, he touched me and that was it, my rear end was damaged and I had to go back to the pits to retire", he reported.
When the crash occurred that ended the race, Valente was circulating in the top 10, even after a less successful start, following the exit of the first Safety Car. Despite this aspect, the Macanese came to believe that it was possible to achieve a result in the top five: “I had a good pace, I was confident and I think I would achieve a result in the top five... It's the races...”, he lamented.
The Macanese also took stock of a “complicated” weekend in which he was also involved in another accident during the free practice session. "To be honest, it wasn't one of the weekends I had the most fun in Macau. I had that first touch, which conditioned my qualifying. In the race I actually did well, gaining positions, but they put me off the track...", he highlighted.
At 64 years old, Rui Valente now admits that he may be left out of the next edition of the Grand Prix: “With such a difficult qualifying model for Macau and then with races with so many accidents, I will consider what to do in the future”, he confessed. “I don't want to sit still, I want to stay active and involved in different activities, so if I find an activity that occupies me and makes me feel good, maybe I'll stay out of racing next year”, he said.
