The Director of Tourism Services argues that the challenges of reducing tourist spending should be fought with new tourist products and cultural experiences
 
After the end of border restrictions due to the fight against pandemic, a phenomenon was born in China entitled “Special Forces Tourist”, which designates visitors who “pick the point” in the largest number of sights in the shortest possible time. The main objective of “operations” is to feed social networks, spending as little money as possible.
The Director of Tourism Services (STD), Helena de Senna Fernandes, addressed the theme, in a series of government representatives to a delegation of journalists from the Great Bay. Speaking cited by the HK01 portal, the official admitted that in the face of economic retraction, tourist consumption estimates were reviewed, but ensured that Macau receives all visitors equally regardless of purchase capacity. However, to circumvent the current challenges, Senna Fernandes stresses that new ideas are needed, which encourages tourists, even if they visit Macao for a few hours just to take a memory of the territory. "We have to provide options to all types of tourists, from products from small neighborhood stores, to luxury experiences, and offer various consumption scenarios for all scholarships," said the official.
The STD leader points to the cultural area as a way to boost tourists consumption, with the organization of concerts and promotion of creative industries for tourists, such as memories.
Sleep here and there
Tourism of “Special Forces” originated controversy in Hong Kong, with the dissemination of tourist photographs staying overnight in the neighboring region's macdonald's, as well as at the airport. The same thing happened in Macao, with the sharing on the social networks of tourists sleeping in the lawn adjacent to Wynn Palace.
Despite the trend, Helena de Senna Fernandes stressed that the tourism sector shows a good evolution. Last year, more than 34.9 million people visited Macau, about 90 percent of the level before the pandemic. In the first five months of this year, more than 16 million tourists visited the territory, with the hotel occupation around 90 percent. In annual terms, the STD director expects this year's number of visitors to reach 39 million.
In the first quarter of this year, the average spending of tourists who visited Macao fell again, with a reduction of 13.2 percent in annual terms, part of the increase in tour, which represented almost 60 percent of entries in the first three months of the year.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:05:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Employment | Macau with another 3,000 tnr in 12 months</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/emprego-macau-com-mais-3-000-tnr-em-12-meses/</link><description>In the last 12 months, the number of non-resident workers has a 3,000 increase, according to data revealed yesterday by the Public Security Police (CPSP)
 
Macao companies and families have hired more than three thousand workers not resident in the last 12 months, it was released yesterday.
According to data from the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP), in late May, Macau had 183,783 workers without resident status, more 3,006 than in the same month as 2024. The labor from abroad, including from mainland China, reached the highest value since June 2020 at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Since the maximum peak of 196,538, reached in late 2019, before the pandemic, and until January 2023, the city lost almost 45,000 non-residents, which corresponded to 11.3 percent of the active population.
In January 2023, when the end of the Zero Covid policy, which was in force in Macao and mainland China for almost more than three years, Macau had less than 152,000 migrants, the lowest number since April 2014.
The statistics, released by the Directorate of Services for Laboral Affairs, reveal that, since the end of the Zero Covid policy, the number of non-resident workers increased on 31.905. The hotel and restoration sector was the one that has hired the most in the last 12 months, gaining 3,379 non-resident workers, followed by that of domestic employees (another 1,553).
The hotel area and the restoration had been precisely the most affected by loss of labor during the pandemic, having faced more than 17,600 non-resident employees since December 2019.
High visitors
The city received, in 2024, 34.9 million visitors, 23.8 percent more than the previous year, but still far from the record, 39.4 million, set in 2019, before the pandemic. Hotel establishments, on the other hand, welcomed more than 14.4 million guests, a new historical record.
The economic crisis created by the pandemic led the unemployment rate to reach 4 percent in the third quarter of 2022, the highest since 2006. Despite the number of non-resident workers, the unemployment rate remained 1.9 percent between February and April.
Still, several deputies have asked the government to force the six game dealers to say goodbye to the labor from abroad to ensure the use of the 5,600 local workers working in the 11 satellite casinos that will end by the end of 2025.
Three of the six dealers-SJM, Galaxy and Melco-communicated to the authorities on June 9, which will end by December 31 the exploration of the 11 existing satellite casinos in the territory. The 'satellite casinos' are managed by other companies, being an inheritance of the Portuguese administration, which already existed before the game's liberalization in 2002.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:00:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Maritime Areas | Order enlargement of protected zone</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/areas-maritimas-pedido-alargamento-de-zona-protegida/</link><description>O deputado dos Operários, Lam Lon Wai, considera que “os objectivos do planeamento marítimo de Macau” estão “bem definidos”, mas pergunta ao Governo se a zona de protecção pode ser alargada para preservar a biodiversidade e o ambiente. It is recalled that maritime zoning foresees the construction of two garbage landfills off Coloane, in full protected zone
 
Lam Lon Wai wants to see the protected maritime areas, which represent a “relatively low” proportion, to safeguard more effectively “Biodiversity and Maritime Ecosystems. Remember the Functional Maritime Zoning, which came into force exactly one year ago (July 1, 2024), established only a“ special protected zone of colon ” Near the Lotus Flower Bridge, and Cheoc Van and Hac Sá beaches, south of Coloane.
In addition to asking the executive if the extending the special protected special zone is being studied, the workers' deputy questions whether the authorities have other ways to protect natural resources and the marine environment.
In an oral interpellation released yesterday, the legislator demonstrates concerns about water quality and the environment, not to mention “two functional zones, which are the residue deposition zone from the port of Ká-Hó and the south of coloane waste deposition zone”, as indicated in maritime zoning. In fact, the southern landfill, entitled as the Government's Ecological Island, was the target of criticism of environmentalists due to the impact on the habitat of Chinese white dolphins.
Strangled tides
Despite not referring garbage deposits off the beaches, the deputy states that "the planning of the maritime areas of Macao continues to face several challenges." "At the ecological level, the landfills held in the areas between Macau and Zhuhai resulted in narrowing the waters of the inner port and Shizimen, with consequent reduction in tidal amplitude, the force of the sea currents and the self-purement capacity of marine water."
The changes caused by landfills “have enhanced the degradation of water quality, the emergence of red tides, the decrease in mangroads and the reduction of ecological resources,” says Lam Lon Wai.
The deputy cites the director of the cabinet for Hong Kong and Macao affairs of the Council of State, Xia Baolong, who presented expectations regarding the use and planning of the maritime areas of Macao. As such, Lam Lon Wai questioned the government about tourism promotion plans related to maritime ecology and preservation of ecosystems, as a way to diversify Macao's economy and reinforce the connection between residents and the sea.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:54:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Legislative Assembly | Direct suffrage lists with 84 candidates</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/assembleia-legislativa-listas-do-sufragio-directo-com-84-candidatos/</link><description>Most of the provisional candidates to the elections of September 14, by direct suffrage, are men, with a proportion of 53 percent.

Among the 84 candidates there is not a single born in Portugal or any other Portuguese -speaking country.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:52:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, Academic: “China is a reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended at the University of Aveiro the doctoral thesis that analyzes how China has been positioned in recent decades as an important actor in the “global health governance”. Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>India | Dalai-Lama reaffirms continuity</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/india-dalai-lama-reafirma-continuidade/</link><description>Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai-Lama reaffirmed yesterday the continuity of his institution, in one of the clearest statements to the date on the intention to secure a successor, six days of his 90th birthday.

At the end of almost three decades based in China, the cooking and Spanish businessman Carlos Miranda decided to try “something different”: cultivating tea in the north of Portugal and bringing Portuguese cuisine to Beijing.
"It is necessary to innovate," the businessman told Lusa, during a break at the Portuguese restaurant Calm, who inaugurated this year in the Chinese capital.
Sitting in a room attached to the establishment, Carlos Miranda prepares green tea on a traditional Chinese table. "Tea always fascinated me," he said. "I never drank coffee," he added.
In the corner of the table is a prescription book - the kitchen of Macau from my grandfather's house - published in 1992, by Graça Pacheco Jorge. Descendant of a family established in the territory since the seventeenth century, the author was a central figure in the dissemination of Macanese cuisine.
Carlos Miranda also is linked to Portugal of family origin, through a Portuguese-grandmother. “My family is from Zamora, in the northern interior of Spain, but I have family members in Lisbon,” he said.
With about 200 square meters and place for 40 people, the Portuguese restaurant is in the heart of Beijing's diplomatic zone, north of Sanlitun, one of the busiest and most cosmopolitan areas of the Chinese capital. The menu includes: Codfish to Brás, Lagareiro Octopus, Cabyla rice, seafood rice or duck rice. “Rice is attractive to the Chinese,” he said.
On the other hand
In the opposite direction, Miranda took to the north of Portugal tea, a drink originated in China for thousands of years. “I wanted to do something linked to ecological agriculture,” he said.
The agricultural project began about a year ago in the Minho region, in land near the Peneda-Gerês National Park. "The idea was to plant in the park, but as it is national ecological reserve it became impossible. I was on the slopes," said the businessman, praising the local conditions of moisture, altitude and soil.
"North Portugal is humid, has clean rivers and, in the last analysis, was the European country where, in a recent study, tea revealed better concentration of antioxidants," he said.
The first sheets will take time: "Only after four or five years can you start to spoon with quality."
The plantation was designed for a niche market, focused on biological and proximity product. "It makes no sense to compete with China or India. Let's do gourmet tea, with zero pesticide guarantee, for demanding consumers," he said.
Although he never worked directly in the tea industry, Carlos Miranda is an enthusiast. “I drink tea every day,” he confessed. While waiting for the first harvest in Minho, Carlos Miranda already serves the other side of the world Vinhos do Douro and Dão. "We have to do different things, not always be for the same," he said.
With history
In China, the Spaniard has built a career in restoration over 27 years, with several establishments that have become a reference among the expats community in the country.
"I am a training cook. I worked in Porto and Lisbon in the 1990s, and then I came to China. I had restaurants in Beijing, Liaoning, Dalian and Xiamen, when there was no western food in these cities," he said.
Calm down works with a team that knows Miranda's course well: "Chinese chief cooking has been with me for 20 years." Clients include Chinese Portuguese -speaking students and Chinese diplomats and professionals who lived in Lusophone countries: “I met very interesting people here.”
The agricultural project now forces you to spend more time in Portugal. "Tea requires care. In January we will build a small factory to process the product." Until then, get over and await. “It's a slow process, but that's what makes it interesting,” he concludes.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 05:41:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong promotes in Portugal technology in the construction of public housing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/hong-kong-promove-em-portugal-tecnologia-na-construcao-de-habitacao-publica/</link><description>The Hong Kong government announced yesterday that it will promote in Portugal the use of technology in the construction of public housing. According to a statement, Hong Kong authorities will organize in Portugal on Thursday a business lunch entitled “Unraveling New Horizons: accessible housing and opportunities in Hong Kong and the Great Bay”.
The Commissioner for the Development of the Great Bay, Maisie Chan Kit Ling, will make a speech about “the huge business opportunities” that the regional project offers to Portuguese entrepreneurs.
At the event will “share Hong Kong's experiences in increasing quantity, speed, efficiency and quality of public housing construction through the adoption of various innovative rapid and robotic construction technologies”. Hong Kong's secretary for housing, Winnie Ho Wing Yin, invited more than 20 representatives of the region's construction sector and mainland China to participate in the event.
These companies will talk about technologies such as prefabricated modules, the integration of mechanical, electrical and channeling facilities, and the use of robots in construction. The event may serve “to strengthen links between the sectors of Hong Kong and Portugal and explore business opportunities”, it underlines in the statement.
Ongoing
Also Maisie Chan and Winnie Ho will still participate in the 17th International Forum on Urbanism, which will take place between July 1st and 4th, in the renewed Pavilion of Portugal, which, after the works carried out by architect Siza Vieira, was transferred to the University of Lisbon.
The political program of the new Portuguese government, led by Luís Montenegro, provides for the construction of 59,000 public houses by 2030 and financing for more housing, including public-private partnerships in the State Real estate.
On June 17, the prime minister admitted to Parliament that the previous goal, to build 26,000 public houses by 2026, had "a difficult execution," but refused to be "defeatist and pessimistic." "I think we still have the ability to stimulate construction in the public sector," said Montenegro, pointing out that "the execution rate is now increasing."
"We have an execution fee in the universe of these 26 thousand houses of 27 percent and, according to the information that the municipalities have transmitted us by the end of June, 13,429 dwellings will be ready in this program," he said.
The prime minister also considered that it was necessary to exceed “administrative and bureaucratic blocks” that delayed the construction of new houses.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:31:25</pubDate></item><item><title>MICE | Government and CPSP organize lecture</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/mice-governo-e-cpsp-organizam-palestra/</link><description>Last Thursday, the Institute for the Promotion of Commerce and Investment (IPIM), the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) and the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) gave a lecture on the hiring and management of Personnel for the Macao Convention and Exhibition Sector (MICE).
The lecture, which gathered more than 120 represented from the sector, served to clarify “doubts and deepen knowledge about legal rules applicable to personnel hiring and the aspects to be observed during convention and exhibition events”.
One of the central points was the legal requirements of hiring non-resident workers (TNR), as well as the prohibition of illegal work. The lecture was organized about two weeks after the controversy about the legal situation of dozens of workers in the merchandising zone of a G-Dragon concert, which originated a joint operation of DSAL and CPSP.

Before hundreds of faithful and monks gathered at the McLeod Ganj's main temple in northern India, the Tibetan spiritual leader and the Nobel Prize for Peace has committed to “serving humanity” not only personally, but through the entity that represents, in a beam veiled to the continuity of spiritual lineage.
The Tibetan leader's statement took place during a Tenshug, an elaborate long -life offering ceremony organized this year by the Dhomey Province community. Using the traditional Pandita ceremonial yellow hat, Dalai Lama received, for about two hours, offerings from a long procession of devotees praying for their longevity.
At the age of 89, Dalai Lama has lived in India since 1959, the year he fled the Tibeta after a failed revolt against the Chinese occupation. Since then, it leads the Tibetan administration in exile, from the Indian city of Dharamshala, defending the autonomy of Tibet and the preservation of its culture.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Wu Zhen (1280-1354), one of the "Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty", lived in Jiaxing (Zhejiang) as many other literati despised by the bureaucracy of Mongol Dynasty, as it is in many of his paintings: isolated as a hermit in a fishing vessel "moving the rowing, thinking of the house where he wanted to go back, as he already put the sugarcane as he already wanted to go back, as he wanted to go back, as he wanted to go back, as he wanted to go back, as he wanted to go back, as he already wanted to go back, as he wanted to go back, already You don't want to fish anymore. »
One of his neighbor and painter named Sheng Mao (1313-1362), by Lin'an (current Hangzhou), who had moved to Jiaxing, living as a professional of this art, always had in mind the ideal of literate painters. In two paintings in the British museum that are attributed to him he is a servant in the middle of the forest, carrying a book in his hand (vertical roll, 99.6 x 29.2 cm) paint), in another a literate with his hands hidden by the cold walking in a snow-covered bridge towards a pavilion.
The name given to the painting is: reading, alumiassed in the reflection of the snow. Together, the title and the two paintings seem to allude to a story referred to by Liu Yiqing (403-444) in Shishuo Xinyu, "new account of the legends of the world", about the historical figure of Sun Sheng (c.302-373) that from the most early childhood to old age was always seen with a book in hand and so poor that at night, the reflection of the reflection of the winter, took advantage of the reflection of the winter. Moonlight over the snow to illuminate your reading.
An example of persistence of the desire to know certainly appreciated by literati, but also remarkably by an Emperor of the Yuan Dynasty who reigned twice, named Tugh Temur (1304-1332) known as Wenzong. And that, being a foreign, cultivated the arts, customs and traditions. From their efforts to impose local culture on the Mongoral rulers, the creation of Kuizhang Ge would be highlighted in the spring of 1329, the “Star of Literature Pavilion Academy”, which among other activities such as the compilation of classical texts also appointed literati capable of recognizing, studying and commenting on works of art. Some were painters, like a literate from Zhejiang.
Ke Jiusi (1290-1343) was one of those scholars (Boshi) of the Kuizhang Pavilion of which today can be read the comments on paintings and caligraffes of ancient masters such as Jing Hao (c.855-915) or Jiang Shen (c.1090-1138). In their own paintings, intuition in the composition of the landscape is notorious, which you see an example in the Mustard Garden Manual.
Or in a vertical roll where two high -sided Bambus stems painted for the 'hidden virtue pavilion' (Qingbige, paper on paper, 58.5 x 132.8 cm at the Palace Museum in Beijing). In these two rods that grow along with solid stones and when climbing cross, and in which he applied the rigor of the discipline of handwriting, he will have mirrored the will of the court to follow the great lonely masters like Wu Zhen.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai-Lama reaffirmed yesterday the continuity of his institution, in one of the clearest statements to the date on the intention to secure a successor, six days of his 90th birthday.

Taking the idea of ​​grammar that names the book, what are the main terms or concepts around Coloane, its tradition and preservation that can enumerate?
The “grammar” of the book introduces the concept of vernacular architecture, which reflects the knowledge of the informal, local construction and the maritime identity of this Coloane community. It addresses the assets at risk, proposing a method of cataloging existing houses, this digital method, which establishes a dialogue between tradition and modernity to preserve this cultural landscape.
What concrete proposals are suggested in the book for the protection and preservation of Coloane's stilts?
The book proposes (indirectly) the classification of stilts as a heritage to give them legal protection. By cataloging existing stilts, the book contributes to preserving the memory of this type of architecture and a broader discussion about its possible protection.
How could we reuse the stilts taking into account these specific ways of life and the economic diversification that the government wants to achieve?
The stilts could be reused for experience tourism, or centers of cultural interpretation, valuing local history. They can be transformed into creative and artistic spaces or in fact propose new wood buildings along the water line, with various uses and that can generate value to the Coloane community, contributing to Macao's cultural and economic diversification.
Why approach Coloane and the stilts? How did this project come about?
Coloane and the stilts were approached by their architectural and cultural uniqueness, representing a threatened memory and identity of Macao. This assets at risk has a significant potential. The project also emerged from the gap of scientific knowledge about these structures and the urgent need for documentation, consolidating itself as an academic-scientific investigation.
In the Asian or Southeast Asian context, are the coloane stilts or not unique in architectural terms?
Water constructions are common in various Asian countries, Coloane's stilts are not a unique case in terms of existence. See the example, in Hong Kong, of the well-known Tai o village, but are unique in their specific context. Its architecture is the reflection of local regional influences and materials, adapted to the history of the evolution of Colona's fishing community and the development of Macao. Its value lies in its particular architectural language and its persistence in a rapidly transformed urban environment.
What is the story behind the emergence of stilts? Are you associated with Coloane piracy reports, for example, which refer to the early twentieth century?
The stilts emerged as a practical and functional solution to the sea -related way of life, allowing sea access, tidal protection and efficient use of space in coastal areas. Piracy reports in Coloane were not the direct cause of their emergence. Shapes are essentially the response of an informal architecture of local communities to adapt to the maritime environment.
Museum Idea on Coloane Stop Stand since 2017
The need for preservation of coloane stilts is not a recent idea. Between 2017 and 2018, the Directorate of Tourism Services proposed the creation of a museum entirely dedicated to the stories of these dwellings arranged in Rua dos Navegantes, but the project was being postponed for legal reasons.
In 2018, the Tribuna de Macao newspaper (JTM) published an article where it referred precisely the absence of “legal foundations” for the construction of new infrastructure in the Maritime area of ​​Macao, something that has changed, however, given that the MSAR passed, from 2018, to include in its jurisdiction the management of 85 square kilometers of maritime zones.
Last year alone, the executive's plans for the creation of a “functional maritime zoning”, “maritime areas” and other related laws, and a concrete decision on what will be made on what will be made on the stilts. Both zoning and plan will be defined for a temporal period by 2040.
One of the objectives of the executive is environmental and ecological preservation, as well as certain experiences of the population. One of the points of the public consultation report speaks of “optimizing ocean exploration modalities according to Macau's development needs; coordinating the use of sea in production, daily life of the population and ecology” and performing “intensive and economizers uses to realize the rational allocation of maritime resources”.
In 2018, according to the JTM, STD assured that it would be necessary to “wait for the publication of the maritime area and administrative regulation on the administration of the use of maritime zones” and only then could you think of the planning of the museum. HM questioned STD of this article, and until the closing of this edition, obtained new clarifications.
A gradual development
In a master's dissertation in architecture, defended in 2023 at the University of Coimbra, Ana Rita Rodrigues made the study of the “Evolution of Macao Territory-Aterros and Urban Design in the Taipa and Coloane islands”, and concluded that “Portuguese occupation in the islands of Taipa and Coloane brought improvements in infrastructure, safety and village organization”. In the late nineteenth century, "there were already, in the islands, schools, hospitals and basic infrastructure, promoting the economic growth of the region."
Referring to the existence of stilts “used for the construction of fishing and housing boats for fishermen, naturally facing the river”, in a coloane zone composed “by precarious housing of one or two floors, unlike the type of common housing found in mud or macao, which was more focused on high development”.
The author also points out that “development was slower” in Coloane, as well as the absence, on both islands, of “a unified general plan and the need for better urban planning to ensure a cohesive and sustainable environment”.</description><pubDate>2025-06-24 23:53:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Teaching | I was entering local schools, but resources are scarce</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/ensino-ia-entrou-nas-escolas-locais-mas-recursos-sao-escassos/</link><description>The government has been betting on the introduction of artificial intelligence in territory schools, but with a few hours in the curriculum. In addition, schools complain of few resources to meet government goals
 
Macao schools have integrated artificial intelligence tools (AI) in classrooms, such as smart paintings and linguistic models, but some teachers warn that most are not prepared to comply with outlined policy for the sector.
After classes, students at Pui Va Secondary School remain in the classroom, distracted to explore a smart condition. These staff - explains Ruan Zhan Teng, school teacher at the school - act as interactive projectors and are used as soon as the first year, to write, watch videos or participate in classes with digital media.
"In the third year, students begin to learn to identify artificial intelligence in everyday life, basic programming and photos and videos generated by AI," the computer teacher added to Lusa.
The change took place in 2024 and is stipulated in the law: AI should be included in primary education (with a workload of 17 hours and 20 minutes per year), from 7th to 9th grade (19 hours and 20 minutes) and from 10th to 12th (18 hours and 40 minutes).
Despite the requirement, Andy Chun Wai Fan, professor and director of the University of Macao Information and Communication Center in Education, Note that schools face two obstacles: lack of resources and faculty formation.
“Some schools have only one information technology teacher,” said Fan, also referring that institutions generally have computer classes only once a week.
Do not update
Pedro Lobo, a teacher in this area, with 30 years of experience in the territory, including at the Portuguese School of Macau, is concerned about the lack of training. "Most teachers are already a certain age, they have not grown with this new technology ... So the mindset is still short of all this evolution, and change is being so fast that it can hardly follow," explained the Portuguese.
Education authorities require teachers 30 hours of annual IA training, however, Pedro Lobo considers not sufficient. Although this year has already studied almost 40 hours, the teacher says he is "little prepared".
Regarding this government policy, Andy Chun Wai Fan also remembers that it is required to schools that address ethics, innovation and collaboration in the domain of AI, although it fits the institutions the creation of the manuals themselves. “We do not have a manual about what to teach (…), each school has its own ideas about what to do with its students,” wolf reacted, explaining that he teaches “transferring AI to school work”, either through image generation, small game development, AI ethics approach and copyright issues.
Since 2021 at PUI VA
In a different record, the Pui Va Secondary School, which introduced AI in 2021, assumes to be “well prepared” to “the change”. The institution spends about two million patacas a year on AI tools, employs seven information technology teachers (IT) and hired a university professor in Beijing to support. “We want students to be able to use artificial intelligence to identify problems and solve real -life problems,” noticed the IT Office Director of Chinese educational establishment, Chong Wai Yin.
Here, students work, for example, with programming languages ​​(Python, Tencent, Iflytek), and AI models such as Deepseek and ChatgPT, engaging in intelligent city projects, in the first cycle, and in the creation of applications, at a later stage, said Zhao Qihao, former professor at the University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, who taught in Puija VA.
“In the first cycle, we developed smart cities, automated houses and AI -powered parking systems (…). In the second cycle, students create mobile applications and sustainable technological projects,” he explained.
In April, the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, LAM, announced that Macao's educational reforms for 2025 will focus on AI and include plans for an intelligent classroom in all schools.
The Government of Macao attributed to the school network under the direction of the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) 15 million PATACA for AI software for this academic year.
In an email sent to Lusa, DSEDJ stated that the government “attributes great importance” to the teaching of information technologies. "The medium and long term plan for non-higher education (2021-2030) identified 'reinforcement of creativity and technological education' as one of the main directions of development," he explains in the note.
However, Pedro Lobo questions the pressure on young students: "Are we seeing children 8, 9, 10 years old to develop applications? Maybe 1 percent is capable. The rest does the best they can. They have classes and homework that never end."
Concerned deputies
In the last debate of the Legislative Assembly, last Thursday, two deputies, Iau Teng Pio and Kou Kam Fai, linked to education, defended the need for “high quality development of education in Macao”, namely with the bet on AI.
One of the suggestions, referred to during the interventions before the day order, was the reinforcement of the “coordinated development mechanism between education, scientific and technological innovation and talent”, with the increase of “Stem resources [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] and artificial intelligence on basic education, rooting the basis of scientific literacy”.
In the debate on the 11th of this month, it was up to Deputy Ma Io Fong to appeal to AI regulation to avoid scams, but also to increase the awareness of society in relation to this new reality.
“With the rapid development of technology these days, the use of AI functions is gradually becoming important help for society and residents in daily life and work. However, AI can give rise to illicit acts, especially the worsening cyber attacks and the diffusion of false information.”
Also during the period of interventions before the agenda, the deputy asked the executive to “reinforce sensitization and education on the prevention of AI fraud, to sensitize the elderly and young people, emphasizing that the dissemination of false videos generated by AI can be a legal offense with serious consequences”.
In this context, the systematic integration of “AI safety knowledge in school curricula and the realization of different awareness and education activities with community associations was requested to increase public knowledge about AI technology and the risk derived for its abuse”.
"It is also due, through cooperation between the government, society, schools and the family, to reinforce the ability to respond to information and the internet discourse, allowing to react, clarify and follow up on useful time, when the public faces information that can cause negative influences or be misleading," said Ma Io Fong in the 11th debate.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 23:45:47</pubDate></item><item><title>History | The MA-chan escape to the colonial and macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/historia-a-fuga-dos-ma-chan-para-o-portugal-colonial-e-para-macau/</link><description>The MA-chan family is from Mozambique with Chinese roots, sought its new path in the then colonial Portugal and since 1976 that set roots in Macao. José Manuel Machon, resident in the territory since he was 13, told Lusa the very peculiar trajectory of his family, which reflects many of the family directions taken in the years of war and the end of the Portuguese colonial empire
 
The MA-chan, the Mozambican family with roots in China, fled twice to communism and twice resumed in colonial Portugal. In 1976, they landed in Macao, where Mozambique's memory had erased with the departure of the Landins, African troops that parked in the territory for decades since 1912.
According to a report by Luís Andrade de Sá published in Macau magazine in 1992, and quoted by the blog "Chronicles Macanese", the Landins were in Macao "for about five decades", and "the Chinese never used to their conviviality, suspiciously who had the huge blacks who played a horrible drumsticks while returning the ostensiva. ferocity ”. The term Landim became a reference “to identify all indigenous battalions that passed by Macau”, is described in the same report.
Massá Ma-chan went in 1963 to the Namphlam, northern Mozambique Conservatory to register the fifth son, but once again denied this Chinese, with roots in Guangzhou, the transmission of the nickname to descent. José Manuel was the same as his brothers: the nickname Machon, corruption of MA-chan.
The identity of José Manuel Machon, embryoly marked by this bureaucratic detail imposed by the then Portuguese Mozambique, is not only a reflection of the colonial past of Portugal, but from the beginnings of Sino-Mozambican relations.
“I don't have great confusion, I tried to adapt to life,” he tells Lusa in Macau, where he has lived since he was 13. The grandfather-also MA-chan-was the one who defined that this story began in Africa, leaving China looking for better life, in the starter of the twentieth century, and settling in Nampula, alongside Sharing, a Macua woman, Mozambican ethnic group.
Massá, the son -and father of José Manuel -was sent to Guangzhou at 14, to receive formal education there. When he returns to Mozambique, he is a married man with a bullet mark near his left shoulder.
In China, he faced the Japanese in World War II and married a Chinese, which he met on the day of marriage, until, on the threshold of the civil war, which would victory to Mao Zedong's communists, fled. He dedicated himself to Nampula to the cucumber of the cucumber-the 'Magojojo'-and the tubar bit, which he exported to Hong Kong.
The Great Return
However, unable to adapt, the woman returned to Macao with her four children, where she died. Massá returned to marry, this time with a Mozambican - José Manuel came first, Carla later.
When the Frelimo flag raised on the mast in Mozambique on June 25, 1975, the MA-chan-headed Macao, with a brief passage in Portugal, where they inhabited a pension paid by the then IARN.
“We are nothing returned, because we have not returned anywhere, we are refugees,” says Carla Machon, residing in Portugal.
“When my father heard again about communism, he fled,” says his brother, José Manuel. While speaking, bowling balls pack on the floor and travel the track to a new crash. The noise in the center of Bowling Future Bright does not seem to bother this big man, 61, fluent in Cantonese and Portuguese and president of Macao Bowling Club. “This is what keeps me stable. Instead of going to the glasses, I come here,” he notes.
For Joseph, independence "it was an open openness, an opening to the world." It doesn't even talk about political reasons, but how important it was to cross half a world until you arrived in Macau.
A new life
In this page turn, the MA-chan/maachon family came to find, in 1976, a city with little civil presence abroad. José and Carla do not remember other Mozambicans, who began to arrive after independence, many from Portugal.
Mong-Há's fortress is an old witness to Mozambique's presence in Macau. Then the Landins, Mozambican soldiers at the service of the Colonial Army were quartered, recalls journalist João Guedes, a scholar in the history of Macao. It is this historical circumstance that baptized the hill of Mong-há of “Mountain of Black Ghosts”.
These troops, with the “greatest warrior instinct”, in the expression of Emperor Gungunhana, remained in Macao half a century, until around the 1960s. They were responsible, for example, by the storage of the siege gates, border of the territory with China and recurring incident place.
“They passed by and faded as if they had never been,” resumes Guedes, indicating that there was no material heritage attesting this military presence. Not far from Mong-Há, but at the Riquexó restaurant, troops are still there, eternalized in photos hanging on the walls.
This serves African chicken, macanese dish, whose origin is still today the target of debate. Two theories: It was created by the Portuguese chief Américo Ângelo, inspired by a trip to Mozambique. Another version realizes that, seeing the African soldiers missing roasted chicken, Americo made the dish.
And the memory of macau-moca-mandamous relationships is not complete without evoking the trafficking in leaf. If, on the one hand, it is known that the Portuguese took slaves from the African colonies by settling in the doors of China, in reverse, were also sent via Macao, Chinese to work in Mozambique, often in slavery conditions.
The sons were part of a migratory movement from the late nineteenth century, “to develop the Mozambican colony,” explains the professor at Joaquim Chissano University in Maputo, Fatima Papelo, who investigates Sino-Mozambican cooperation. The first group, he says, was sent in 1858 and "consisted of 30 men."
More than a century later, in the struggle for Mozambican independence, Beijing supported the Liberation Front of Mozambique (Frelimo) and is one of the first countries to recognize the new sovereign state. In Macao, the reinforcement of the ties was later paid, with the transition from the territory of Portugal to China in 1999.
But for José Manuel, Mozambique was always present. The last time it went, tells, visited and cleaned the family campaign, "there at Machamba". "It's a Chinese custom," he explained.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 02:46:38</pubDate></item><item><title>China-Portuguese | Chengdu Pavilion shows Portuguese products</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/china-portugal-pavilhao-em-chengdu-mostra-produtos-portugueses/</link><description>In the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion venture in Chengdu, pavilions for foreign countries and entrepreneurs who want to establish business in China are installed. Portugal is also there, represented by the Portugal Pavilion, but according to manager Ângelo Sousa, there is a lack of support from the Portuguese government and strength to combat competition
 
“For us there are no barriers between Portugal and China. We are 365 days here and there.” This is the way the objectives of the team that is behind the Portugal Pavilion present at the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion are presented in Chengdu and which is managed by two partners: Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa.
The two realized that the Shanghai zone had reached a saturation point in the trade of products and that it was necessary to go more to the interior of the country to try to sell things as Portuguese as wine, cod or olive oil.
HM talked to Yinhui Tui about this project on the fringes of a lunch in Lisbon by the Friends of the New Seda Route Association, chaired by Fernanda Ilhéu. The event served precisely for Yinhui Tui to present the objectives of the Portugal Pavilion and try to capture business interests.
“This is a very important market for Portuguese products. In China we have separated the country [in commercial terms] in four markets. We have the region of Beijing and Shanghai, which we call 'Yangtze River Economic Zone', and 'Pearl River Economic Zone'. The fourth zone is composed by the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing and which is a new economic area established in 2020. Portuguese have a lot of potential in these markets, ”he said.
The businessman recalls that the marketing of Portuguese products is still below what is done by French, Spanish or other countries, but when the Chinese buyer discovers wine or olive oil, he is surprised.
"In Shanghai, for example, some customers already have their opinion on French or Australians. But many think that Portuguese products have more quality," said Yinhui Tui, noting that in the area where the Portugal Pavilion operates in Sichuan province, "people are a little more conservative and prefer to try, prove and feel before buying."
"Our pavilion is next to the French pavilion and we often see customers opt for French wine. But when they go through our pavilion, they see our brands and ask what we have. When they realize that we have cheaper wine compared to French, they are surprised and say it is better, and then buy."
This responsible explains that the population in the fourth economic zone is 130 million people, much more than the number of people living in the Iberian Peninsula. "Then I think it's a market with a lot of potential," he said.
The Role of Lusosino
Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa created Lusosino that it acts as the managing entity of the pavilion, which was born “with the intention of promoting Portuguese products in the Great Market of China”. Thus, there is a “showroom” of very Portuguese products, representing some brands known as is the case of Vieira crackers, Esporão wine, Sal Marnoto, the Prisca jams or Vista Alegre, among others. It is in this pavilion that "exhibitors display the best products, buyers discover trends and where they both find the conditions to realize business." Moreover, Lusosino, through this pavilion, helps Portuguese entrepreneurs in marketing campaigns and in the best way to contact potential Chinese customers.
Specifically, Lusosino promises to perform “producer and brands records, commercial representation, market analysis, market support and preparation, among other services”, reads on the website.
However, and according to Ângelo Freitas de Sousa to HM, there are many obstacles to putting Portuguese products in China. “[The Chengdu and Chongqing zone] has the advantage of being a growing market that is not overloaded with exporters and has no addictions as happens in the Shanghai zone. It is a very large market and where there are many producers.” By addictions, the entrepreneur refers to “competition” from other countries and buying habits of Chinese customers, who are faster looking for products from other nationalities than from Portugal. "There are habits of certain brands that are implemented and people don't even look at others or experience them."
The Portuguese Pavilion project began with an idea of ​​Ângelo Ferreira de Sousa, who has a Chinese wife who helps him in the business. “I met Yinhui Tui, he liked Portuguese products, we were friends and then we ended up joining energy,” he said, explaining that the interior of the country is still knowing foreign products, not just Portuguese.
"The Shanghai zone has nowhere to grow and this is a growing economic zone. There are many factories that are moving to Chengdu, so there will be more development," he said.
Absence of marketing
The Portuguese entrepreneur regrets that the Portuguese authorities have given little support to the project, except for any follow -up by AICEP - Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade of Portugal.
"All the investment was made by us and we have not had a lot of support. We had some help from AICEP, but nothing special. We do fairs, the showrooms, to prove and know our products in major cities," said Angelo Ferreira de Sousa.
The entrepreneur also regrets that, despite the list of hundreds of years between Portugal and China, there is still flaws in the commercial strategy for the export of Portuguese products in the country. "The Spaniards are much further ahead than us," he said.
Regarding the role of Macao as a platform, the entrepreneur says it is equally difficult to bring products from Portugal to China or Macau to China, due to lack of customs agreements and little flexibility.
"It is not because we call Macau that I can, for example, putting sausages, cod or preserves in China, or other Portuguese products. To pass from Portugal to Macau is easy, but it is no longer so easy to take after Portuguese products from Macau to China. We have not been able to do much through Macau, but we have not sought much," he said.
At the presentation in Lisbon, Yinhui Tui advanced some figures behind the construction of the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion, and help to understand their size: about 70 billion euros of investment and a space of 300,000 cubic meters. The Portugal Pavilion does not only do contact sessions or fairs: if a businessman wants to leave tons of products there, he can do so. Then the pavilion is in charge of distribution through several areas of China. “In the southern market, closer to Macao, there is a lot of competition in some areas, so it should be betting inside China,” said Yinhui Tui, referring to the potential and factor novelty that exists in some areas of the country regarding commerce.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 00:50:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | “Soldier of Mao” claims innocent and says he was six days unable to take a shower</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/18/eleicoes-soldado-de-mao-afirma-se-inocente-e-diz-que-esteve-seis-dias-sem-conseguir-tomar-banho/</link><description>Accused of electoral corruption and having an illegal Mahjong business, Wong Wai Man yesterday returned to the load to cry out his innocence. The president of the Iron and Steel Shipowners Association says he was “provoked” to climb to the roof where he was a few hours, and was six days without being able to bathe or change clothes
 
The panorama of the legislative elections for the hemicycle already boils. In addition to these are the elections with the smallest number of candidate lists since the creation of the MSAR, the controversy is installed with the almost candidate Wong Wai Man, who tried to submit his candidacy without success.
Also known as the “Soldier of Mao” and “Captain of Macao”, and after being accused of electoral corruption and having an illegal Mahjong business, behold Wong Wai Man yesterday returned to explanations: refuses the accusations that he is targeted, says he was persecuted by the authorities and refers to “torture” how it was dealt with.
The president of the Iron and Steel Association was on Monday, several hours on a roof of a house made with a metal plate in the mud, having been rescued by the Fire Department. A solution that says it was “provoked” after being detained by the Judiciary Police (PJ), referred to the Public Prosecution Service and receiving the Commissioner's Call against Corruption (CCAC), which accuses him of having the illegal business.
Wong Wai Man explained that, shortly after leaving the CCAC Office in the Nape area, he was intercepted by an employee of this body that alleged the lack of signature in some documents. However, not satisfied with the situation, Wong Wai Man picked up a taxi towards the mud, eventually taking refuge on the roof. "I had no other option, CCAC wanted to chase me to death. So I was on the roof," he explained.
Regarding accusations of electoral corruption, man says he is poor and is unable to commit such illegalities. Regarding Mahjong's alleged illegal business, Wong Wai Man stressed that the Association's headquarters in fact has Mahjong tables, but only for the enjoyment of the partners.
Regarding the use of money in these games, Wong Wai Man said there was always a sign to say that it was forbidden to be bets on money and that there was, at the association's headquarters, a box for donations, but that was intended for voluntary support of the members to help the association's operation.
This is because, according to this, besides being president is also the only one to support all expenses of the Iron and Steel Association, namely those related to income, water and light, given that since 2014 that the entity has not received subsidies.
One thing is certain: the association's headquarters will close doors tomorrow due to the end of the lease. Wong Wai Man says that for now, he will not look for a new address for the association because, for now, he has a more pressing subject: looking for a place to live. Wong Wai Man made the association's headquarters to his home.
Life lesson
Despite having missed the opportunity to submit a list and be a candidate for elections for the Legislative Assembly by Via Direct, Wong Wai Man argued that the most important thing was to participate in the whole process and learn new things. The "captain of Macao" also said that he is dedicated to society of heart and not by selfishness. Your ideal is to do things justly for society, since it argues that traditional associations do not defend the people.
Wong Wai Man also told journalists a personal episode to justify their participation in social and public causes. "In 2007 my wife was pregnant and the hospitals convinced her to end the pregnancy because the baby's survival rate would be 50 percent, due to the fact that a fetal anomaly was detected after the exams. I insisted and the government eventually paid the operation worth 70 thousand patacas. So I want to make my contribution to return a favor" to heaven "," he said.
Six days without bathing
According to the All About Macau newspaper, Wong Wai Man reported that he was still six days without bathing and sleeping, having remained a week missing until he performed with CCAC this Monday. Before he did, he said he was a total of six days detained, which for himself was “torture”, and that in total was all this time without bathing, sleeping or changing clothes. On Sunday, you will have been able to go home.
“Last night [Tuesday] I was finally able to sleep well and shower. I was six days without being able to bathe or change my clothes,” he explained. The climb to the roof of the house in the mud was also a form of protest by the way it was treated, he said.
The detention took place at dawn last Wednesday, the 11th, between 3 am and 4 am, with the argument that Wong Wai Man would maintain an illegal Mahjong business. It was then that he was detained for 48 hours in a squad in the mud, and was then transferred to the Public Prosecution Service (MP) to continue to make statements.
After this process, he was notified to present himself with CCAC, having signed the requested documents. He was then arrested again for another 48 hours and transferred again to the MP. When, already on the street, he was again informed that he would have to return to CCAC to sign more documents, decided to escape and take refuge on the roof.</description><pubDate>2025-06-18 23:46:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Breast Cancer | Research of one does “revolutionary discovery”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/18/cancro-da-mama-investigacao-da-um-faz-descoberta-revolucionaria/</link><description>A study by a team led by two professors at the University of Macao seeks answers to combat breast cancer. Academics concluded that cancer cells spread mainly through the lymphatic system, not by the bloodstream
 
“The lymphatic system is the main route for breast cancer dissemination and metastasis, revealed by tracking unique cell lineage” is a scientific article that seeks to increase knowledge that allows you to find solutions to the disease. The work was developed by a research team led by the full professor Chuxia Deng and assistant professor Miao Kai at the University of Macao Faculty of Health Sciences (one) and, according to a note from UM, is a “revolutionary discovery in the study of cancer metastases”.
Thus, and for the first time, “a qualitative and quantitative analysis of breast cancer metastases was made, and was applied by scientists“ a barcode system based on an unique cell lineage tracking approach ”called Celltag.
With this method, results were obtained that reveal that "cancer cells spread mainly through the lymphatic system, not by the bloodstream." In addition, he points out one, “research also found that interaction between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) determines the metastatic potential of cancer cells”, ie whether or not they may easily reproduce.
In this sense, “the study systematically demonstrates the roads of tumor metastases and opens new ways for the development of cancer treatment strategies”, is described.
The article was published in the magazine “Molecular Cancer” and is the result of an investigation by a vast team, consisting of Kai Miao, Aiping Zhang, Xiaodan Yang, Yipeng Zhang, Anqi Lin, Lijian Wang, Xin Zhang, Heng Sun, Jun Xu, Yuzhao Feng, Fangyuan Shao, Sen Guo, Zhihui Weng, Peng Luo, Xiaoling Xu and Ch -xia Deng.
Highlight for the collaboration of scientists from other higher education institutions in the region, such as Aigping Zhang, Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital University, and Jingyao Zhang and Shuai Gao, linked to China Agricultural University in Beijing. In turn, Dong Wang and Xiao-Yang Zhao are linked to Southern Medical University's School of Basic Medical Sciences in Guangzhou.
Microenvironment is an important factor
One explains, in the same statement, that the study in question “provides empirical evidence for route preference in cancer metastasis”, demonstrating that tumor cells are “pre-programmed” with “intrinsic information that determine their metastatic potential”, and these cells “adapt dynamically their genetic expression based on the target organs”.
Thus, "these findings establish the foundations for the development of therapies directed to lymphatic metastasis, such as inhibition of cytokine signaling or interruption of communication between tumor and stroma to suppress metastasis."
In the investigation, “single cell RNA sequencing technology” was used, which allowed the team to “discover that genetically identical tumor cells exhibit profiles of organ -specific genetic expression”, so the microenvironment proves “fundamental in the formation of tumor cell behavior”.
"For example, pulmonary metastatic cells positively regulate oxidative stress -related genes, while hepatic metastatic cells activate metabolic regulatory pathways," is referred to.
The danger of metastases
One points out that, in cancer diseases, metastases are the main cause of death. However, to date, "the mechanisms that govern the selection of the route" of these same metastases remained "obscure."
“Using Celltag technology, the research team traced the spread of breast cancer cells on mice models,” discovered that “less than 3 percent of cancer cells spread throughout the bloodstream, while more than 80 percent metasta through the lymphatic system for distant organs such as lungs and liver”.
Thus, "further analysis has shown that lymph spread cells have distinct genetic expression patterns and communicate closely with stromal cells, such as endothelial fibroblasts and cells in the microenvironment, forming an adaptive" seed-solo "mechanism."
Looking at the study, the authors explain that cancer metastasis “is a process in which the tumor cells of the primary tumor invade the basal membrane of the blood or lymphatic vessels (intravasation), travel the blood or lymphatic system and colonize distant organs and tissues to continue their development”. Several studies point to the fact that metastases are responsible for 70 to 90 percent of cancer -related mortality, and “the dissemination of tumor cells in the vasculature and lymphatic vessels occurs simultaneously in the vast majority of cancers”.
Blood roads
In the discussion of the results, the study authors say that, in general terms, “tumor cells metastatize mainly through blood circulation and lymphatic system”, and until the publication of this work had been performed “numerous studies to distinguish the role of both systems in the various phases of cancer metastasis”, without knowing “which way’ for metastasis ”.
It is referred to in the article, citing other studies that “cancer cells enter the bloodstream through intravasation to become CTCs [Circulating Tumor Cells-Tumor Cells in circulation], having revealed highly correlated with the survival results of breast cancer patients”.
The authors also explain that “the lymphatic system is considered critical for metastasis” because “melanoma cells with experience in the lymphatic system were more resistant to ironPtosis and formed more metastases”, and in cases of “cancer tumor resection, cancer cells can further disseminate the lymphatic ganglia for blood vessels and form tumors and forming tumors metastatic in the lungs ”.
To date, “although metastatic dissemination was viable by both ways, the relative importance of each process for a certain type of cancer and the target organ was unknown due to the lack of adequate quantitative tools”, something to which this study, using the celltag system, intended to respond.
Thus, "we demonstrate that most lung and liver metastatic cells can be detected in the lymphatic system rather than CTCs [circulation tumor cells] derived from the blood, indicating that the lymphatic vessels can be the favorite way for tumor cell metastasis, at least in breast cancer."
The authors promise not to stop here in the discovery of the course made by the metastasis of carcinogenic cells, having already performed "preliminary tests" with some cells in order to find out the possibility of "drastic" reduction of tumor cells disseminated by lymphatic. "We will continue to work on this to deepen the lymphatic dissemination mechanism and explore therapeutic interruptions in our future efforts," he is mentioned.</description><pubDate>2025-06-18 02:57:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Commerce | CUPPA Coffee manager calls for support to Portuguese companies</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/17/comercio-gestor-do-cuppa-coffee-pede-apoio-a-empresas-portuguesas/</link><description>The story of Cuppa Coffee dates back to 2008 when it was hard to find a space in Macau to drink good coffee. The location in the old mud brought fame to the project, but the space ended up closing doors and moving to Studio City. João Incarnation, who manages coffee, speaks of the news and the importance of supporting Lusophone matrix projects
 
It all started in the mind of Portuguese Cristiana Figueiredo, at a time when for a Portuguese or passionate about coffee living in Macau it was hard to find a space to enjoy this drink accompanied by bakery or pastry products, in good Portuguese way.
Cristiana Figueiredo said, in an interview with the Macao Commerce and Investment Promotion Institute (Ipim), which led her to invest in this type of business. "In Europe, people have a habit to go to coffee and to work for work. When I came to Macau for over 20 years, I realized that the Portuguese coffee culture is not popular in Macao, so I was born the idea of ​​opening a coffee in Macao, hoping to promote the food and culture of Portuguese coffee."
Since 2008, Cuppa Coffee, associated with the initial project of the businesswoman, Nata Bakery, founded in 2007 and focused on bakery and pastry products, has become one of the favorite spaces of the Portuguese, foreign and even resident of the territory. However, the direction of the economic environment, with greater difficulties in paying lace, has dictated some transformations to the project, which now ends doors to the entrance of Taipa Velha and also with Lakes Nam Van, to be only in the Studio City venture in Cotai. The closure in the lakes Nam Van took place in January.
At HM, João Incarnation, director and shareholder of the company that generates Cuppa Coffee, explains that, in fact, the change to the Cotai was decided for a long time. "I often say that there was no change to Studio City, because this was a plan that already existed and that came regardless of the taipa store closure. We would always open this space regardless of whether we continue, or not, with the store in the mud, whose closure was due to a failed negotiation regarding space income."
According to João Incarnation, who today generates the company with Nicole Massa Helm, both considered that "in the current economic situation there was no conditions to continue in that space, which is relatively large and had its costs."
"We needed to contain if we wanted the business to continue to work, because the alternative is always to close completely. We did not give up on the idea of ​​opening anything in the mud and being a little closer to our regular and more faithful customers, so we continue to open another establishment in the mud that can serve customers who live there. Therefore, there is no proper trip to Stadio City," João said, " Incarnation.
The director and shareholder understands that this change always causes some nostalgia. “We pity it to have closed it. It cost us, we really have a lot of pity,” he confessed. "It was a decision that could have been made longer, at least a year, but we still tried to keep the establishment there, but we were not possible. We will see what the future reserves us."
Despite these changes, Cuppa Coffee can be considered a successful case. "It worked there for many years and it worked well. This is a business that has to have certain conditions to work because, as we know, it has a lot of movement, but with little performance regarding each client. It is a business that needs many customers to support themselves, and for many years, at the level of rent values ​​and everything else, suppliers for example, it was much cheaper and things worked better," he recalls.
The location in Taipa Velha gave Cuppa Coffee “a very large recognition and clientele”, despite the growing difficulties. "As prices were increasing, we also needed to increase our prices, but never in proportion to the increase in expenses. There was a time when we could not continue," he assumed.
What the future reserves
João Incarnation ensures that what customers have always sought in this space will continue in Studio City: good coffee and pastry products, with the presence of Portugal. "We always try to introduce new products. We created a new, coffee and coconut -based drink, which is excellent. We also introduced the" Nata Bomb ", a Milkshake Beat Concept flavored Nata, a true bomb," he described.
There are also “traditional Portuguese products that did not exist before, such as bay bread”, as well as the donuts with different flavors, “to complete the offer we have”. "Our offer is already so varied that, even without introducing more products, it is sufficient to satisfy the values ​​of Portuguese customers and others as well."
John Incarnation also said that the change of establishment to Studio City was born from an invitation. “We don't know how to run yet, it's a bet that we are making right now”, and the goal is always to go back to street coffee. "The concept of having a neighborhood store or on the street is something that interests us a lot and we are already seeing other possibilities," he added.
"I don't have enough data to tell you that the change to Studio City is a winning bet. It's different, just like the concept, and we will have another type of customers beyond the usual."
A “Heart” project
Looking back, John Incarnation says that, for example, major problems have never been registered with human resources. "To this day we do not feel the big problem with lack of labor, it has never been something that has greatly affected us. Nowadays it is not as easy as it used to have quotas [for non-resident workers], as there are enough places that need placement. It is able to be easier, at this time, to get more local workers than before," he said, confirming that lace remain to be the big problem for such business.
“Cuppa Coffee is a project of the heart and during the pandemic I realized that I was going to close. I also realized that there was a series of closures, almost simultaneously, from other Portuguese establishments. Talk to my partner, who has a lot of experience in this area, and told him that I liked to try to keep Cuppa Coffee open. Possible to continue exactly the same concept and the same quality as it had been having with Cristiana, who did an excellent work in the creation and growth of Cuppa Coffee. ”
Overcoming the pandemic years, and at a time when Macau faces a break in local consumption, João Incarnation says that "it fulfills a bit to the Portuguese community to make the possible to support the effort we do so that everything is still open."
"I am not just talking about Cuppa Coffee, but also from wheat d'Ouro, butteria, Portuguese restaurants and Lord Stow, which is not a typical Portuguese business is based on Portuguese culture. All these businesses have to be fed and supported. For our part, we must maintain quality, but the Portuguese community has to take advantage of what exists and support the Portuguese business."
Despite the breach of consumption by the places, João Incarnation says that a balance with the consumption of tourists is guaranteed. "We feel a little [Break of consumption], but we can counterbalance with the offers we make and that satisfy the taste of local Chinese and visitors. But of course [Breaking of Consumption] has, of course, impact on business, not just the Portuguese, and this is in the city. But I think there is still some critical mass to keep Portuguese business open," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-06-17 00:32:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | António Lei replaces Casimiro Pinto</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/forum-de-macau-antonio-lei-substitui-casimiro-pinto/</link><description>The new deputy secretary general secretary of the Permanent Secretariat of the Macao Forum by appointment of the MSAR.

Dsama stressed that the garbage that has floated in the waters of Macau in recent days is mainly consisting of branches of plants and household waste, and that result in cleaning work, both on the beaches and in the sea. To this end, Dsama has hired a cleaning company to reinforce human resources in the operation.
However, it warns that due to meteorological conditions, the direction of the wind, the ocean currents and the geographical factors, it is expected that waste will continue to float in the waters of Macao and to coast throughout the week. Also cleaning work will continue.
Waste | Environmentalist defends treatment and recycling
The MSar Government should follow Hong Kong's example in the treatment of inert materials and construction waste, to make landfills, or recycle and reuse these materials as construction aggregates to make cement or bricks.
The suggestion was presented yesterday by the vice president of the Macao Environmental Protection Construction Industry Association, Chan Kuai Son, in statements to the Macao Chinese Macao Forum Macao Program. The conversation, in which he also participated the president of the Association of Macao Architects, Leong Chong In, had as its motto the cooperation agreement for the management and disposition of demolition and construction waste, which will allow the MSA to send waste to treatment in China.
Leong Chong in was pleased with the agreement and defended the creation of a landfill for construction waste in the maritime areas of Macao, as available landfills are at the maximum capacity.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:57:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Maritime Areas | Order enlargement of protected zone</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/areas-maritimas-pedido-alargamento-de-zona-protegida/</link><description>Workers' deputy, Lam Lon Wai, considers that “the objectives of Macao Maritime Planning” are “well defined”, but asks the government if the protection zone can be extended to preserve biodiversity and the environment.

Lam Lon Wai wants to see the protected maritime areas, which represent a “relatively low” proportion, to safeguard more effectively “Biodiversity and Maritime Ecosystems. Remember the Functional Maritime Zoning, which came into force exactly one year ago (July 1, 2024), established only a“ special protected zone of colon ” Near the Lotus Flower Bridge, and Cheoc Van and Hac Sá beaches, south of Coloane.
In addition to asking the executive if the extending the special protected special zone is being studied, the workers' deputy questions whether the authorities have other ways to protect natural resources and the marine environment.
In an oral interpellation released yesterday, the legislator demonstrates concerns about water quality and the environment, not to mention “two functional zones, which are the residue deposition zone from the port of Ká-Hó and the south of coloane waste deposition zone”, as indicated in maritime zoning. In fact, the southern landfill, entitled as the Government's Ecological Island, was the target of criticism of environmentalists due to the impact on the habitat of Chinese white dolphins.
Strangled tides
Despite not referring garbage deposits off the beaches, the deputy states that "the planning of the maritime areas of Macao continues to face several challenges." "At the ecological level, the landfills held in the areas between Macau and Zhuhai resulted in narrowing the waters of the inner port and Shizimen, with consequent reduction in tidal amplitude, the force of the sea currents and the self-purement capacity of marine water."
The changes caused by landfills “have enhanced the degradation of water quality, the emergence of red tides, the decrease in mangroads and the reduction of ecological resources,” says Lam Lon Wai.
The deputy cites the director of the cabinet for Hong Kong and Macao affairs of the Council of State, Xia Baolong, who presented expectations regarding the use and planning of the maritime areas of Macao. As such, Lam Lon Wai questioned the government about tourism promotion plans related to maritime ecology and preservation of ecosystems, as a way to diversify Macao's economy and reinforce the connection between residents and the sea.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:54:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Legislative Assembly | Direct suffrage lists with 84 candidates</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/assembleia-legislativa-listas-do-sufragio-directo-com-84-candidatos/</link><description>Most of the provisional candidates to the elections of September 14, by direct suffrage, are men, with a proportion of 53 percent. The average ages of candidates is 43 years, ranging from 20 years and 78 years
 
The provisional lists of participants in the direct suffrage of the 14 September legislative elections have a total of 84 candidates, 48 ​​male and 36 female. Provisional lists were presented on Friday, at a time when they can still be vetoed by the State Security Defense Commission.

At the opposite pole, the list with greater female representativeness is the good home alliance, linked to the Association of Women, with 10 women (71 percent) and 4 men (29 percent), in a total of 14 candidates.
There are two lists where the proportion between men and women is the same, as with the Synergy Power list, which supports Deputy Ron Lam, and which presents three men and three women. This is the list of workers, the union for development, with six men and six women, in a total of 12 candidates.
Among the remaining four lists, there are three in which men are mostly, as with the Popular Liveliod Force list in Macao (four men and three women), Macao United Citizens Association (six men and four women), and Macao-Guangdong Union (11 men and three women).

Thus, it continues to import fresh and living food products, food products of animal origin, sea salt and seaweed, including vegetables, fruits, milk and dairy products, aquatic products and derivatives, meats and derivatives or poultry eggs from 10 municipalities in Japan, namely Fukushima, Chiba, Ibaraki, Gunma, Migi, Miyagi, Miyagi Niigata, Nagano, Saitama and Tokyo metropolis.
The announcement comes after China's general customs administration published a note on the “conditional resuming the importation of water products from some regions of Japan”, restoring, “under certain conditions, the importation of some aquatic products of Japanese origin, except for aquatic products of 10 municipalities, including Fukushima”.
The AMI says that by the 22nd of this month about 193,000 imported Japanese food samples were analyzed, and about 3700 samples were collected for radionuclide tests, without any anomaly detected.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:50:46</pubDate></item><item><title>History | Defended monument to remember war with Japan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/historia-defendido-monumento-para-lembrar-guerra-com-japao/</link><description>Lin Guangzhi, director of the Institute for Social and Cultural Research of the University of Sciences and Technology of Macao, argued that a monument should be created in Macau in memory of the war martyrs with Japan, taking into account the passage in 2025 from the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people's resistance to Japanese aggression and the World War II World War.
The construction of this monument would serve for the “population to remember or know the stories of Macau during the war”. Speaking to the Citizen Journal, Li Guangzhi recalled that, although the territory was not occupied by the Japanese, the compatriots also participated in the resistance alongside the homeland, demonstrating the spirit of love for the homeland and Macao.
In addition to defending the construction of the monument, the academic also calls for the establishment of a research center in the history of the anti-Japanese war of Macao, with a view to telling positive stories about these years of conflict and combating the Japanese, as well as the contributions that were made.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:48:43</pubDate></item><item><title>PME | Requested measures to bring customers to the neighborhoods</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/pme-pedidas-medidas-para-levar-clientes-aos-bairros/</link><description>Deputy Wong Kit Cheng intends that the government explain what it will do to make small and medium -sized business (SME) get more customers with different policies such as the transformation of Macau into a gastronomic city, sports and arts and spectacle, in order to diversify the economy. The issue is part of an oral interpellation, which will be read in a session, to schedule, of the Legislative Assembly.
According to the deputy, despite various activities, such as concerts, sporting and festive gastronomy events, the economy of residential neighborhoods is not benefiting from these initiatives, which makes the SMEs difficult.
In addition, it warns the deputy, there is a risk that too homogeneous activities will be unable to mobilize visitors, which will contribute to aggravate the problem. “There are opinions in the community that while several neighborhoods periodically organize activities such as shows or cultural bazaars, they are all very homogeneous, so they do not take advantage of the historical and cultural heritage of the communities in which they are located,” he describes. "Once the activities are over, the flow of people in these neighborhoods decreases, without an effective connection with the community and traders. This shows that there is still plenty of room to improve the revitalization of the economy," he added.
Given this scenario, the deputy intends that the government explains what measures will implement so that the neighborhoods remain attractive, even after the events, and local commerce can benefit from new policies.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 05:14:11</pubDate></item><item><title>The Jacky Cheung concert</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/o-concerto-de-jacky-cheung/</link><description>Jacky Cheung (張學友), the famous Hong Kong singer presented a concert in Macao who received great criticism from which two comments stand out in particular.
First, the concert increased the casino's recipes. On average, the daily revenue of the game in May was 684 million patacas, but in the first 22 days of June, reached 14.8 billion, with a daily average of 670 million. June is unfortunately a low period of time for tourism, but the daily recipes of the game were comparable to May, which proves that the concert attracted many Jacky Cheung fans to Macao and helped the city's economy.
Jacky Cheung will make six concerts in Macau between June and July. Citibank issued a report that it is stated that Jacky Cheung concerts boosted Macao's economic development, with June's revenue from the expected 19 billion to 19.75 billion. HSBC also issued a report where it is said that the revenues of the game in June can reach values ​​between 19.7 and 20.4 billion. An international singer has the ability to bring an additional 700 million profit to Macao. This shows how Jacky Cheung is dear to his fans and the size of his charisma.
Jacky Cheung premiered in the 1980s and has been on the asset for almost 40 years. His fans grew up with him and are representatives of all age groups, young people, middle-aged people and also people from the age of Cheung. With a very wide fan base, not surprising that your concerts are always exhausted.
If Macau wants to develop the economy by attracting to its international singers, it should take into account its fan base. The higher it is, the greater the number of people moving to Macau to see the concert and the greater the economic benefits for the city. To achieve this goal, Macau may consider the possibility of offering these artists discounts on the rental of the rooms and providing fans to transport facilities to facilitate the trips of and to their places of origin; You can also organize transport so that fans visit the areas most frequented by local inhabitants and non -tourist sectors can benefit from the influx of consumers. Macau can also take this opportunity to develop activity sectors beyond the game industry, which will bring hundreds of benefits and no damage.
The second focus of the concert is the use of Cantonese and Mandarin. During the concert, fans from mainland China asked Jacky Cheung to speak Mandarin, to which he replied:
"I apologize, but I don't speak mandarin."
They then asked Jacky Cheung: "How many people speak Cantonese?"
The fans who spoke Cantonese shouted immediately "wow."
Then Jacky Cheung said in Mandarin, "Sorry, but don't. Go there, learn Cantonese."
The "wow" shouts of the fans showed that most spoke Cantonese.
Even so, Jacky Cheung sang some songs in Mandarin and the mainland China fans were very happy. In addition, Jacky Cheung's phrase, "I don't speak mandarin, go there, learn Cantonese," was halted by the cybernauts, who called him "Ambassador of Cantonese promotion" and praised him for his great emotional intelligence.
Concerts are part of the entertainment industry. As long as fans are happy, what difference makes if you use Mandarin or Cantonese? People who will watch a concert should forget the barrier of their tongue, dive into the show, enjoy each moment, integrate into the festive atmosphere and do everything to provide themselves as much happiness as possible. This is what it serves to watch a concert. Music is the common language of humanity and can eliminate barriers among people. Think about this, whenever you hear music, can we only appreciate songs sung in your own language? In addition to songs in Cantonese, we also heard songs in Mandarin, in English, Korean, Japanese, etc. By understanding this, we can break the barrier and tongue and have all fun.
In recent years, China's power has increased a lot, the economy has developed rapidly and foreign investment has also increased. Based on the principle that guides business transactions “economic interests first”, it is beginning to be common for foreign business men to use Mandarin to communicate with their Chinese partners.
In 1972, the United Nations classified the “simplified Chinese characters” as one of six “commercial languages” alongside English, French, Russian, Arabic and Spanish. All united nations official documents are written in these six languages, and April 20 was chosen as the “United Nations Chinese Language Day”. Currently, about 1.5 billion people speak Chinese around the world and the importance of this language is evident.
“Business Communication” and “necessary for state affairs” demonstrate that from a political and economic perspective, global demand for the learning of Mandarin grows from day to day. In the future, people who speak Mandarin will have an advantage when they negotiate with Chinese.

And we talk too, but in the Portugal aspect. Donald Trump decided absurd customs fares against Portugal; He wants to force Portugal as a NATO member to include spending on 5 percent expenses, something unmatched; Has already expelled Portuguese from the American territory waiting for the legality of residence; Earlier, he had expressed the little interest in the Lages base in the Azores, and even China even manifested with the Portuguese government that in the event of terminating the contract between the US and Portugal that would be interested in an agreement. Ministers Paulo Rangel and Nuno Melo of foreigners and defense respectively expressed several times that the situation in the Gaza range was unbearable with thousands of hungry children and that human rights were not being fulfilled by Israel who continues to bombard and kill Palestinians. And then?
Then came Israel's attack on Iran and the same Portuguese ministers stated that “Israel had the right to defend themselves”… And what did we see? Portugal to collaborate intrinsically in the Israelist-American attack on Iran with the active participation of 20 refueling US aircraft, who participated in the Atlantic in the refueling of the American "beasts" that bombarded several places in Iran. American. This fact led parties with a seat in the Assembly of the Republic to ask for explanations to the government of Luís Montenegro, who merely gave a tattered response.
The hypocrisy of Portugal was total. On the one hand, it condemns Israel for destroying the Gaza Strip and killing its population, when it is not even worthy to recognize the state of Palestine, and on the other hand, it allows without sketching any appeal to the parking lot of participating aircraft in the war between Israel and Iran. Where is the neutrality of a small country planted by the Atlantic that does not even have money to buy new aircraft or anti -aircraft defense material? This is total hypocrisy. Israel kills in Jordan, Syria, Gaza and Iran, but for Portuguese diplomacy everything is fine, because “you have to defend themselves”… and the people felt something was wrong. That Americans forced us to lower their pants, like what had happened when Americans attacked Iraq killing Saddam Hussein and President George Bush Jr. landed at the base of the Lages with Durão Barroso as created by orders.
Portugal is not even able to look at his neighbor Spain he decreed, as Israel attacked Iran, the end of the provision of weapons to Israel.
The policy of foreign affairs handing over to Paulo Rangel, a former exemputing who was seen in completely drunk Brussels and in the company of "friends" of dubious behavior, is the same as any taxi driver is called to the country's secret services.
Portugal is a small country, with only 10 million inhabitants, poor and dependent on the European Union money, right! But it has history and had politicians of great dignity and elevation. We had Humberto Delgado, Manuel Serra, Álvaro Cunhal, Freitas do Amaral, Mário Soares, Manuel Alegre, Sá Carneiro, Ramalho Eanes, all men who were not to bear the arrogance of whoever it was. Currently, we go to meetings in the European Union and accept all the decisions that are made, even those that may undermine the economy and quality of life of the Portuguese.
Prime Minister Luís Montenegro has just announced, after NATO's puppet meeting, that Portugal will increase its expense in defense and security. We are already seeing what will happen. Behind will be education, health, salaries, reforms. The social state will be a bullshit and with the most unprotected to be worse. And then they complain that qualified young people continue to emigrate. Why not? If in your country wages are miserable, if you have to live at home from parents until you are 30 or over years old, if they pay wide taxes, if they can't buy a house, if they can't marry and have children because the salary can't even have a blind man.
The important thing for the dominant political class is that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, leaving an incomprehensible contradiction in the air. If Pakistan, Israel and other countries can have atomic bomb why is Iran the only country that cannot enrich uranium? Simply, because Americans decide not, and Portugal and other countries dependent on Trump's maneuvered oil say Amen soon. Ai, Portugal, Portugal…</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 05:43:26</pubDate></item><item><title>The door of the stars (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/a-porta-das-estrelas-ii-2/</link><description>(Continuation of the June 19th edition)
Obviously, it is not certain that Trump succeeds in this complicated task of dividing to reign. However, it is perfectly possible for one of these actors to develop AI models or other inventions so powerful that they cannot be ignored, forcing the president to co-opt for someone else, with all the consequences that it entails.
An example could be Microsoft, which in 2024 announced a partnership with Blackrock to do exactly what Stargate should do, that is, launching a physical AI infrastructure. Thirty billion have been invested and this year will be added other eighty billion dollars. Total are one hundred and ten billion dollars, ten more than the portal of the stars. But that, for Trump, is a problem to some extent. If companies compete to earn their favors and remain faithful to American interests, the better. The big names in technology must compete fiercely with each other, producing innovation. Just don't think they are more important than the president even if they may really be.
In his monumental “sociology”, Georg Simmel distinguished between existential competition in which the life of the contenders and competition oriented to the result in which it matters is the achievement of the objective is at stake. While this type of competition prevails among the magnates of American technology, Cencelli Manual or how to share Trump's power will work. But if someone feels existentially threatened by someone else, the situation may explode.
We are evidently in the middle of Elon Musk, champion of existential risks. The founder of Spacex took just a few hours to react to the Stargate announcement. And obviously, he did in X, commenting on the publication with which OpenAi announced the birth of the project stating that "they have no money. Softbank has less than ten billion dollars, according to reliable sources. Now, even without knowing what are the reliable sources of Elon, their calculations are correct. If we subtract from the twenty -five billion of dollars of liquidity that the Masa Fund has stated in the September 2024 balance, the nominee's nineteenth -month -old one that will invest in Stargate, there are about six billion dollars in Softbank accounts.
But, as we have seen, the problem is not that. And this is not the difficulty of Elon. The founder of Spacex was actually surprised by Trump's play, which after using it throughout the election campaign as a public image, made him disappear from the scenes that matter except for the controversy that followed his supposed Roman greeting. Above all, however, the former Doge Chief (left the Trump administration and his position in Doge, the agency in charge of reducing US government spending and reducing jobs) does not tolerate that the Stargate Project is built around OpenAi, a company that musk found in 2015 and was stolen by Altman, accused by Elon of wanting money developing a general artificial intelligence (AG) capable of destroying humanity.
In a clear summary of Musk, "OpenAi is evil." The situation is paradoxical. Trump, with whom Musk has basically lived in the last three months, despises Elon's AI and attributes the operational leadership of the largest AI -related AI project to him who, according to Tesla's founder, is not simply a competitor but an existential threat to humanity survival. Consequence, a former government who, such as Musk, publicly states that Stargate is an unrealistic project, unable to finance herself and led by evil people ready to 'evoke the AI' demon 'to make money.
In this madness, the president had to hurry to declare that Elon is just a little agitated because in the project "there is a person he hates" and that, anyway, there is nothing to worry about because "I hate some people too." Altman's response to Musk, also published in the X, was almost immediate. “What is good for the country is not always good for its companies.
But I hope that, in your new position, always put the United States first. The OpenAi chief demonstrates to know Elon very well, because it hits exactly at the point where Trump America and the Musk Empire can take different ways.
For the president, the government must bet on the development of AI without any ethical, philosophical or environmental concern, because the goal is to make America big again or at least ensure that it remains greater than China.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 01:29:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Disadvantage</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/25/desassossego/</link><description>No one supports the morning birds when Alba comes to start the day, which the day always happens, only the night seems to us the first of our lives, and the ones we now transpite, so small, even seem betrayals.
We are in the Summer Solstice, and we, those who get older, are catapulted by exuberant energy that we do not know how to follow the same flash as the abundance of this flow rather than resurrection causes prostration. In fact, there is no greater threat than all that rises in sound, sensation, meaning and lust- nothing shuts down, empties, soothes, Fenece- the contrary, everything imitates sound, reproduces, replica, multiply, and for those who await the exit, such exuberance may be demolishing.
"To live is to be another" unlover: but what another supplies what we have been to be henceforth? No one responds to this. We are others without realizing that things were once loved with sense, and that we still have to cross the time loaded with others who finish us until we are nothing. To summer and those who will come, we must look at them as light of the world, interpret their abundances, and not succumb to the domain of the emptying permanence.
- No one remembers having been dead, but we remember well what it was to be alive- We were calculated with the book of the disaste, enchanted and goose bumps to the soul, which we all recognize that alluvion of extremely lucid and absurd, and some still dive into the final dissolution as in those Woody Allen movies when I stopped the middle of the morning race with the frustrating sensation to die. What is it for then to run or stand still? It is possible that only a large neurathnic know how to produce withdrawal and reflection, and that everything else is a reality as parallel as it is paralyzing to see by the effects produced.
The impermanence of living leads to long reflections that only the most permanent dare to do, but they are not testimonies of the Gregaria existence of the toil to overcome the abullious states of the others, that without a reserve of subtle slavery they would know nothing, and we will flow into the elaboration of what is necessary to be human in the midst of this profile- a stunning degree of thought- that a humanity that drags on its existence. Pilling and sabotaging everything around in a primitive fear of starving, this one will never experience such delights.
Hunger has various meanings, which its obscure condition is preparing for the cannibal phase where the ogres of the world is already being disliked by giving human pieces to lie in the dumps of disassass mutual all those who will swallow. But all of this seems to be a finitude that it is about, and what we see is the euphoria to end up with trepidation spheres where all the tomorrows that sing will be extinguished. This ordinary evil is so paralyzing that it is on a collision route even with the need.
"The heart, if you could think, would stop," here is a disadvantage; And what more? If the brain could feel, it would think; This is a grateful task for mismatched organs. If we could guess with the body we would be capturing and premonitory in the succession line of happy sources, but not even that life has given us so that we can pacify ourselves in solution and art. We have been embarrassed by the tribal frenzy and competed as crazy for a place in the sun that will erase in the big nuclear winter, and when we are in the caves of the story watching the long programmed of a passionate and crazy species, maybe tears come to our help. Now we are just crazy, cold crazy, the most dark way you can produce monsters in your strength. It is disarmed that we had built this nursery of trepidation with so much formal contempt to the laws of love, but this is what we did. A amalgam of lives that are delirious trembling, which sleep with open eyes, have sarcastic and injured delights, and forge martyrons that they are unaware of the consequences.
Sustainability is a very vast area, and no feature or source gives us the harmony somewhat dreamed, and will still come a quiet as well as the disaster of this invented joy.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Cinematheque | Children's Film Festival until August</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/cinemateca-festival-de-cinema-infantil-ate-agosto/</link><description>July and August are months of the calendar stored for this year's edition of the Macao International Film Festival, with exhibitions at Cinemateca Paixão. The initiative, from the Cultural Institute, is part of the program of the Macao Arts Festival and brings the great classics to childhood, such as “Aladino” or “King Lion”
 
Summer is there and with it also the great children's cinema classics that marked generations, first parents, and now the children. These are these classics that are part of this year's edition of the Macao International Film Festival of Macao, integrated at the Macao Arts Festival, which runs throughout this July and August at Cinemateca Paixão.
This initiative of the Cultural Institute (IC) intends to bring the little movie theaters and reveal to them stories full of emotion and fantasy, many of them made at a time when mobile phones were not yet a reality. In this which is the second edition of the festival, also dedicated to the “big spirit with a young spirit”, are filmed films in various sections, being possible to see or review “Aladino”, “The Lion King”, “Cinderella” or more recent titles “George the Curious”, “Happy Feet” or “Paddington in Peru”, among many others.
In one of the festival sections, entitled “Cinematographic Transformations”, includes a selection of films adapted from children's and illustrated books; Or the “Classics for All Children” section featuring “original animations such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, allowing the newest to relive the charm of classic stories,” describes the IC.
Within the classics, “The Lion King” is shown on July 27 from 15h and brings a post-exhibition conversation. Although this movie has a more recent edition, it is the 1994 version that will be screened at Cinemateca, full of the emotions of young Lion Simba fighting his uncle Scar, ambitious and evil that leads him to believe that he was responsible for his father's death. However, Scar just wants to lead the kingdom. In this fight, Simba grows up, falls in love and gets two friends, Timon and Pumba. These characters are eventually ended up being integrated in other animation projects.
On the same day, but at 11am, it is the turn to see "Aladino", the man of the flying carpet, the story made in the 1990s that will be analyzed in a post-exhibition conversation. Within the classics, on July 20 there is an old version of the “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”, in this case of 1937, when Cinderella tries to escape the stepmother and the bad and ugly sister, in search of her enchanted prince.
The latest
In a more contemporary wave, Cinematic Passion shows “Paddington in the Amazon”, last year's film, in a version that has folding in Cantonese. The screening takes place Saturday, July 26, and reveals the story of the bear that loves marmalade and is lost in the jungle, "in an exciting and dangers adventure."
Already this Saturday, will be displayed some shorts of animation, from 15h. This is the case of "George, the Curious," where "the explorer Ted, the yellow hat man, travels to Africa in the hope of recovering an important artifact to his friend Bloomsberry, director of a museum." However, he eventually meets George, a “restless monkey” who hides on the ship that brings Ted back to New York. It is then that a series of adventures of a monkey in the middle of the city are beginning. That same afternoon it is displayed "OCD, OCD! Small animals are calling".
On Sunday, the 6th, this last short is shown again, next to "Where the Monsters Live." From 11am it is possible to know the story of "Max", a "tracker and sensitive boy who feels misunderstood at home and escapes where the monsters live." It is then that he comes to an "island where he knows mysterious and strange creatures, with such wild and unpredictable emotions as his behaviors," "monsters yearn for a leader who guides them, just as Max wants to have a kingdom to command." "However, he quickly realizes that governor is not that simple, and that relationships in this new world are more complicated than he imagined," adds the synopsis of this production.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:27:23</pubDate></item><item><title>Spanish cultivates tea in Minho and brings Portuguese food to Beijing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/espanhol-cultiva-cha-no-minho-e-traz-comida-portuguesa-para-pequim/</link><description>João Pimenta's report from Lusa Agency
At the end of almost three decades based in China, the cooking and Spanish businessman Carlos Miranda decided to try “something different”: cultivating tea in the north of Portugal and bringing Portuguese cuisine to Beijing.
"It is necessary to innovate," the businessman told Lusa, during a break at the Portuguese restaurant Calm, who inaugurated this year in the Chinese capital.
Sitting in a room attached to the establishment, Carlos Miranda prepares green tea on a traditional Chinese table. "Tea always fascinated me," he said. "I never drank coffee," he added.
In the corner of the table is a prescription book - the kitchen of Macau from my grandfather's house - published in 1992, by Graça Pacheco Jorge. Descendant of a family established in the territory since the seventeenth century, the author was a central figure in the dissemination of Macanese cuisine.
Carlos Miranda also is linked to Portugal of family origin, through a Portuguese-grandmother. “My family is from Zamora, in the northern interior of Spain, but I have family members in Lisbon,” he said.
With about 200 square meters and place for 40 people, the Portuguese restaurant is in the heart of Beijing's diplomatic zone, north of Sanlitun, one of the busiest and most cosmopolitan areas of the Chinese capital. The menu includes: Codfish to Brás, Lagareiro Octopus, Cabyla rice, seafood rice or duck rice. “Rice is attractive to the Chinese,” he said.
On the other hand
In the opposite direction, Miranda took to the north of Portugal tea, a drink originated in China for thousands of years. “I wanted to do something linked to ecological agriculture,” he said.
The agricultural project began about a year ago in the Minho region, in land near the Peneda-Gerês National Park. "The idea was to plant in the park, but as it is national ecological reserve it became impossible. I was on the slopes," said the businessman, praising the local conditions of moisture, altitude and soil.
"North Portugal is humid, has clean rivers and, in the last analysis, was the European country where, in a recent study, tea revealed better concentration of antioxidants," he said.
The first sheets will take time: "Only after four or five years can you start to spoon with quality."
The plantation was designed for a niche market, focused on biological and proximity product. "It makes no sense to compete with China or India. Let's do gourmet tea, with zero pesticide guarantee, for demanding consumers," he said.
Although he never worked directly in the tea industry, Carlos Miranda is an enthusiast. “I drink tea every day,” he confessed. While waiting for the first harvest in Minho, Carlos Miranda already serves the other side of the world Vinhos do Douro and Dão. "We have to do different things, not always be for the same," he said.
With history
In China, the Spaniard has built a career in restoration over 27 years, with several establishments that have become a reference among the expats community in the country.
"I am a training cook. I worked in Porto and Lisbon in the 1990s, and then I came to China. I had restaurants in Beijing, Liaoning, Dalian and Xiamen, when there was no western food in these cities," he said.
Calm down works with a team that knows Miranda's course well: "Chinese chief cooking has been with me for 20 years." Clients include Chinese Portuguese -speaking students and Chinese diplomats and professionals who lived in Lusophone countries: “I met very interesting people here.”
The agricultural project now forces you to spend more time in Portugal. "Tea requires care. In January we will build a small factory to process the product." Until then, get over and await. “It's a slow process, but that's what makes it interesting,” he concludes.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 05:41:00</pubDate></item><item><title>“Macao Art” | UNG Project Vai Meng is a finalist for the Biennial</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/arte-macau-projecto-de-ung-vai-meng-e-finalista-para-a-bienal/</link><description>Guilherme Ung Vai Meng, former president of the Cultural Institute, curates one of the six finalist projects to participate in the next edition of “Macau Art: International Art Biennial of Macau 2025”.

The Director of Tourism Services argues that the challenges of reducing tourist spending should be fought with new tourist products and cultural experiences
 
After the end of border restrictions due to the fight against pandemic, a phenomenon was born in China entitled “Special Forces Tourist”, which designates visitors who “pick the point” in the largest number of tourist spots in the shortest possible time. The main objective of “operations” is to feed social networks, spending as little money as possible.
The Director of Tourism Services (STD), Helena de Senna Fernandes, addressed the theme, in a series of government representatives to a delegation of journalists from the Great Bay. Speaking cited by the HK01 portal, the official admitted that in the face of economic retraction, tourist consumption estimates were reviewed, but ensured that Macau receives all visitors equally regardless of purchase capacity. However, to circumvent the current challenges, Senna Fernandes stresses that new ideas are needed, which encourages tourists, even if they visit Macao for a few hours just to take a memory of the territory. "We have to provide options to all types of tourists, from products from small neighborhood stores, to luxury experiences, and offer various consumption scenarios for all scholarships," said the official.
The STD leader points to the cultural area as a way to boost tourists consumption, with the organization of concerts and promotion of creative industries for tourists, such as memories.
Sleep here and there
Tourism of “Special Forces” originated controversy in Hong Kong, with the dissemination of tourist photographs staying overnight in the neighboring region's macdonald's, as well as at the airport. The same thing happened in Macao, with the sharing on the social networks of tourists sleeping in the lawn adjacent to Wynn Palace.
Despite the trend, Helena de Senna Fernandes stressed that the tourism sector shows a good evolution. Last year, more than 34.9 million people visited Macau, about 90 percent of the level before the pandemic. In the first five months of this year, more than 16 million tourists visited the territory, with the hotel occupation around 90 percent. In annual terms, the STD director expects this year's number of visitors to reach 39 million.
In the first quarter of this year, the average spending of tourists who visited Macao fell again, with a reduction of 13.2 percent in annual terms, part of the increase in tour, which represented almost 60 percent of entries in the first three months of the year.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:05:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Unemployment | More residents with work in three months</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/desemprego-mais-residentes-com-trabalho-em-tres-meses/</link><description>Data from the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) reveal that there are more residents employed within three months, and the percentage of unemployed residents looking for the first job has dropped. These numbers, released yesterday, concern the months of March to May, compared to the quarter corresponding to February to April this year.
Thus, from March to May, there were 282,200 employees in Macao, 300 people, and it was found that "the number of residents in the construction industry has grown."
However, "the number of residents employed in the financial activities have decreased." In addition, the number of unemployed residents looking for the first employment represented 8.4 percent of all unemployed residents, minus 1.8 percentage points compared to the preceding period.
Already the number of unemployed residents, was 7,200, and "most of those looking for a new job worked before in the branches of retail, construction and bullies or other betting games."
In general terms, the unemployment rate from March to May was 1.9 percent, while the resident's unemployment rate was 2.5 percent, "both identical to those last period (February to April)." The active population, including residents and non -resident workers, was 380,200 people, less 400; In addition, the population employed, 373,000, lowered in 200 people, both cases compared to February to April.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:03:23</pubDate></item><item><title>MICE | Government and CPSP organize lecture</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/mice-governo-e-cpsp-organizam-palestra/</link><description>Last Thursday, the Institute for the Promotion of Commerce and Investment (IPIM), the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) and the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) gave a lecture on the hiring and management of Personnel for the Macao Convention and Exhibition Sector (MICE).

Macao companies and families have hired more than three thousand workers not resident in the last 12 months, it was released yesterday.
According to data from the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP), in late May, Macau had 183,783 workers without resident status, more 3,006 than in the same month as 2024. The labor from abroad, including from mainland China, reached the highest value since June 2020 at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Since the maximum peak of 196,538, reached in late 2019, before the pandemic, and until January 2023, the city lost almost 45,000 non-residents, which corresponded to 11.3 percent of the active population.
In January 2023, when the end of the Zero Covid policy, which was in force in Macao and mainland China for almost more than three years, Macau had less than 152,000 migrants, the lowest number since April 2014.
The statistics, released by the Directorate of Services for Laboral Affairs, reveal that, since the end of the Zero Covid policy, the number of non-resident workers increased on 31.905. The hotel and restoration sector was the one that has hired the most in the last 12 months, gaining 3,379 non-resident workers, followed by that of domestic employees (another 1,553).
The hotel area and the restoration had been precisely the most affected by loss of labor during the pandemic, having faced more than 17,600 non-resident employees since December 2019.
High visitors
The city received, in 2024, 34.9 million visitors, 23.8 percent more than the previous year, but still far from the record, 39.4 million, set in 2019, before the pandemic. Hotel establishments, on the other hand, welcomed more than 14.4 million guests, a new historical record.
The economic crisis created by the pandemic led the unemployment rate to reach 4 percent in the third quarter of 2022, the highest since 2006. Despite the number of non-resident workers, the unemployment rate remained 1.9 percent between February and April.
Still, several deputies have asked the government to force the six game dealers to say goodbye to the labor from abroad to ensure the use of the 5,600 local workers working in the 11 satellite casinos that will end by the end of 2025.
Three of the six dealers-SJM, Galaxy and Melco-communicated to the authorities on June 9, which will end by December 31 the exploration of the 11 existing satellite casinos in the territory. The 'satellite casinos' are managed by other companies, being an inheritance of the Portuguese administration, which already existed before the game's liberalization in 2002.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:00:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism | STD promoted Macau in Hong Kong on the weekend</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/turismo-dst-promoveu-macau-em-hong-kong-no-fim-de-semana/</link><description>The Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) made a promotion action in Hong Kong, on Saturday and Sunday, to attract tourists from the neighboring region.

In Brazil there are “only four cities” recognized as creative cities in gastronomy of the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO) and “They will all be here,” said the Director of Tourism Services (STD).
At a press conference, Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes said that "the event will gather 34 of the 56 UNESCO creative cities in gastronomy from 21 countries distributed on six continents." The leader regretted that the city of Santa Maria da Feira, in Portugal, decided not to join the festival.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us his wife and daughter (cf. Recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: High there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist.

Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as António Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter My Dear Friend: You are a pure, excellent, and very noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts him a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people, which always seems the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

Before hundreds of faithful and monks gathered at the McLeod Ganj's main temple in northern India, the Tibetan spiritual leader and the Nobel Prize for Peace has committed to “serving humanity” not only personally, but through the entity that represents, in a beam veiled to the continuity of spiritual lineage.
The Tibetan leader's statement took place during a Tenshug, an elaborate long -life offering ceremony organized this year by the Dhomey Province community. Using the traditional Pandita ceremonial yellow hat, Dalai Lama received, for about two hours, offerings from a long procession of devotees praying for their longevity.
At the age of 89, Dalai Lama has lived in India since 1959, the year he fled the Tibeta after a failed revolt against the Chinese occupation. Since then, it leads the Tibetan administration in exile, from the Indian city of Dharamshala, defending the autonomy of Tibet and the preservation of its culture.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Hong Kong promotes in Portugal technology in the construction of public housing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/hong-kong-promove-em-portugal-tecnologia-na-construcao-de-habitacao-publica/</link><description>The Hong Kong government announced yesterday that it will promote in Portugal the use of technology in the construction of public housing. According to a statement, Hong Kong authorities will organize in Portugal on Thursday a business lunch entitled “Unraveling New Horizons: accessible housing and opportunities in Hong Kong and the Great Bay”.
The Commissioner for the Development of the Great Bay, Maisie Chan Kit Ling, will make a speech about “the huge business opportunities” that the regional project offers to Portuguese entrepreneurs.
At the event will “share Hong Kong's experiences in increasing quantity, speed, efficiency and quality of public housing construction through the adoption of various innovative rapid and robotic construction technologies”. Hong Kong's secretary for housing, Winnie Ho Wing Yin, invited more than 20 representatives of the region's construction sector and mainland China to participate in the event.
These companies will talk about technologies such as prefabricated modules, the integration of mechanical, electrical and channeling facilities, and the use of robots in construction. The event may serve “to strengthen links between the sectors of Hong Kong and Portugal and explore business opportunities”, it underlines in the statement.
Ongoing
Also Maisie Chan and Winnie Ho will still participate in the 17th International Forum on Urbanism, which will take place between July 1st and 4th, in the renewed Pavilion of Portugal, which, after the works carried out by architect Siza Vieira, was transferred to the University of Lisbon.
The political program of the new Portuguese government, led by Luís Montenegro, provides for the construction of 59,000 public houses by 2030 and financing for more housing, including public-private partnerships in the State Real estate.
On June 17, the prime minister admitted to Parliament that the previous goal, to build 26,000 public houses by 2026, had "a difficult execution," but refused to be "defeatist and pessimistic." "I think we still have the ability to stimulate construction in the public sector," said Montenegro, pointing out that "the execution rate is now increasing."
"We have an execution fee in the universe of these 26 thousand houses of 27 percent and, according to the information that the municipalities have transmitted us by the end of June, 13,429 dwellings will be ready in this program," he said.
The prime minister also considered that it was necessary to exceed “administrative and bureaucratic blocks” that delayed the construction of new houses.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:31:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Industry | Activity retreats for the third consecutive month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/industria-actividade-recua-pelo-terceiro-mes-consecutivo/</link><description>The activity in the transformative sector of China retreated in June for the third consecutive month, although at a less pronounced pace, according to data released yesterday by the National Statistics Office (GNE) of the Asian country.
The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), the main indicator of the sector, was set at 49.7 points, above the 49.5 recorded in May, in line with the predictions of most analysts.
A value below 50 points represents a contraction of the activity compared to the previous month, while values ​​above signal growth.
Of the five subsidies that make up the PMI of the transforming industry, those related to production, new orders-key indicator of demand-and delivery times remained above the growth line, unlike raw material and employment inventories, which continued in contraction zone.
The GNE Zhao Qinghe statistical precisely highlighted the recovery “either of production or demand”, with reference to sectors such as food and special machinery, although it has underlines “insufficient market atcivity” in other areas, such as non -metallic minerals or foundry metal casting and lamination.
In a report, British consultant Capital Economics noted that June data suggest that the Chinese economy "has gaining some impetus again." The subindex of new export orders rose from 47.5 to 47.7 points, the third consecutive monthly increase, although still in negative territory.
This performance “probably reflects an increase in US demand after the 90 -day commercial truce” began between the two countries in mid -May, analyst Zichun Huang pointed out.
Huang warned, however, with “persistent deflationist pressure” in the Chinese economy, with production prices accelerating in June, but remaining “at low levels”. The GNE also released the PMI of non -manufacturing sectors - Services and Construction - which rose from 50.3 in May to 50.5 points in June, exceeding analysts' expectations.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Chinese communist party exceeds 100 million members</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/partido-comunista-chines-ultrapassa-os-100-milhoes-de-membros/</link><description>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exceeded the 100 million members in late 2024, according to a report yesterday released, in a context marked by more than a decade of campaign against corruption between their paintings.
The number of affiliates rises to 100.27 million -in a country with about 1,400 million inhabitants -an increase of 2.13 million compared to the end of 2023, indicated the organization department of the CCP Central Committee, on the 104th anniversary of the party's foundation, which is marked on Tuesday.
"CCP affiliation has continuously increased, while its structure continues to improve and base organizations - currently at 5.2 million - reinforce," says the report, quoted by the state press.
The educational profile of the members has also evolved: almost 57 percent have university or higher education, the document revealed.
The number of women continues to grow, totaling 31 million affiliates (30.9 percent), and the average age of new members has diminished, with 83.7 percent of adhesions in 2024 to correspond to people 35 or less.
The report also indicates that the proportion of members from ethnic minorities remained at 7.7 percent recorded the previous year.
The party stressed that it maintains a focus on internal supervision and self -government, applying “the spirit of reform and strict standards”, and recorded an increase of 16.5 percent in the number of pictures that received specific training in 2024.
Largest in the world
Founded in clandestinity, the CCP is now considered the largest party in the world and exerts a transverse influence on China's political, economic and social life, with patriotic content linked to its history to emerge even in national university access exams.
China's party general secretary and president, Xi Jinping, yesterday chaired a meeting of the Central Committee Politburo, in which new rules were discussed to “improve” the functioning of deliberation, coordination and decision-making organisms.
"At the meeting, the importance of avoiding formalism and bureaucratization was underlined, with a view to achieving concrete results," said the official news agency Xinhua.
These principles join the repeated appeals to austerity by the party leadership, as part of the 2012 anti-corruption campaign in 2012, which has already resulted in the condemnation of dozens of corruption, including former ministers and leaders of companies and state organizations.
In January, Xi again asked for a "resolute victory in the hard and prolonged battle against corruption", which he classified as "the biggest threat" to the party.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:18:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Travel | Chinese mne starts for a ride through Europe to strengthen ties</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/viagem-mne-chines-inicia-periplo-pela-europa-para-estreitar-lacos/</link><description>Following the trade war launched by US administration, Wang Yi moves to Brussels, Paris and Berlin, in order to reinforce cooperation between China and the Old Continent
 
Chinese diplomacy chief Wang Yi yesterday began a tour of Europe, with the aim of transforming the relationship between China and the European Union (EU) into a pillar of "stability," compared to US pressure.
The prominent figure of Chinese diplomacy, Wang Yi, 71, has been planning to move to Brussels, headquarters of the EU, as well as France and Germany. The visit takes place at a time when China seeks to strengthen ties with the European continent, before the growing tension with the United States, led by Donald Trump, who repeatedly classifies Beijing as a strategic rival.
Despite the approach, divergences persist between Brussels and Beijing, namely in the economic domain: the EU massive commercial deficit of China (304 billion euros), the partnership between Beijing and Moscow Despite the war in Ukraine, European tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and Chinese retaliation aimed at the French brandy.
"Sino-European relations face important opportunities, at a time when the world is going through rapid historical transformations, with the unsettling growth of hegemonic unilateralism, protectionism and behaviors," Chinese diplomacy spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Friday in an implicit critique of the US and trade war.
In this context, China and EU should “jointly preserve global peace and stability, defend multilateralism and free trade, safeguard international rules, equity and justice, and affirm itself as stabilizing and constructive forces in a turbulent world,” he added.
High Level Meetings
In Brussels, Wang Yi is expected to meet with the new head of European diplomacy, Kaja Kallas, for a “high-level strategic dialogue,” according to Chinese authorities.
In Germany, the minister will meet the homologist, Johann Wadephul, to address diplomacy and security topics. This will be Wang Yi's first visit since the formation of a new conservative government in Berlin last May. In France, Wang will meet with Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, who visited China in March.
The war in Ukraine should master part of the conversations. China has been appealed to peace negotiations and respect for the territorial integrity of states - alluding to Ukraine - but avoids condemning Russia and deepened Moscow ties since the invasion in February 2022 in the commercial, diplomatic and military areas.
Such a position has been valid to Beijing criticism from Europeans, who accuse China to offer essential economic support to the Russian war effort.
Business relations between China and EU have deteriorated in recent years, with Brussels to denounce unfair economic practices by Beijing. The tension intensified last year with the imposition by the EU of additional tariffs on Chinese electric cars. In retaliation, China aimed at the French brandy.
The European Commission decided two weeks ago to exclude Chinese public tenders in the area of ​​medical equipment more than five million euros, invoking similar restrictions on European firms in China. Beijing reacted, accusing Brussels of applying a system of "two weights, two measures."
Another point of friction is the so -called “rare lands”. Since April, Chinese authorities have required licenses for exporting these strategic metals used in products such as mobile phones or electric car batteries. The issuance of these authorizations has been, according to the European, limited and slow auto industry.
In response, Beijing proposed in June that the creation of a “green channel” that allows priority access to rare land to the European market.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:17:15</pubDate></item><item><title>India | Alleged violation in a group of university student rekindles alarms</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/india-alegada-violacao-em-grupo-de-estudante-universitaria-reacende-alarmes/</link><description>The alleged collective violation of a student at a university in Calcutta rekindled Friday about sexual violence in India, a persistent phenomenon that generates political and social tensions in the country again.
According to the Indian local agency Ani, a student reported being assaulted last Tuesday inside the university 'campus' in the city of the country, and police had three people related to the case, asking to proceed with the investigation.
The National Commission for Women (NCW) of India became aware of the case and requested an urgent report from the authorities. The case triggered a political dispute between the government party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the regional party in the Allmool Congress (AITC) power of the opposition.
Narendra Modi's BJP accused the state government of inaction, while AITC, in a statement, defended the police action and renewed the appeal to implement the “aparajita” anti-viking law, according to the central executive, and which aims to accelerate lawsuits for sexual crimes and harden the penalties.
Small groups of women and activists gathered in front of the university's campus to demand justice and greater protection for women, in a context marked by increasing concern for safety in educational and work spaces.
This complaint coincides with the discovery, also on Friday, of the buried body of a woman in the state of Haryana, in the north of the country, allegedly violated and murdered by father-in-law in April, according to the Indian channel NDTV, another case of brutal sexual violence in the country.
Both episodes are known almost a year after the murder of a doctor in a Calcutta hospital, a crime that triggered a wave of national indignation and returned to question the response of the judicial system to cases of gender violence in the most populous country in the world.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 05:47:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | League of Social Democrats announces dissolution</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/hong-kong-liga-dos-sociais-democratas-anuncia-dissolucao/</link><description>The Social Democrats League (LSD), one of the last opposition parties left in Hong Kong, announced its dissolution on Friday. The party was founded in 2006 and was considered the radical faction of the Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Movement. He was known for his street campaigns, often led by the now-arrested activist Leung Kwok-Hung.
"Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the Social Democrats League. However, we will not survive until that day and we will announce our dissolution," the party said in a message to journalists.
The movement has always fought more democracy in Hong Kong and defended causes that affect its citizens, criticizing social and economic inequality in a city with one of the largest rich disparities in the world. At its peak, the party occupied three places on the Hong Kong Legislative Council. His decline began when Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020 after huge protests the previous year.
China and the Hong Kong government claimed that the law was necessary to contain political agitation. Member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council from 2004 to 2017, the leader of the Social Democratic League, Leung Kwok-Hung, was first arrested in 2021.
Together with 44 other pro-democracy activists, he was sentenced last year to six years and nine months in prison for endangering national security, triggering a wave of international protests.
The party has been conducting small protests in recent years, often under strong police surveillance. Four members of the movement, including their current leader, Chan Po-Ying, were fined in June for wearing black clothing and raising “unauthorized” money in street campaigns.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 05:45:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Shenzhou-20 | Chinese astronauts complete second space walk</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/shenzhou-20-astronautas-chineses-completam-segunda-caminhada-espacial/</link><description>The astronauts of the Chinese mission Shenzhou-20 held their second activity outside the Tiangong space station, the China's manned space flight agency said Friday Friday Friday.
Chen Dong and Chen Zhongruui went abroad from the central module of the station, where they remained about six and a half hours, while the third member of the Wang Jie crew collaborated from the interior.
The operation was supported by Tiangong's robotic arm and the terrestrial control team, indicated the same source. The Shenzhou-20 Mission was launched in April from the Jiuquan base in northwestern China and the crew will remain in orbit for approximately six months.
During this period, the three astronauts will conduct scientific experiments, technical tests and new extra vehicle activities. Tiangong space station orbits about 400 kilometers from Earth and was designed to operate for at least a decade.
With the expected end of the International Space Station, led by the United States and from which China was excluded, Tiangong could be briefly in the only space station in operation.
China has invested heavily in the space program in recent years, having already managed to land the Chang'e 4 probe on the hidden side of the moon-a world debut-and send a mission to Mars, becoming the third country, after the United States and the former Soviet Union, being able to land on the red planet.

The agreement was signed after negotiations in London
 
China and the United States have agreed on the terms of the pact signed in the last round of negotiations held in London, the China Ministry of Commerce announced Friday after months of a tariff war.
"After negotiations in London, the Chinese and American teams maintained a close communication. Recently, with the approval, both parties confirmed the details of the agreement," a spokesman said Friday on the official portal of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.
“We signed with China yesterday [Thursday], right? We just signed with China,” said US President Donald Trump earlier, during an event at the White House, not providing further details about the deal.
According to the document released by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, “China will analyze and approve the export requests of controlled goods that comply with the conditions provided for by law”, in an apparent reference to the rare lands, essential minerals for sectors such as defense and automobile, whose production is controlled by China, which imposed restrictions on its sale abroad in early April.
In return, the US Trade Department said “the United States will cancel a series of restrictive measures adopted against China” without providing details.
"The United States and China are expected to find a commitment and meet the important consensus and the demands achieved by the heads of state on June 5," the statement stressed, referring to telephone conversation between the US and China presidents, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, who has unlocked the situation and allowed commercial representatives of both powers to meet in London.
London Agreement
China thus confirms Trump's statements, which revealed that the United States had signed the deal with China the day before.
In mid-June, after two days of negotiations in the British capital, the Republican leader indicated that the deal included a 55 percent US fare on Chinese products and a 10 percent tariff over American products to China.
The London Agreement provided for the establishment of a structure to implement the "consensus" reached by Xi and Trump in that telephone conversation, although it was still pending the final approval of both leaders for their signature.
This round of negotiations sought to relieve tensions between the two powers, after having accused themselves to violate an agreement signed in Geneva, Switzerland in May. This agreement had started a 90-day commercial truce, according to which China would reduce its tariffs on US products from 125 percent to 10 percent, while the US would reduce tariffs on 145 percent Chinese products to 30 percent.
China claimed, at the time, that the US violated the truce by restricting the export of artificial intelligence chips (AI), suspending sales of software to semiconductor design and threatening to revoke the visas of Chinese students. Washington believed that Beijing was not honoring the pact due to the restrictions previously referred to for rare land exports.
Climbing
After his return to the White House, Trump intensified the trade war he had already started in 2018, launching a tariff climbing against China that resulted in practice in a kind of commercial embargo among the two largest economic powers in the world. The US even imposed tariffs up to 145 percent to China, which responded with 125 percent tariffs on US products.
The US president also said Friday that the United States are "receiving great offers" from other governments and suggested that the next country with which one can reach an agreement is India. "We have one on the way, perhaps with India, a very big deal," said Trump.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 05:29:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, Academic: “China is a reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended at the University of Aveiro the doctoral thesis that analyzes how China has been positioned in recent decades as an important actor in the “global health governance”. Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I highlight that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is no different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that the willingness already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy.
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages ​​in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary-general guaranteed to have "all the pleasure of working with all parties," but stressed that this is a "decision that is up to the central governments to make" and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, it is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new fund's new direction "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, in this case, the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibilization of the rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish-speaking institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo. In an interview with HM, the author unravels some secrets about the poet's life in Macau, a period of relative calm in the middle of a almost always turbulent life
 
Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything that someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the appropriate place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macao, Camões has been poorly used in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>FIA | Conference helped perceive future of motorsport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/13/fia-conferencia-ajudou-a-perceber-futuro-do-automobilismo/</link><description>For the first time in its history, in 2025, Macau welcomed the Extraordinary General Assemblies and Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). Organized in partnership with the Macau-China General Association (AAMC), the FIA-affiliated sports territory, and Galaxy Entertainment Group, this event brought together more than five dozen FIA senior delegates from 147 countries in the field.
 
In the Galaxy International Convention Center, to this day, the future of motoring and mobility worldwide is discussed. However, some details about the future of sport in the territory have already been revealed between the lines. Focused on obtaining information about the growth of motorsport and promoting safe, sustainable and accessible mobility to everyone in the Asia Pacific region, the FIA ​​conference opening session highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration, as well as the region's ability to innovate and create solutions that respond to specific questions it faces.
Roberto Carlos Osório, president of the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), said the association has a strong tradition in motor racing and that following FIA's guidelines is being able to grow rapidly competition at the base level in the region.
“We organized the first GT Macau Cup in 2008,” said the AAMC leader. "Currently, we also have the GT Cup - Great Bay Race for GT4 cars. In addition, in 2008, we created Road Sport Challenge," he explained. “And today, in 2025, we are proud to announce that we have 68 tourism cars in the region to compete in the qualification race to enter the 72nd Macao Grand Prix.”
In a year when AAMC celebrates 30 years of existence - was born as Macao Automobile Club - we also learned that the association's bet for the future will be in the basic disciplines of motor sport. Roberto Carlos Osorio also revealed a curious fact: Macau has 135 pilots with sports license from the territory.
“This growth was achieved following FIA's guidelines to promote grassroots motorsport and create accessible races for riders in the region,” added the manager of the territory. “With the interest of pilots, teams and promoters in developing state-of-the-art activities in Macau, we will focus even more on base competitions and affordable races, not only to support tourism, but also to make Macau in a Karting international center of international events, where champions can be selected for F4 and, later, for regional formula.”
Confirmed GP program
The Macao Grand Prix Organizing Committee (COGPM) held a press conference on June 8 at the Macao Grand Prix Museum to confirm the 72nd Macao Grand Program races, which will take place from November 13 to 16 this year.
As last year, there will be seven races in total, respectively, the Macao Grand Prix - FR da Fia World Cup, the GT Macau Cup - GT da Fia World Cup, the Macau Guide Race - Kumho Fia tcr World Tour Event of Macau, the Formula 4 Formula 4 World Cup, the 57th Macao Motor Motor Prize, GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge. For the first time, the guide circuit receives four different cups under the FIA ​​seal on the same weekend.
Other news
Between meetings and communications, other information was revealed about the November edition of the Macao Grand Prix. The FIA ​​World Council approved in Macao that the winner of the first Formula 4 World Cup of the FIA ​​will receive two points for the super license. We have also noticed that Pirelli will equip all the monologes that participate in both the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup and the FIA ​​regional formula World Formula Cup. In turn, the supply of tires and fuel to the FIA ​​GT World Cup remains in the contest phase.
Registration for the Formula 4 World Cup will be open until July 30. The final selection of 20 pilots will be confirmed by the FIA ​​through an official invitation letter, taking into account the current classification of the pilots in the respective championships.
In the case of the FIA ​​Regional Formula World Cup, registrations will also remain open until July 30, and the grill will be able to host a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula -equipped with alpha Romeo engines built by the autotechnic. As with Formula 4, participation will be by invitation, with priority assigned to pilots who have reached the best positions in the five regional formula championships of 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-13 18:43:57</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Jaguar that won in Macau in 1984 returned to the tracks</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/06/gp-jaguar-que-venceu-em-macau-em-1984-regressou-as-pistas/</link><description>The more than seventy years of history of the Macau Grand Prix are people, machines and great moments. We were in 1984, when Tom Walkinshaw won Jaguar's only victory in the guide race. After years away from the audience, for the affected man, this same car returned to the tracks at the hands of an enthusiast of the MSAR MOTOR EVENT
 
Richard Meins, an English maritime transport entrepreneur who lived many years in Hong Kong, who participated on several occasions at the Macao Grand Prix, led this Jaguar XJs of Group A in the Historic Touring Car Challenge race, a competition for classics during the Donington Historic Festival. This “Big Cat”, Chassis No. 5 and one of the four original XJs still existing, is practically as it was in 1984, but given the limitations of tobacco advertising, today boasts the colors used in the European Tourism Championship, instead of the iconic black and gold decoration of John Player Special (JPS) that marked the ticket through the guide circuit.
Interestingly, this return to the clues, from a car that has been still in New Zealand and Japan, was scheduled for the Algarve International Race Track, but the Historic Touring Car Challenge canceled its race in early April in Portimão. So it was in lands of his majesty that Richard Meins made his first race with the British car.
“The car won in Macao in 1984, so I'm a big fan of this model,” Ricard Meins told the English magazine Motorsport News. “I still have the photographs I took this weekend in Macao,” said this avid classic competition car collector who, besides driving, supported several riders at the Macao Grand Prix.
In Donington Park, Richard Meins shared the imposing Jaguar XJS, equipped with a 5.3 -liter V12 engine with Jack Tetley, and ended in sixth place, winning in his class. Richard Meins had only guided the car once or twice, but plans to participate in more historic touring car challenge rounds with XJS 1984. “Let's try to put it on track more often now,” Ricard Meins said, who revealed that he was a stake in the Silverstone Festival in August with this very rare and striking copy of the 1980s tourism cars history.
Premiere of an iconic decoration
In the summer of 1984, Tom Walkinshaw accepted the challenge of the Portuguese organization of the Grand Prix to travel later this year to Macau. With the European title in his pocket, the English driver and team boss was accompanied by one of his usual riders, German Hans Heyer. The guide race was a BMW fiefdom and the controversial English wanted to put an end to the Bavarian domain in the race. To this end, it had the precious support of JPS, which was relaunching the brand, decorating its cars with the famous black and gold colors that would later be eternalized in Ayrton Senna's Lotus. At the time, the guide race took place three weeks before 1000 km from Bathurst, another important race on the worldwide calendar of tourist racing, and so TWR made a "two in one."
The 100 -mile race on the streets of Macau would not have much history, such as the cars built in the Kidlington workshops against the competition headed by the two BMW 635i Schnitzer officers, guided by Hans Stuck and Dieter Quester, and painted by rival Marlboro. Tom Walkinshaw ended first and Hans Heyer and m second.
At the end of the race, quoted by the Portuguese newspaper Autosport, Tom Walkinshaw said: “The circuit is fantastic. Tight, but with many curves, climbs and descents, which made the race become difficult. But I like difficult things and, for me, the race was great from beginning to end.
The Jaguar were again invited by the Macao Grand Prix committee to run in 1985, but Tom Walkinshaw had other plans for his cars. Fortunately, thanks to Richard Meins we will continue to see this beautiful car on the tracks.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>TCR China | André Couto participated in the Zhejiang race</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/tcr-china-andre-couto-participou-na-prova-de-zhejiang/</link><description>No fim de semana transacto, André Couto teve um regresso inesperado ao campeonato TCR China, naquela que foi a sua primeira prova desta temporada. The rider of the sgas showed that "who knows, never forgets", despite having had a troubled passage through the Zhejiang International Circuit
The Portuguese pilot residing in Macao, who has not competed since November last year-when he played the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals, having won the title in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia Pro-AM category-received a last-minute invitation from MacPro Racing Team to conduct one of the Honda Civic Fl5 TCR Team in the third race of the Chinese Championship. TCR.
Without any previous workout, André Couto came back to sit in a car he already knew, also with a technical structure that was familiar to him. By 2023, the territory pilot had already played some TCR China events with this set, then at the service of the official team Dongfeng Honda Racing Team, showing a progress right from the beginning.
"Free training did not go wrong, but in qualification a less attentive pilot hit me on my first departure lap to the track. He hit me from behind and did not realize why. Damaged me the rear, dislocated the convergence and the car was crooked. Hm. "Still, I qualified myself in fourth in Q1, five tenths of the first, which, with the car in the conditions it was, was not bad. The car had potential."
In Q2, due to the damage, the Japanese car “became much harder to guide” and Couto ended in tenth. However, this ended up having a positive effect: “With the reversal of the starting grid, the tenth place of Q2 allowed me to start first to the second race.”
The first race, played on Saturday on the shaoxing track, did not go as well as the pilot wanted, not being able to follow the official links, nor the best Honda and Hyundai. "I ended up eighth. The car was not as good as expected and we found that there was a damaged damper, still from the crash in the qualification, which was exchanged for the Sunday race."
Inglorius Sunday
In the 20 Sunday round race, André Couto had everything to shine as he departed from pole-position and Honda finally seemed in a position to fight for the first places. "On the way back, the car was good. I didn't feel strange anymore and I was optimistic."
The idea was to get well to distance themselves from the fastest competitors in the first laps and then manage the race with new tires. However, it all faded quickly when it was wrapped by Wu Yi Fan right in the brake for the first curve.
“That was my mission, but I couldn't,” acknowledged the winner of the 2000 Macao Grand Prix. “He hit me on the first curve and the car was damaged. Sports commissioners, but that does not change the fact that I have given up. ”
With Honda's damaged direction, André Couto had no choice but to leave. "I was a bit disappointed because I hope to get a good result for MacPro Racing Team that had given me a good car.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:26:00</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA AFINA REGIONAL Formula Rules</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/gp-fia-afina-regras-da-formula-regional/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) took advantage of the holding of the Extraordinary General Assemblies and its annual conference to publish the Macao Grand Prix Regulation - FIA Regional Formula Cup of 2025. There are not many changes compared to 2024, but the changes introduced aim to browse gaps in the first edition of this macau.
The twelve red flags during last year's qualification session called for the level of pilots at the Guide Circuit, which was the premiere of the FIA ​​regional formula in Macau regional formula. This happened after the controversial decision of the FIA ​​to consider that Formula 3 was no longer adequate to the Macao Citadino layout.
Unsurprisingly, the sports regulation is now clear that, to compete in the FIA ​​regional formula world, “all pilots must have participated at least 3 competitions with a monolugar that has been projected and/or built to achieve a weight/power ratio of more than 3.0 kg/hp.”
Emanuele Pirro, a former F1 pilot, winner of the Guide Race and president of the FIA ​​monoligai committee, said during the weekend of the 71st edition that, in the future, the FIA ​​will be more demanding about track discipline. Thus, from now on, “any pilot who, in the opinion of sports commissioners, is solely responsible for the display of a red flag during the qualification training session, will not be able to continue to participate in this session and its best time back can be annulled.” The new regulation also states that “if a qualification training session is interrupted with less than four minutes remaining, it will not be restarted.”
On the other hand, the FIA ​​maintains the limit in the participation of more experienced pilots, except only “pilots who participated in a maximum of 3 FI F2 Championship competitions of 2025.” This measure goes a little against the spirit and history of the Great Prize, which has always gathered pilots from higher categories in its main race. In fact, this was a fervent question between Macao and the International Federation on two previous occasions.
In 1985, Alfredo César Torres, then responsible for Portuguese motorsport, convinced Jean-Marie Balestre, against his will, to allow the participation of F1 pilots in the F3 Intercontinental Cup in the name of the economic viability of the race. In 2016, the controversy returned with the veto da FIA to the participation of Nelsinho Piquet, a decision badly received by the teams and then coordinator Barry Bland, which would eventually abandon the co-organization of the race a year later.
Bet on continuity
In sports terms, registrations for this second edition of the FIA ​​regional formula Cup will remain open until July 30. The grill may include a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula monologues, all equipped with Alfa Romeo engines built by the Italian Autotechnic. Pirelli will once again be the official tire supplier.
The identities of the invited teams have not yet been revealed, but some news is expected in this field compared to 2024. To avoid any behind -the -scenes disputes, it has already been defined that “the position on the boxes for the teams that participate in the Macao Grand Prix will be based on the ranking of the previous year” and, in turn, “the position in the roadway for new teams will be attributed based on the order of application.”
Equal awards and more restricted advertising
The values ​​of monetary awards remain unchanged this year, with a total of US $ 68,500 to distribute, the equivalent of just over 550,000 patacas at the current exchange rate. The race winner will receive $ 12,000, an amount that is still far from covering the costs of participation in this nature.
On the other hand, the sports regulation introduces two new prohibitions on advertising into the monoligales. In addition to the existing prohibition of advertising to fortune or bad luck, tobacco or pornography, also the promotion of electronic cigarettes and alcoholic beverages - a measure that follows the legislation in force in the territory.
The 72nd Macao Grand Prix, the largest international sports event of the MSA, will take place between November 13 and 16, 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 03:31:16</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Project for new track in Zhuhai emerges</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/automobilismo-surge-projecto-para-nova-pista-em-zhuhai/</link><description>With a very black cloud to turn to the future of the Zhuhai International Circuit, there is a potential good news for the great bay of motoring: a project for a new permanent circuit in the Chinese city adjacent to the MSAR.
According to Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper, Guangdong's provincial government recently published the document “Measures to promote high quality tourism and accelerate the construction of a strong tourist province”, which proposes, for the first time, the creation of an “industrial circle of culture and tourism of the Great Bay”, offering political support to the integrated development of culture and tourism in the region. With this, the first industrial and tourist complex of motorized sports in the Great Bay may emerge.
The project of the Zhuhai Chaoyue international circuit was recently presented at the Zhuhai Ocean Spring Resort, located in Doumen, not far from the city's airport, with an initial investment of 250 million Renminbis.
According to the first information, the project of this circuit provides for welcoming evidence such as Formula 3 and foster collaborative development between motorized sports sectors, cultural events and exhibition industry. The plan includes the holding of several international tests per year and foresees collaboration with Hong Kong and Macau to connect cities such as Jiangmen and Zhongshan, promoting “Multiple stops” and boosting the innovative development of “Event Economics + Cultural Tourism”.
According to Zhou Jian, China Travel Service (Zhuhai) Executive Director General Ocean Spring Resort Co., the FIA ​​grade certification-will also include a karting track, drift track and an interior space of 2,400 m² for exhibitions and events related to the automobile sector. With more than 50 international events projected annually, the goal is to become a "super IP" that joins running, leisure and tourism under the same concept.
The first phase of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit project will include international certification professionals, as well as support facilities. This project aims not only to fill “a gap in the high -end motorized sports sector in Zhuhai, but will also promote the modernization of the Great Bay's cultural, sports and tourist industries by conducting international racing and themed cultural events linked to motorsport.”
Uncertainties in the air
Last summer, the company Malay LBS Bina Group BHD announced that it sold its participation in the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) - the first permanent circuit built in the interior of China - by 124.7 million ringits (about 214.15 million patacas). In a statement to Bursa Malaysia Securities BHD, the group reported that their subsidiary, Dragon Hill Corporation Ltd, sold all his participation in Lamdeal Investments Ltd (Lil) to Huafa Urban Operation (HK) Ltd, a well -known real estate operator. Lil Detinha 60 percent of Zhuhai International Circuit Limited (ZICL), circuit operator.
Raised in 1996 in order to receive the first major award from China from Formula 1 - something that never materialized - ZIC was still the initial motor of motoring in the country and a reference in Asian motorsport. Since its opening, it has welcomed several international evidence, such as the FIA ​​GT, A1 GP or the Intercontinental Le Mans Series. In recent years, track administration has chosen to organize its own events, abdicating the most costly international evidence.
Despite having received, in the past, auto competitions from MSAR, ZIC has been losing protagonism in local motorized sport, due to high prices, limited availability and reducing sports activity in favor of the most profitable commercial activities. The future of the circuit remains uncertain: it is only known that lease agreements between resident teams and the circuit have been frozen and are not being renewed. The track approval will also be about to expire, requiring a new certification to continue to receive competitions in the future.
However, on the weekend of June 14 and 15, the still only circuit of Zhuhai will host the third race of the Formula 4 China Championship season.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 01:53:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao's historicals get a GP clearance</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/historicos-de-macau-conseguem-apuramento-para-gp/</link><description>The Guangdong International Circuit welcomed, last weekend, the second and decisive double journey of Macao - Macau Road Sport Challenge cars, proof of finding for the most important motor racing of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. In a journey with few celebration reasons for the colors of the sinters, the veterans Jerónimo Badaraco and Rui Valente managed to ensure the qualification.
With a list of 68 subscribers, the grill was divided into two groups, A and B, with all the pilots competing with Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8) models. This year, with only one race scheduled for the Grand Prix Program - due to the inclusion of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup - the number of riders was reduced to 36, which placed a supplementary pressure for both missing races. To complicate, the rain has arrived, changing the turns to teams and riders.
In Group A, where Rui Valente faced a complicated weekend on the track around Zhaoqing, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão failed to qualify, in a series dominated by Hong Kong pilots. In Saturday's race, the podium consisted of Wong Chuck Pan, Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping. On Sunday, these three repeated the feat, but with a new order: Lo Pak Yu, Chan Ka Ping and Wong Chuck Pan.
In difficult atmospheric conditions on Saturday, Rui Valente ended only 25th, due to an error in tuning, improving to 15th on Sunday, with the track dry. A penalty after the second race fired him to the 27th place. Still, the 7th place obtained on the first round was enough to secure a place in the Macao Grand Prix.
On the contrary, Maximiano Mannão, behind the wheel of a Toyota with the colors of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended on 26th and 14th, a result below the finding, but it turns out to be positive given that it was Jove Pilot's debut in these wanderings. Célio Alves Dias, with difficulties in his car since the first race, was 24th and 28th, far from the usual level of this experienced Macaense pilot.
Badaraco with final sprint '
On a weekend, where the lively races were broadcast on live streaming in Group B, Hong Kong riders stood out again. On Sunday, Adrian Chung won, with Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin completing the podium. In the second confrontation, Cheang Kin Sang reached a deserved victory, followed again by Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin.
Jerónimo Badaraco came to this challenging weekend without the assured clearance. A modest qualification and 11th Saturday place maintained the open outcome. However, a solid race on Sunday and an excellent 4th place assured veteran Macanese the much desired place on the grid of the Macao Grand Prix, along with countrymen Cheng Kin San, Leong Keng Hei, Lou Check In and Carson Tang.
Also outside the big prize was Dionísio Albino Pereira, who finished 23rd in Saturday's race, but closed the time more forcefully, by cutting the line of goal in 13th place in the second race.
At the end of the races, competitors provisionally calculated had an extra technical verification, being forced to open engines and gearbox, to verify the legality of these two decisive organs of their vehicles.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:57:43</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
