Macau Urban Renewal has announced that the six apartment blocks have already been licensed for use and that the next step will be to deliver the fractions to buyers
 
Almost 10 years later, part of the solution to one of the most intense real estate -related controversies in Macao is in sight, which involved cases in court, demonstrations and even applications to the Legislative Assembly. Pearl Horizon's injured buyers are about to occupy fractions in buildings built on the same terrain, this time under the aegis of Macau Urban Renewal (MRU).
The public capital company announced that the housing project for exchange in the P Lot P of the new landfills, called Pearl Metropolitan, completed the inspection and licensing phase for use. According to MRU, the next step will be to advance with the delivery procedures of houses to buyers.
The “Pearl Metropolitan is composed of six 50 -story apartment blocks, providing 2,064 autonomous fractions. At the end of March, the MRU indicated that from a total of 1,923 calls qualified to buy apartments in the complex, 1,880 had already chosen apartments.
The company highlights the “superior geographical location” of the housing complex which, besides being next to the river, is close to access to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, the Macao Bridge, the Qingmao borders and siege doors, as well as the Macao airport and the outdoor passenger maritime terminal.
All included
Each apartment block is equipped with four elevators. The parking lot has 1,873 seats for cars and 490 seats for motorcycles, equipped with electric vehicle recharge points. In addition, “Pearl Metropolitan” has Clubhouse, pool, gym and outdoor park, along an area with over 16,000 square meters. The recreation zone also has a playground and running route about 700 meters.
The apartments are from the T1, T2 and T3 typology, with areas between 57 and 135 square meters, all have balconies and have all cooking and bathroom equipment.

Franky Fong suggests the elimination of notarial rates and taxes on real estate transactions
 
The president of the Macao Real Estate Real Estate Agents Association (official name), Franky Fong, is not satisfied with how the government has dealt with the sector crisis. Speaking to the newspaper or Mun, the representative lamented that, despite the "excellent results" of the game industry and the increase in the volume of tourists, "the government has ignored the real estate sector, which is in a dying state, as well as the owners affected by the devaluation of real estate, which made them poorest."
From the perspective of the leader and businessman in the field, the government could take several measures to reverse the situation. To begin with, the SAM Hou Fai Executive could change the law that regulates the real estate mediation activity, updating or eliminating excessive penalties and costly regulations. Franky Fong argues that the law should have a penalty mechanism that applies fines and other penalties according to the severity of the offenses, so that agents have more opportunities to correct light failures.
Make way
Another way to stimulate the real estate sector, may undergo tax reduction, such as seal on the transmission of property and building contribution, and the weight of expenses, such as notarial charges, associated with the purchase and sale of real estate.
Franky Fong does not agree that notarial charges are calculated according to the value of the property transaction, instead of having a fixed fee, as it turns out in Hong Kong where notarial and registration costs can range from a few hundred Hong Kong dollars, he said.
Regarding fiscal policy, the official argues that only fractions inhabited under the lease agreement are subject to the collection of a building contribution.
On the other hand, the associative leader advocates the facilitation of bank loans for home purchase, namely by reducing the entrance ratio, or through credit plans with bonuses.
Currently, the maximum mortgage loan ratio is 70 percent and the amount of 30 percent of the house price. Franky Fong points out that both in Hong Kong and the interior of China, flexibility measures have been applied that allow the acquisition of housing without such a high capital entrance.
For the associative leader, the return of the Macao residence fixation policy by investment would be another measure of capacity to inject new energy and capital in the market and the local economy.</description><pubDate>2025-07-10 00:09:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Foundation | André Ritchie at the Curators Council</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/10/fundacao-macau-andre-ritchie-no-conselho-de-curadores/</link><description>The chief executive will keep Wu Zhiliang as president of the Macau Foundation, a position he has been in.

China will issue national obligations in Macao, worth 6 billion Yuan, to “support the development of the obligation of the obligation” of the MSAR, was announced yesterday.
"The Ministry of Finance of the Government of the Popular Republic of China and the Government of the Special Administrative Region of Macao today announced [yesterday] that the central government will issue national obligations in Macao, worth six billion RMB [Renminbis]," can be read in a statement of the media. The issue, intended for institutional investors, will be made on July 16, adds the office.
"Continuous issuance of national obligations in Macao demonstrates the importance and support of the central government regarding the cultivation of the new areas of financial activities in Macau, such as the obligationary market, and the promotion of diversified development of the economy of Macao," says the government of Raem, which greeted the decision of finances in Beijing.
The emission “will help attract international investors to participate in the Macao's obligationary market, promote the development of the Offshore market from RMB in Macao and will deepen the financial cooperation between the interior of China and Macau,” he was added.
Repeated Acts
In October, China had already issued Macao debt securities worth 5 billion Yuan. The Macao government has mentioned the possible creation of a 'offshore' stock market, called Renminbi, linked to the role that the region has taken as a platform for commercial and financial services between China and Portuguese -speaking countries.
In January, Macau's financial regulator said the central banks of Angola and Timor -Leste are interested in issuing public debt on the MSAR to attract investors from mainland China.
Henrietta Lau Hang Kun, a member of the Board of the Monetary Authority of Macao, said the institution has been trying to promote the territory as "a financial service platform with Lusophone countries."
"For now, we are still negotiating with Lusophone countries" so that the debt issuance "passes here, through Macao, to the [China] market," added Henrietta Lau. In May 2019, Portugal became the first country in the eurozone to issue debt in Chinese currency, worth 2 billion Renminbis.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 23:59:37</pubDate></item><item><title>AL | New Regiment prohibits deputies from disseminating content of the commissions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/al-novo-regimento-proibe-deputados-de-divulgar-conteudos-das-comissoes/</link><description>With the new Hemiciclo Regiment approved yesterday, the deputies are prohibited from publicizing the subjects discussed in the meetings of the permanent committees, except for their presidents and secretaries. The subject generated debate yesterday in the Assembly regarding the limits of what may or may not be said. Pereira Coutinho voted against this article
 
The deputies of the Legislative Assembly (AL) are now prohibited from disseminating what is discussed at the Hemiciclo Commission meetings, "anyway," with the exception of its president and secretary. These usually disclose the content of the meetings at a press conference after their holding, and this will keep up.
This new regulation arises after the vote and discussion, in general and specialty, the alteration to the al. It was one of the most discussed topics in yesterday's debate, with the deputies arguing on what may or can not be said, having José Pereira Coutinho voted against this concrete article.
The disclosure of information from the meetings, which serves to analyze in the specialty proposals of law and always steering at the closed door, was something that was not yet regulated.
Coutinho began by asking if he could disclose the information "during the plenary meeting", for example, having said that "he never heard of any deputy who had violated that duty." "There have been meetings in the past where the secretaries warned about the information that should not be disclosed and nothing has been said. We are only 33 deputies and we should think of the possibility of revealing what was discussed, because it is difficult to define borders about what can or can not be revealed and this will give rise to many discussions later," he said.
The legislator also pointed out that "it can be difficult to execute this norm" and that "the principle of transparency" should be followed.
Ho Ion Sang, who presided over to the commission that analyzed the new Al Regiment, explained that "the content of the meetings is subject to the duty of confidentiality and this matter was clarified." "The content can be said by the president of the commissions after the meetings, at the press conferences, and journalists can ask questions. In practice remains as always happened and that has given good results," he said.
Meet the meetings
Another point addressed, whether or not the permanent committees were held at the closed door, and Pereira Coutinho defended the opening to the public like what happens in Hong Kong. The AL regiment does not prohibit open meetings, but this always depends on a prior deliberation.
But Iau Teng Pio, deputy, advised against the opening of the meetings. "The purpose of the closed -door meetings is so that members of the government, advisors and deputies can argue at ease even if there is no final decision.
Kou Hoi In, president of AL, recalled that “the spirit of the norm has not been changed” and that everything will remain in it, only the ban on what deputies cannot refer outside the commissions.
"The reserved character of permanent commissions is so that everyone can speak freely and if any deputy says this or that can spoil sensations of injustice in society to deputies and this cannot happen. We have to protect deputies and ensure confidentiality."
At yesterday's meeting, there was also the discussion of the duty of the deputy to participate in all permanent committees, even in those to which he does not belong. Several deputies spoke of the need for better coordination of meetings agendas.
"In the future there may be more practical coordination because there are many meetings and law proposals. We can schedule the meetings for more deputies," he said.
Moreover, the new Al regiment prohibits deputies by "clothing or signs, banners, signs or other objects that have offensive content or political provocation, or undermine the dignity of the AL".</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 23:47:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Taiwan | Beijing applies export controls to military companies</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/10/taiwan-pequim-aplica-controlos-de-exportacao-a-empresas-militares/</link><description>China yesterday imposed export controls on eight Taiwan defense companies, as it aims, according to Beijing, to protect national security, the day they start the largest military maneuvers on the island.

The new number has six visual projects, two of them black and white, which open and close the magazine.
Jane Xu's first, who is entitled “Black Enlivened by Colors”, offers a portrait of female intimacy, in line with the artist's visual practice and his thematic research.
In a different way, but still black and white, João Palla concludes in this number of the magazine the second part of his project “White Gold Whispers”. “The poetic expression of its visual proposal articulates perfectly with the aesthetic effect obtained with the contrast between black and white,” says the event organization
The four other visual projects, in color, test different approaches to chromatic and thematic composition. Jorge Veiga Alves presents “Memories of Macau”, seeking to reinforce the memory effect in the approach to the contemplation of traditional spaces, namely religious in nature.
Field and city
José Luís de Sales Marques' second color project is dedicated to the famous procession of Senhor dos Passos, which takes place in Macao, underlining the role of this event, not only in the social and cultural context of the city, but also in its integration into the public space of Macau.
In the third project, António Duarte Mil-Homens presents us a contemplative time in “Sunset, Moonrise”, addressing the nature and essence of the Alentejo landscape. The succession of color marks the hours and differentiates impressions, which conform the immensity of the Alentejo plain and its morphology.
In the fourth project, color also plays a key role in its expressiveness and visual conformation: Tang Kuok Hou's “photosynthesis” proposes a social and aesthetic exploitation of the city of Macao, reinforcing its role as a place of photographic study par excellence, which has justified a multitude of various approaches, both thematic and sociological or formal, given its expressive richness.</description><pubDate>2025-07-10 00:35:04</pubDate></item><item><title>EU | China rejects interference in the relationship with Russia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/10/ue-china-rejeita-interferencias-na-relacao-com-a-russia/</link><description>The Chinese government yesterday rejected interference with its relations with Russia, after the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, appealed to Beijing to end his “unshakable support” to Moscow in the war against Ukraine.
"Normal cooperation between China and Russia does not admit interference from third parties," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said at a press conference. Mao assured that the ties between Beijing and Moscow "are not directed against any third part."
The statements arise in response to criticism from von der Leyen, who said the day before, during a debate in the European parliament, that "the unshakable support of China to Russia is creating great instability and insecurity for Europe."
"We can say that, in practice, China is allowing Russia's war economy - and this is not acceptable," said the leader of the community executive, stressing that the way Beijing continues to interact with the Vladimir Putin war will be determining for the future of relations between the European Union (EU) and China.
Von der Leyen is expected to visit Beijing in late July, accompanied by European Council Chairman António Costa for a summit who will mark the 50 years of diplomatic relations between the two parties.</description><pubDate>2025-07-10 00:38:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Zape | Defended night tourism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/10/zape-defendido-turismo-nocturno/</link><description>Member of the Central Zone Community Services Advisory Board, Chan Hio Teng, argued that Zape should be transformed into a night tourism attraction.

A demanding discipline, recognized until centuries later by distinguished theoreticals such as Dong Qichang (1555-1635), which put the barrier from which this painting could be exercised very high: no less than in Wang Wei (701-61) mode, the recognized founder of literate painting: 'Only after someone is like Wang Wei can use the Wang Qia Pomo way'.
Examples from the brush of this creator are today hardly observable and the termination of it preserved, there is almost only the seductive echo of a name that refers the listener to the expression of the substance of the Spirit. However, there is another name that in the stories of painting is often associated with him, that of Gu Kuang (727-821), of whom the paintings today are also rare but from whom they have been stored poems that indicate an imponderable presence.
In a palace poem, it is noted the availability to feel the abundant but subtle torrent of beauty captured by the senses, like the one in the wind or in a sound: «In a tower of jade, halfway to the sky, a song blown to the flute begins,/ The wind delivers in the palace the harmonious sound of the Palreo and the laughter of the girls who dwell. Drinking in the clepsidra,/ the waters, redrillants as crystals, would say a curtain unfolded over the Rio do Autumn. » But the poet and painter, disillusioned with the intrigues that embarrassed his duties at the service of the palace, removes the public service and will use the name well daoist buweng, the "old reclusive".
Gu Kuang had obtained the Jinshi degree, which allowed him to be an imperial employee in 757, in the unstable time of Emperor Tang Suzong, whose reign (756-62) would be marked by the concern to calm the revolt of An Lushan who had spread like a forest fire. Revolt that had forced his father to abdicate, Emperor Xuanzong and the consequent condemnation of the death of his favorite concubine, a fact reported in Ba Juyi's plangent poem (722-846), corner of perpetual remorse.
Born in Yunyang (current Danyang, Jiangsu) after a life saddened by the death of a son, he moves with his family in 792 to the mountainous chain of Maoshan, south of Jurong, where he will receive the grace of a new son at the age of seventy. When he goes there, he writes a purpose: «Hidden in Maoshan; To make basic gold metals,/ to make the body light as a pity.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves - Assistant researcher and coordinator of the Educational Service of the Macao Scientific and Culture Center
They have been running ink rivers on the founding of Macao, as well as the foundation of Lisbon. The latter the academics consider it more prudent, after properly analyzed the etymologies, to be due to Phoenicians or Tartassi (Rocha, 2007), but that the legend is poetically reminiscent of Ulysses, from Luís Vaz Camões to Fernando Pessoa.  Thus it reads at the beginning of the eighth corner of Os Lusíadas, which the beginnings of Portugal find their mythical roots in Luso, son and companion of Bacchus, and those of Lisbon in Ulysses (Camões, 1997, VIII.5):
Ulisses is the one who makes the Santa Casa
To the goddess who gives her Facunda language;
That if there in Asia Trojan insigne abrasa,
Here in Europe Lisbon Imparty Funda.
Nothing more about the illustrious Lusitanians descended from gods, as well as their geographical spaces were founded by Greek heroes of unparalleled value such as Ulysses, whose ingenuity warrior and marear art exceeded. Hence, some centuries became Fernando Pessoa, in the second epic poem that the Portuguese value the most, the message refer to Ulysses pointing to their mythological dimension and the unavoidable reality it sustains, since “myth is nothing that is everything” (Pessoa, 1986, 24):
 Thus the legend
To come into reality
And fertilizing it takes place.
Below, life, half
Nothing, dies.
Myths and legends offer reality often the best it has, in its quality of projection reveal ideas and ideals, providing an important source where the unconscious manifests itself, but also the collective conscious of a people. Ulysses Warrior and Navigator is the patriarch found to the measure to found the capital of a country of indomitable warriors who faced powerful empires, such as Muslim, the Roman, and later the Spanish and who had to discover the sea path to India, beyond the Extrema Asia, without ever losing its Cavalheresque facet.
This would be masterfully praised in the corner VI of Os Lusíadas in the episode of the twelve of England, among which figured Magriço. They would know how to defend the honor of their ladies to the sword, revealing a huge bravery, narrated by Veloso (Camões, 1997, VI. 48):
This one, who helps him I didn't want to
 For not causing intestinal discord,
 Tells you: when the law intended
 From the kingdom there from the Iberian lands,
 In Lusitanians I saw so much boldness,
 Both prime and such divine parts,
 That they alone could, if not error,
 Support your part to fire and iron.
This chivalry had to be a constant in the Portuguese imagination, not just with ladies, but with all those who saw each other in trouble. This happened in England, so it would succeed in southern China, when the Portuguese helped the Chinese to clean the pirate seas and in reward were allowed a quiet existence in Macao.
In fact, even if only a myth or a legend, it would only have its reason for being, because it reveals a certain collective image that the Portuguese have of themselves and that greatly contributes, in terms of existential value, to guide the conduct of the population: they are where they are accurate, in helping the most unprotected, in one hand the heart, the heart. This is an image that once mitigated, it may be that "nothing that is everything."
Regarding the founding of Macao, the scholar, faces an interesting mix between myth and reality: first comes reality, then the legend comes, and the latter will have infinitely more weight, but be aware of the following information of unsuspected thinkers and historians.
Luís Gonzaga Gomes, in Macao - A Municipality with History (1997) in the chapter “Divergent Theses on the Origin of Macao”, argues that there are several theses about the foundation of Macao as a Chinese space ruled by Portuguese from 1557, and this date does not exclude that the Portuguese had already walked through those stops since 1555, the height of Fernão Mendes Pinto, where the first time appears of the name of the name Macao related to the Portuguese.
As for theses there are three most credible:
“1) Macao was donated to the Portuguese; 2) This donation was made in rewarding the services provided by Portuguese in the destruction of pirates; and 3) the occurrence took place in 1577” (GOMES, 1997, 26) later, after presenting several points of view, linked to remarkable liters, including Álvaro Semedo, as Chinese, argues that “Macau outside the Portuguese reason Exposed, what is to reward the valuable feat of the destruction of piracy in the seas of southern China ”(GOMES, 1997, 37). In this sense, it is mentioned by several authors, and as a misrepresented as expectable, the name of the fearsome chief of the pirates, which will have valid the famous imperial edict or plate, is called Tchang Si Lao, or Sam Chislao, or Charempum, Litauquiem, or Similao (Gomes, 1997, 37).
This finding does not exclude other more commercial readings from obtaining this platform, which was also commercial in China, and a price for the payment of the ground forum in Da Ming Shi (大明史 History of the Ming Dynasty) quoted by A.J. H. Chargignon, of 20,000 rights in Macau. (GOMES, 1997, 34).
The coexistence of both chronology versions of the history of Macao will be found. XVI-XVII centuries organized by historian Beatriz Basto da Silva (1992), who reassembles an important episode of annihilation of a certain and dangerous pirate Lam Chin at 1547, in a description of Chinese employee Lam Hei-Yuen, who shot the following way “and so the pirates who had acted comfortable for 20 years were won in one day. contrary they protect us against them, they did not do any harm to our people, but they even did the Chinese well ”(Yuen apud Silva, 1992, 33), being presented in the same chronology the year 1554 as the first verbal agreement by Leonel Sousa, which legalizes the situation of payment of commercial rights and“ Portuguese are allowed to be freely trade in the area that would become Macao ”. (SILVA, 1992, 39), dating from 1557 in this chronology the establishment of the first Portuguese in Macao, a date that agrees with the advanced by Luís Gonzaga Gomes, as well as in the suicide of the Chan-Si-Lau pirate and the defeat of the pirates of Rio das Pearls, as well as Leonel Sousa “obtain authorization to establish the previous settlement of the Portuguese in Macau (…) from Macau. ” (SILVA, 1992, 43).
In fact, there is the coexistence of the two most likely origins for the founding of Macau in the chronology of Beatriz Basto da Silva. It was asked: It would have been the verbal agreement and the subsequent settlement, with the payment of the floor of the ground, possible if the effective help of the Portuguese gentlemen and warriors had not been verified to the Chinese authorities, through concrete help to local traders who were constantly pressured by coans who then abounded in the seas of China and southern China?
The cleaning of maritime ground, provided by developed technology, at the best in the world, greatly contributed to helping if it had made it concrete and real, slowly deserving of a western people of the far east of Asia and only because it was really useful in combating pirates could make a legend, since from the beginning either readings was valid but partial. In order to obtain a correct and impartial reading of what has happened, it is believed that it is necessary to combine them, understanding how decisive it was in the good relationship of the two peoples to combat pirates, without them, there would not have been Macao, flushed by foreigners in Chinese territory.

After buying the map, we realize the green spots that this city is filled with gardens. From Tricycle we arrived at a two -star hotel, despite the offering of the four -star accommodation, with discounts, just for some more exchanges allow us to enjoy superior quality of comfort. With the bags already in the room, it is at the reception that we learn about the existence in the city of a brush museum.
Considered the capital of brushes, because according to a saying, the huzhou brushes, the role of Xuan de Xuanzhou rice (Anhui), the paint from China de Huizhou (also in Anhui) and the Duan Stone for the Zhaoqing (Guangdong) paint, are the four treasures of Chinese painting.
Right on the trip to the hotel I could see it is the small town because, from the bus terminal, in ten minutes we are in the center, traveling half the main avenue that longitudinally divides it. Now walking, we will have a channel with terrace on the banks. It looks like a good place to in the shadow, quietly refreshing from the noon. We are in the Hebin Garden. Still sitting and then wave us with a glass and a bottle. After an affirmative gesture, they bring a glass full of green tea leaves and hot water in a thermal container, which on the table is to serve.
Soon appearances appear that for a Reminbi they remove the dust in their shoes, giving them a small polydela. Glasses quickly tormented rest and an EHRU player experiences, with amplifier sounds, captivating us to enjoy a few songs. But his little introduction to the song of “Yue Liang Wo Di Chin” (the moon represents my heart) proves to be more annoying than cultural.
Studying a busy but narrow pedestrian street where, despite the surrounding buildings, they are unmistakable from the environment, a recent dragon door gives access to the part of the city where a long time is perpetuated. Another longmen, this old and made of wood, gives the smoke temple, which will be from the same period and where the floor is arranged. Abroad, a number of antique sellers spread the articles on the floor.
We went through clothing stores and between two of these stores, a cubicle with a counter where some people expect that from the coal grill on the ember to be ready for the skewers of different pieces of meat stuck in a long toothpick. We snack on Carneiro to deceive the stomach because they start to be hours of dinner. We are walking attentive to the restaurants, which in the distance are distinguished, as marked by red round lanterns.
Avenida dos Hotels
It is on Hongqi Lu Street, where most hotels are found, which due to the appearance we chose the restaurant, after going through many fast food, both Chinese and the two main foreign brands. At the entrance, a part of sales abroad with a lot of demand, we refer to being in a good place. Thoughts disguise the waiting time, when they tell us to be the pre-payment restaurant and there is no list to choose the dishes. Meats already cooked are mostly barbecue and are exposed in the sales sector, behind glass.
Five in the afternoon and already with the passwords bought for the meal, chosen by the dishes of the tables of customers there for dinner. We are served to tofu soaked in soy sauce and a halted hazeln ease with meat stuffing, floating in a soup. Cheap food to serve as dinner after the job.
Smoken in flavor, we are interrupted by a corcovered beggar of a certain age that seems to ask for money. Offering what we are eating, so all the food is emptied for the bowl and not even the sauce. Faced with such hunger, found later when we saw her in the stairs to eat, we still offer you money to another meal.
Mendicity is a recent phenomenon in China, although there have always been two types of people who walk through the streets and seem beggars. Those who vague live their fate, indifferent and whose people offer them food and those who in poorer places migrate to cities. Of course there are already beggars as well.
The sound of music comes out of stores and the foreign fast food restaurant uses a powerful column where a young maid dances to the sound of children for children, waiting for them to accompany her.
We tried to prove the specialties of the land and therefore, at the Huzhou Hotel restaurant, of two stars, tasted referenced dishes as local kitchen. We were served a fish flower, fish dish that, after baking in a bittersweet sauce, is twisted with his skin to serve as a flower-shaped chalice and thus presented. But it is at the four -star Hotel Zhebei that an exquisite kitchen gives us a tofu we miss.
The price is cheaper than the previous one. This restaurant had been recommended by two young women, who were waiting for their friends and whom a maid asks for help communicating with us, when we one day we climbed to the second floor of a cooked food restaurant at the table, the vulgar Hot-Pot. Realizing that they only serve vegetables, meat or seafood, to be cooked in the heated pan over a gas nozzle in the center of the table, we get up and prepare to leave.
Requestly ask us in English the reason we leave. Then comes the two young college students in Hangzhou, who lived at the family home. Explaining this is not the food that feels like us, we took the opportunity to ask for other regional food restaurants. Since apologizing to Huzhou for not having many restaurants, they present the best and cheap price the restaurant of the Zhebei Hotel.
After a harrowing and as it is early, as in China starts dinner at five in the afternoon, we returned to the avenue and then the hotel from where we saw another, also four stars, the International Huzhou. Continuing on the same ride, we found the Tian Yun silk store. Then a brush store, where there is for all sizes and prices, reaching porcelain or bamboo cable brushes, costing thousands of yuans.
Brushes Museum
Diving into Huzhou's past, entering one of the city's most picturesque streets. A Christian church dominates the street and around, stores occupy the part under the two -story houses. By the solidoes in the heads of some people, we realize that some of the business belong to Muslims. After refusing to be photographed, a tangerine salesman offers us a delicious fruit piece. Continuing, curiosity leads us to meet the stone bridge with three arches built in 1539, with some embedded ornamental stones.
Hence and to southwest, we go to the garden of the painter and calciple Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) Painter Museum. This was native of Wuxing (today Huzhou), named after courtesy and pseudonyms Songxue, Oubo and Shuijinggong Daoren. He was a descendant prince of the Song Dynasty, but he served the Mongols Yuan Dynasty as an official at the Hanlin Academy.
As a painter, he specializes in the representation of horses and used recreating themes and styles of the old masters, with simple colors to make the landscapes. In addition to being a master of Tang Dynasty techniques, he was an excellent Caligraph, considered one of the main four in the history of Chinese calligraphy.
Already in the garden, the serenity with which the green of the vegetation is combined in the lake with the brown of the rest pavilions, or in the woods of the tea houses, it takes us there a long time, recreating figures with the reflection in the waters of the ornamental stones. We have to leave the garden to visit the Brushes Museum which, despite being encompassed in the same room, has an autonomous entrance. Huzhou brushes are referenced as the best in the country and so you have to see how they are made.
In chronological terms, the brush was invented in the late 3rd century A.N.E. By Meng Tian, ​​a military commander of the Qin Dynasty. However, it is perceived by the painted vessels of different neolithic cultures, which must have existed for at least five thousand years. Therefore, Meng Tian will be linked, not to the invention, but to the improvement of brushes. Also the city of Huzhou is not the real place of production of the best brushes, but has won this title since in ancient times Shanlian, in the municipality of Wuxing, province of Zhejiang, was over his jurisdiction. The handwriting brushes made had their heyday during the Yuan Dynasty and are still considered among the best in all of China.
Four steps are required to manufacture the HU brush, and the coat of the rabbit, the fingernail and the goat hair is used. After the fat is removed with tire juice, the hair is cut into equal sizes and enter a solution to clean them. They are then united at the base with arabic gum and after drying, united with a tile that unites them to the bamboo.
With the brush made in its structure, the other phase of the process is passed. The hair is bumped to a porridge made of algae to put them together and with the wire wrapped a tip is created, the most important part of the brush. This wire that goes through the hair, on a lap gives the cone shape and also serves to remove the excess of the agglutinator papa.
With extreme patience and skill, the brushes are clean, rounded, creating a tip, with good elasticity. Then the brush, ready, passes to the hands of another employee, where in the bamboo cable are recorded the characters Tian Kuan Trade Mark, which replaced the old “double goat” brand.
The goat hair (HAO) brushes (HAO) are soft and serve to write small characters, rabbit hair are hard and those of the fingernail are between the two, with great elasticity for the handwriting of large characters. Sometimes a mixture of different hair is made, using those of other animals.
There are brushes of all kinds of sizes, serving some to paint and others to call. The best for Chinese handwriting are the rabbit and goat hair mix. HU brushes were widely used in the imperial court.
In the other part of the museum is the painter's room Zhao Mengfu with its utensils and some works, where the recorded stones are not lacking. Although the museum has a sales section, after leaving the museum and already on the street, a set of stores is dedicated to the sale of products for Chinese painting.
Leaving the brushes, we visited the market and crossing a wooden bridge in Zig-Zag, we traveled another old part of the city. Clothing extenders hide salespeople with bags full of tea leaves finished spoon that belong to the first harvest of the year, the best.
Our stay in Huzhou also serves to visit places at an hour of bus, such as Anji, to see the Bamboo Museum and already outside Zhejiang province in Jiangsu, Dingshan, referenced as the place of production of the best tea services. The southern bank of Taihu is the border line between the Huzhou district in Zhejiang province and Jiangsu province, where Lake Tai expands.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Today Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/hoje-macau/</link><description>China yesterday imposed export controls on eight Taiwan defense companies, as it aims, according to Beijing, to protect national security, the day they start the largest military maneuvers on the island.

The NGO released a report yesterday with the title “Networks that hold. Sexual exploitation of childhood and adolescence in digital environments”, which elaborated with the European Association for Digital Transition and which includes official data and an inquiry to over 1,000 young people aged 18 to 21.
According to the study, 97 percent of these young people said they were victims of some kind of sexual violence on the Internet during adolescence, including contacts from adults for sexual purposes, unauthorized diffusion of intimate images or blackmail and threats to send intimate and sexual content.
Another type of violence enhanced in the report is the use of artificial intelligence tools to create sexual content from a real image of adolescents or children (content known as 'Deepfake' or 'Ultra counterfeits').
According to the study, one in five young Spaniards was the victim of the creation and diffusion of these 'Deepfake' during adolescence, namely with sharing by another person, to third parties, and without consent, of their own nudity images, elaborated through artificial intelligence.
"The Internet, social networks and technologies not only facilitate capture and exposure to sexual exploitation -related risks, but can be the means by which these violence against boys and girls are committed and allow their perpetuation," said Save the Children, in a statement released from the study published yesterday.
Starter
Social networks are the most frequent way for aggressors to start contacts with the teenage victims, with the study also highlighting online video games in the case of boys. After this first contact, they move to applications and messages of messages such as WhatsApp, Telegram or Discord.
Girls are the ones that most denounce to be pressured to send intimate content (28.5 percent of 18.4 percent of boys), with the study that all victims had shared personal or intimate information on the Internet during childhood and adolescence.
According to the study, only 50 percent of young people when they were smaller considered contact with unknown people one of the main risks of the internet and only 32.9 percent mentioned as dangerous the consented send of intimate images to adults.
On the other hand, 70 percent states that it has not seen as a risk, in adolescence, the manipulation of photographs and videos with artificial intelligence. Asked the reasons why they sent intimate or sexual images of themselves, 48 ​​percent says it did not know it was something potentially dangerous, 46 percent weighed that it was normal and 42 percent sought attention, affection or some kind of validation.
Alone at home
In this context, Save the Children warns, in the study, for the lack of follow -up of minors; The scarce digital formation, in cybersecurity, privacy and recognition of danger situations and the intensive use of technologies by children and adolescents.
According to data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Spain, cited in the NGO report, in 2023 there were 4,896 complaints for offenses on the Internet against children and adolescents, 1,068 of which were sexual crimes.
"These numbers represent only the tip of the iceberg, as most cases do not know, in part, for the absence of denunciation and, in part, for the difficulties in detection, which increases when these facts take place in an online environment," said Save The Children Catalina Perazzo, cited in the NGO statement.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 01:11:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Works | Revitalization of the pier 23-25 ​​and Patio of eternal happiness later this year</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/obras-revitalizacao-dos-cais-23-25-e-patio-da-eterna-felicidade-ainda-este-ano/</link><description>There are six historical areas to revitalize with the support and investment of the six game operators, but the deputies question the absence of news about what is being done and the slowness of the projects. The government assured that between the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth will be released more data and completed revitalizations of old zones
 
The revitalization of the 23-25 ​​quay in the interior port area and the eternal happiness courtyard should be completed later this year, being interconnected with the projects designed and funded between the executive and the six game operators for six ancient Macao zones.
The warranty was given yesterday by the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP. "The revitalization of the six zones is a priority task for the government, because we have to rely on the investments of the dealers. We have done studies, made an arrangement of the resources and now we know what we have. We want, at the end of the third quarter, beginning of the four quarter, to be able to advance with more details."
More concretely, it was up to a representative of the Cultural Institute to confirm that the rehabilitation of the eternal happiness courtyard and pier 23-25 ​​is completed at the same time.
Tai Kin IP has ensured that the government “is not stopped” while analyzing and studies. “We have already given instructions [to dealers] for the work that can be adjusted. We ask dealers to do the analysis depending on the characteristics of the zones. We will complete the structures [this year], with remodeling and restoration works, and we are working.”
The secretary stressed that the type of consumption is also being analyzed in these six zones, according to the type of tourists, with "two categories of consumption, the traditional and new generations."
“I ask you to accelerate”
Despite the promises of more detail, the deputies mourned the lack of more detailed information. “The essentials is to publicize the projects, because the government has to conduct certain investments and guide the market. Can the government have time to do the studies, but will small and medium -sized businesses take this time on studies? Will stores that are in the six zones continue to explore the activity?” Asked Deputy Ron Lam.
According to the deputy, the ideas for the six zones should result in a “transparent and publicized project to the public”, because “the whole society [has to be heard] so that all projects can reflect the market panorama”.
Another critical voice was that of IP Sio Kai, who asked for a comprehensive revitalization. “Everyone expects changes in the community economy. Concessionaires are committed to the six zones, but have passed two and a half years [since the announcement of the projects]. Of course there has been transition work, but there are new conception plans and everything should be done at the same time. For example, there may be obstacles to the conception of plans, because we have the street of happiness very close to the courtyard of eternal happiness, and it can be revitalized the surrounding areas. Of the six zones?
It should be noted that the six zones concerned include Rua da Felicidade, Pier No. 23 and 25 of the Inner Port; the surrounding area of ​​Avenida Almeida Ribeiro and Rua de Cinco de Outubro; the bar area near the dock D. Carlos I; Lai Chi Vun's shipyards in Coloane, and the Zone of Fortaleza do Monte.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 00:38:44</pubDate></item><item><title>BRICS | Seventh Cimeira ends today with focus on Trump's fares</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/brics-setima-cimeira-termina-hoje-com-foco-nas-tarifas-de-trump/</link><description>Since Saturday, leaders of the countries that are part of the BRICS Group have been gathered in Rio de Janeiro for another summit designed to think about the reform of institutions and inclusion of more emerging economies, as well as the fight against Trump's rates.

Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will be the representatives of the two founding countries of the group, which represents more than 40 percent of the global population and more than 35 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) worldwide.
From China with Love
According to Chinese state agency Xinhua, Chinese prime minister promised to “expand cooperation with Brazil” in the areas of “digital and aerospace economy”. Li Qiang spoke on Saturday, as part of a meeting with Lula da Silva, noting that the country intends to “work with Brazil to take advantage of each other and expand cooperation in areas such as digital economy, green economy, scientific and technological and aerospace innovation”.
Xinhua quotes words from Li Qiang, who referred to the fact that “China is ready to work with Brazil to continue efforts to enrich the dimensions of bilateral relations and achieve more concrete results in cooperation in order to provide more benefits to both peoples”.
One of the points out of this meeting was the realization in 2026 of the year of China-Brazil culture, which provides for an intensification in cooperation in areas such as “education, youth and health”, in order to facilitate “more exchanges between peoples and strengthen public support to China-Brazil's friendship and cooperation”.
“China is willing to work with Brazil to further consolidate and deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, finance and infrastructure development within the high quality cooperation of Belt And Road [track and route]”, the Chinese prime minister, who did not forget the great flag of this BRICS Summit: multilateralism.
Thus, I read Qiang considered “the two countries as fierce defenders of multilateralism and free trade”, saying that “China is willing to improve communication and coordination with Brazil in multilateral structures such as the United Nations, BRICS and G20, work in union with developing countries to promote an equal and ordered multipolar world and universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, and provide more certainty and stability to the world. ”
On the other hand, Lula da Silva said that "Brazil is willing to deepen communication and multilateral coordination with China, to oppose unilateralism and defend multilateralism and free trade in order to promote peace and world development." After the meeting between the two leaders, “cooperation documents in areas such as tax and financial matters, artificial intelligence, alignment of development strategies and aerospace” were signed.

Cuba's debut
Cuba President Miguel Díaz-Canel also participates in the 17th BRICS Summit, being the first time Cuba has associated with this geopolitical and economic cooperation group.
Under the motto “reinforcing cooperation in the global south for more inclusive and sustainable governance”, the BRICS Summit's agenda comprises two central axes: the consolidation of cooperation between the global southern countries and the promotion of reforms in international governance mechanisms.
Created in 2009 throughout Brazil, Russia, India and China, BRICS admitted South Africa two years later and, since last year, integrates six new effective members: Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Iran, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. Brazil invited to this summit leaders from various Latin American countries, including Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay and Chile.
The statute of associate, which takes Cuba to Rio de Janeiro, was approved in October 2024 during the summit of the group held in the Russian city of Kazan, which was made official in 2025, recalled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean country.
In addition to geopolitical issues, BRICS have sought in Rio de Janeiro in the organization's economic weight, namely in the financial domain, in which they have been looking for a dollar for years for trade in the group.
The host president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, president of Brazil, stressed last Friday the importance of a mechanism with these characteristics, recognizing, however, that the current international political context is "complicated".
What is on the agenda
On the first day, the heads of state and government of the BRICS participated in two plenary sessions, particularly on "peace and security and reform of global governance" and the second relative to the strengthening of multilateralism, economic and financial affairs and artificial intelligence. "
In the latter, the revision of the ACCIORARY participation in the World Bank, the realignment of IMF shares [International Monetary Fund] and the increase in the representation of developing countries in leadership positions in international financial institutions and the importance of reforming the UN Security Council.
In addition, as it has been happening during the BRICS ministerial meetings over the past few months, an increase in unilateral unilateral unilateral protectionist measures should be made in reference to the measures announced by the President of the United States, Donald Trump; as well as an appeal to reinforce the use of local currencies in trade between the bloc countries. Today the plenary session will be on “Environment, COP30 and Global Health”.
The term BRIC was created by a Goldman Sachs analyst to refer to emerging economies who began to stand out worldwide beyond the US, and the BRICS first gathered at the level of heads in 2009. This is the first meeting that brings together the new group configuration with 11 member countries.
Brazil has mobilized about 20,000 military personnel, as well as fighters with missiles, anti-drug systems and elite shooters to ensure the safety of the event. The safety operation, called Operational Command Redeemer Set, also provides for the use of 300 vehicles, 38 armored vehicles, 18 boats and eight helicopters.</description><pubDate>2025-07-07 04:58:58</pubDate></item><item><title>AL | New Regiment prohibits deputies from disseminating content of the commissions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/al-novo-regimento-proibe-deputados-de-divulgar-conteudos-das-comissoes/</link><description>With the new Hemiciclo Regiment approved yesterday, the deputies are prohibited from publicizing the subjects discussed in the meetings of the permanent committees, except for their presidents and secretaries. The subject generated debate yesterday in the Assembly regarding the limits of what may or may not be said. Pereira Coutinho voted against this article
 
The deputies of the Legislative Assembly (AL) are now prohibited from disseminating what is discussed at the Hemiciclo Commission meetings, "anyway," with the exception of its president and secretary. These usually disclose the content of the meetings at a press conference after their holding, and this will keep up.
This new regulation arises after the vote and discussion, in general and specialty, the alteration to the al. It was one of the most discussed topics in yesterday's debate, with the deputies arguing on what may or can not be said, having José Pereira Coutinho voted against this concrete article.
The disclosure of information from the meetings, which serves to analyze in the specialty proposals of law and always steering at the closed door, was something that was not yet regulated.
Coutinho began by asking if he could disclose the information "during the plenary meeting", for example, having said that "he never heard of any deputy who had violated that duty." "There have been meetings in the past where the secretaries warned about the information that should not be disclosed and nothing has been said. We are only 33 deputies and we should think of the possibility of revealing what was discussed, because it is difficult to define borders about what can or can not be revealed and this will give rise to many discussions later," he said.
The legislator also pointed out that "it can be difficult to execute this norm" and that "the principle of transparency" should be followed.
Ho Ion Sang, who presided over to the commission that analyzed the new Al Regiment, explained that "the content of the meetings is subject to the duty of confidentiality and this matter was clarified." "The content can be said by the president of the commissions after the meetings, at the press conferences, and journalists can ask questions. In practice remains as always happened and that has given good results," he said.
Meet the meetings
Another point addressed, whether or not the permanent committees were held at the closed door, and Pereira Coutinho defended the opening to the public like what happens in Hong Kong. The AL regiment does not prohibit open meetings, but this always depends on a prior deliberation.
But Iau Teng Pio, deputy, advised against the opening of the meetings. "The purpose of the closed -door meetings is so that members of the government, advisors and deputies can argue at ease even if there is no final decision.
Kou Hoi In, president of AL, recalled that “the spirit of the norm has not been changed” and that everything will remain in it, only the ban on what deputies cannot refer outside the commissions.
"The reserved character of permanent commissions is so that everyone can speak freely and if any deputy says this or that can spoil sensations of injustice in society to deputies and this cannot happen. We have to protect deputies and ensure confidentiality."
At yesterday's meeting, there was also the discussion of the duty of the deputy to participate in all permanent committees, even in those to which he does not belong. Several deputies spoke of the need for better coordination of meetings agendas.
"In the future there may be more practical coordination because there are many meetings and law proposals. We can schedule the meetings for more deputies," he said.
Moreover, the new Al regiment prohibits deputies by "clothing or signs, banners, signs or other objects that have offensive content or political provocation, or undermine the dignity of the AL".</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 23:47:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Cape Verde | Évora family, between Macau and the rest of the world</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/03/cabo-verde-familia-evora-entre-macau-e-o-resto-do-mundo/</link><description>Tomorrow are 50 years of Cape Verde's independence, the country from which the first levada of the Évora family came out in the 1940s, towards Macao, where he won roots. Nowadays, only one member of the family remains in the territory, the cardiologist Mário Évora
 
There were once a dozen Évoras in Macao, where they arrived in the 1940s, but only Mario Évora resists, with the family repeating the migrations that mark both Cape Verde and the Macanese.
"We have been between eight and ten Évoras in Macau," Sports Medicine expert Humberto Évora told Lusa from Lisbon, where he has lived since he renovated. The maternal grandparents of Humberto (the last of the family to be born in Cape Verde) and Mário (the first to be born in Macau) arrived in the east in the late 1940s, with five of the couple's six children.
A year later, the daughter who had stayed with her husband in Cape Verde came to Macau, already with baby Humberto. The initial plan was for two years, but the couple ended up three decades and have three more children: Mario, Rui and Maria Helena.
In 1971, it was the turn of Humberto and Mário to leave to study medicine in Lisbon, but not without a great fright linked to the colonial war that had lasted a decade ago.
"As we went to the university we could postpone military inspection, but the papers did not come from Macao and we risk being considered refractory," said Humberto. The situation resolved, but Mario admitted to Lusa the fear of the mobilization. "We had this persecution, we had to go through the year not to go with the sides in the war," he explained.
“The Shock” in Lisbon
Upon arrival in Lisbon, “we were soon welcomed and integrated into the Cape Verdean student community,” said Humberto, at a time of student agitation and politics. "There were periods when it was almost daily, manifestations of students against the regime, the shock police enter the canteen inside and give some suckling," said Mario.
Humberto admitted that "it was a shock, for those who came from Macau, where there was little political culture and the colonial war was seen as a struggle against terrorists." In a summer, the young man, who was integrated into a Cape Verdean group of intervention music, left with a friend "to the overseas ride out of guitar on his back."
“I always remember the first time in France, that I saw the colonial war described on the contrary on television, the struggle for the liberation of a colonial power of occupation,” said Humberto.
Independence
When the two brothers finished the medical course, the independence of Cape Verde, on July 5, 1975, led them to the root return. "There was a movement of many of our colleagues to contribute to a new country, which was beginning to take the first steps," said Mario, then a formed cardiologist.
Also because, recalled Humberto, some of the friends of Lisbon had, however, became members of the Government of Cape Verde. "There was this possibility, but the return to Macao, a place where it had spent so long, was natural," he explained. “I was born in Cape Verde, I spent part of my life in Portugal, I grew up in Macao, I am also Macaense. I am a citizen of the world,” said Humberto.
Macanese are a Euro-Asian community, most of which Lusodescendants, with roots in Macau, although many have emigrated, due to the economic situation or fear created by the transition from Portugal Administration to China in 1999.
From the Évora brothers, Rui, engineer, left before the transition to Cape Verde, where he even worked on the project of the Hotel-Casino that Macau's businessman David Chow built on the beach, but was inaugurated.
The younger sister, Maria Helena, expert in documentary sciences who even worked in the historical archive of Macau, is currently in the City Council of Oeiras. The children “are all out” between the United Kingdom, Cape Verde and Portugal, said Mario. "Now the world is smaller and it is going where there are opportunities," he said.
Humberto also faces migrations "as a natural process, not only for Cape Verdeans, but even to the Macanese."
Nothing that has prevented the two brothers from keeping their ties with the archipelago. Humberto divides the time between Portugal and Cape Verde, and has been the official doctor of Cape Verdean sports for decades to the main international competitions.
Mario was one of the founders-and president for ten years-of the Macau-Cabo Green Friendship Association. "We had here Ildo Lobo, Tito Paris, and my cousin," said the cardiologist, before taking a break and adds, with a smile: "Cesaria Évora."</description><pubDate>2025-07-03 23:18:00</pubDate></item><item><title>WHO | Study reveals that one in six people in the world feels</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/oms-estudo-revela-que-uma-em-cada-seis-pessoas-no-mundo-sente-se-so/</link><description>A World Health Organization report states that loneliness is a growing problem. Based on a study conducted between 2014 and 2023, the document concluded that one in six people in the world feel alone, with emphasis on young people from 13 to 29 years old. The Southeast Asian region has, however, less problematic values
 
More and more is spoken of the devastating impact of loneliness as a potentializing cause of diseases. This time, a report from the World Health Organization (WHO), released on Monday and carried out by the Social Connection Commission, brings data on the problem, concluding that one in six people say he feels alone, a state that is not synonymous with being alone.
Moreover, the problem is greater in younger ones, because one in five says it feels alone, which shows that one fifth of the world's population between 13 and 29 years old says it feels loneliness.
The study, entitled “From Solitude to Social Connection - tracing a path to healthier societies: WHO Commission on Social Connection Commission”, focuses on 2013 and 2024, thus encompassing the pandemic, a period when most of the world populations faced confinement periods, some of them alone in their dwellings. The study was sent to journalists from 194 WHO member countries, and the data were dealt with in line with other works already done on the subject and with the support of experts from around the world, including from China. Bin Yu, from the Medical College Tianjin University, was one of the project participants.
The report points out that between 2014 and 2023 "it is estimated that 16 percent of people around the world-one in six-felt loneliness," something that "affects all ages and regions." However, it is a “more common feeling among adolescents and young adults”, with a rate of 20.9 percent of young people between 13 and 17 years old, while the rate reduces slightly to 17.4 percent in the case of young adults from 18 to 29 years.
The feeling of loneliness "decreases with age", and is also "more common in low-income countries, where almost one in four people (24 percent) claimed to feel lonely."
The WHO study also points out that “the highest rates are in the WHO African region”, with 24 percent; Following the regions of the Eastern Mediterranean (21 percent), and in Southeast Asia this feeling is less felt by respondents, registering only 18 percent.
"The European region has the lowest rate, with about ten percent," says WHO, which distinguishes loneliness of social isolation. In this field, “data is more limited”, but the isolation of the elderly stands out. "Estimates suggest that 25-34 percent of the elderly are socially isolated," it is data on the years between 1990 and 2022.
When it comes to adulthood, from 30 to 59 years, the percentage of people who feel only low to 15.1 percent, and in people 60 years or older, with 11.8 percent.
Regarding gender, “estimated rates of loneliness in women and men are similar (16.1 and 15.4 percent, respectively), with the highest estimated differences between adolescents (24.3 percent between women and 17.2 percent between men) and the elderly (13 percent between women and 9.9 percent among men)”.
Who else feels
The report states that nowadays “social disconnection is widespread in all regions and in all age groups”, with consequences that are “serious and underestimated, affecting mortality, physical and mental health, well-being, education, economy and society in general”. "Its widespread occurrence and its serious consequences make it a serious issue of global public health," it is mentioned.
And who feels more alone? The WHO highlights “marginalized groups”, namely “people with disabilities, lesbians, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer (or sometimes in question) and other individuals (LGBTIQ+) and migrants”. These people “are more likely to feel loneliness and isolation than other groups”, making it the caveat that “previous data are too limited to determine whether social isolation and solitude rates have increased or decreased”.
In the case of disabled people, scenarios persist such as being unable to “access social facilities and take advantage of opportunities due to physical barriers in buildings, limited access to transportation and lack of affordable information and communication, while others face structural stigma that limits their job opportunities or other sociocultural barriers that lead to lower level of education, less stable relationships and more precarious housing conditions”.
"Many factors" are identified that lead people to feel alone, namely "modernization, industrialization and technological changes", and may be "responsible for what, often, it is presumed to be an increase in social isolation and loneliness, but most remain without proof."
"We know that certain factors increase the risk of individuals suffering from social disconnection. These include poor physical or mental health (especially depression), personality traits such as neuroticism, not having a partner or being single, living alone and characteristics of the built environment, such as poor access to public transport. The impact of digital technology is not yet clear, but experts recommend caution, especially to protect the mental health and well-being of young people." study.
The WHO highlights, throughout the text, how it is difficult to quantify feelings of loneliness, being relatively recent this type of definitions and, above all, differentiation between the feeling of feeling alone and being effectively only. The report includes testimonies from people from various countries and cultures that describe that, even though they are with a partner or friends, they feel alone in a scenario caused by many factors.
In the case of young people, "the finding of high loneliness rates between adolescents is consistent with the results of previous research, although the result may be subject to both developmental and methodological considerations."
“As loneliness results from a perceived discrepancy between real and desired or expected social connections, the highest rate in adolescence can be due to higher expectations of social connections during the development phase, which is marked by significant emotional and psychological changes. The elderly report a comparatively greater satisfaction with their social relations. According to these estimates, the elderly have the lower rates of loneliness, the elderly. which contradicts previous studies that enhanced the elderly as the age range with some of the highest rates. This may be due to the limited availability and quality of the previous data on the elderly, ”is explained.
The study highlights, however, that it is “possible that the prevalence of loneliness is greater among adults over 80 or older”, which is a “consistent conclusion with previous studies, in which there was a distribution in the form of 'U' of loneliness among older adults”.
More than 800 thousand deaths
We are in an era where so -called social health is at risk, being considered by WHO as "a vital but often neglected, health, as essential as physical and mental health."
"Social relations can reduce the risk of disease, increase life expectancy and strengthen the fabric of communities and society. Social relations improve life, giving us meaning and a feeling of belonging," it is also read, being mentioned that today loneliness affects one in six people worldwide and causes "about 871,000 deaths annually (2014-2019)".
"New estimates suggest that loneliness alone may be responsible for about 871,000 deaths a year. The economic cost of these comprehensive impacts on society is just starting to be understood. Estimates suggest substantial costs for employers, health systems and individuals. Stronger social connections provide important protection in health, social and economic domains," he reads.
The report points out that many of these issues only now begin to be perceived and analyzed. "This has probably been happening for years, but the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the growing concern for digital technology has brought more attention to the issue, including governments," he is explained.
The WHO also points to a correlation between poverty or low income and the feeling of loneliness.
"In general, the lower the performance group in a country, the higher the loneliness rate. It is estimated that low-yielding countries have the higher (24.3 percent), followed by the medium-low yield countries (19.3 percent), medium-high performance countries (12.1 percent) and high-performance countries (10.6 percent)," can be read.
Despite some worrying scenarios, WHO leaves some suggestions and even says that "there is hope" to get around the problem. "There are effective strategies for promoting social connection and these must be expanded," for example, by the "regular monitoring of the prevalence of social connection, social isolation and solitude at the global, regional and national level." This monitoring should be viewed as "a high priority", allowing "to track progress and measure the impact of strategies to deal with the issue."
It is also suggested the “international development and adoption of reliable measuring instruments, interculturally valid for social connection, social isolation and loneliness”, and as a priority ”should be viewed the creation“ of an instrument to measure social connection, as conceived in this report: in the three dimensions of structure, function and quality ”.
The study was based on reference documents on global and regional estimates of the prevalence of loneliness and mortality due to loneliness, “the first of this type”; a global review of political documents; Network mapping and analysis, the inclusion of 64 experiences experienced by people in relation to social connection, social isolation and loneliness, as well as “high quality evidence, prioritizing systematic revisions, meta-analysis and large-scale multinational studies”, without forgetting the experience of the WHO technical advisory group itself, “composed of 20 renowned global experts”.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 23:24:44</pubDate></item><item><title>China-Portuguese | Chengdu Pavilion shows Portuguese products</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/china-portugal-pavilhao-em-chengdu-mostra-produtos-portugueses/</link><description>In the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion venture in Chengdu, pavilions for foreign countries and entrepreneurs who want to establish business in China are installed. Portugal is also there, represented by the Portugal Pavilion, but according to manager Ângelo Sousa, there is a lack of support from the Portuguese government and strength to combat competition
 
“For us there are no barriers between Portugal and China. We are 365 days here and there.” This is the way the objectives of the team that is behind the Portugal Pavilion present at the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion are presented in Chengdu and which is managed by two partners: Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa.
The two realized that the Shanghai zone had reached a saturation point in the trade of products and that it was necessary to go more to the interior of the country to try to sell things as Portuguese as wine, cod or olive oil.
HM talked to Yinhui Tui about this project on the fringes of a lunch in Lisbon by the Friends of the New Seda Route Association, chaired by Fernanda Ilhéu. The event served precisely for Yinhui Tui to present the objectives of the Portugal Pavilion and try to capture business interests.
“This is a very important market for Portuguese products. In China we have separated the country [in commercial terms] in four markets. We have the region of Beijing and Shanghai, which we call 'Yangtze River Economic Zone', and 'Pearl River Economic Zone'. The fourth zone is composed by the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing and which is a new economic area established in 2020. Portuguese have a lot of potential in these markets, ”he said.
The entrepreneur recalls that the marketing of Portuguese products is still below the one that is done by French, Spanish or other countries, but when the Chinese buyer discovers wine or olive oil, he is surprised.
"In Shanghai, for example, some customers already have their opinion on French or Australians. But many think that Portuguese products have more quality," said Yinhui Tui, noting that in the area where the Portugal Pavilion operates in Sichuan province, "people are a little more conservative and prefer to try, prove and feel before buying."
"Our pavilion is next to the French pavilion and we often see customers opt for French wine. But when they go through our pavilion, they see our brands and ask what we have. When they realize that we have cheaper wine compared to French, they are surprised and say it is better, and then buy."
This responsible explains that the population in the fourth economic zone is 130 million people, much more than the number of people living in the Iberian Peninsula. "Then I think it's a market with a lot of potential," he said.
The Role of Lusosino
Yinhui Tui and Ângelo Freitas de Sousa created Lusosino that it acts as the managing entity of the pavilion, which was born “with the intention of promoting Portuguese products in the Great Market of China”. Thus, there is a “showroom” of very Portuguese products, representing some brands known as is the case of Vieira crackers, Esporão wine, Sal Marnoto, the Prisca jams or Vista Alegre, among others. It is in this pavilion that "exhibitors display the best products, buyers discover trends and where they both find the conditions to realize business." Moreover, Lusosino, through this pavilion, helps Portuguese entrepreneurs in marketing campaigns and in the best way to contact potential Chinese customers.
Specifically, Lusosino promises to perform “producer and brands records, commercial representation, market analysis, market support and preparation, among other services”, reads on the website.
However, and according to Ângelo Freitas de Sousa to HM, there are many obstacles to putting Portuguese products in China. “[The Chengdu and Chongqing zone] has the advantage of being a growing market that is not overloaded with exporters and has no addictions as happens in the Shanghai zone. It is a very large market and where there are many producers.” By addictions, the entrepreneur refers to “competition” from other countries and buying habits of Chinese customers, who are faster looking for products from other nationalities than from Portugal. "There are habits of certain brands that are implemented and people don't even look at others or experience them."
The Portuguese Pavilion project began with an idea of ​​Ângelo Ferreira de Sousa, who has a Chinese wife who helps him in the business. “I met Yinhui Tui, he liked Portuguese products, we were friends and then we ended up joining energy,” he said, explaining that the interior of the country is still knowing foreign products, not just Portuguese.
"The Shanghai zone has nowhere to grow and this is a growing economic zone. There are many factories that are moving to Chengdu, so there will be more development," he said.
Absence of marketing
The Portuguese entrepreneur regrets that the Portuguese authorities have given little support to the project, except for any follow -up by AICEP - Agency for Investment and Foreign Trade of Portugal.
"All the investment was made by us and we have not had a lot of support. We had some help from AICEP, but nothing special. We do fairs, the showrooms, to prove and know our products in major cities," said Angelo Ferreira de Sousa.
The entrepreneur also regrets that, despite the relationship of hundreds of years between Portugal and China, there is still flaws in the commercial strategy for the export of Portuguese products in the country. "The Spaniards are much further ahead than us," he said.
Regarding the role of Macao as a platform, the entrepreneur says it is equally difficult to bring products from Portugal to China or Macau to China, due to lack of customs agreements and little flexibility.
"It is not because we call Macau that I can, for example, putting sausages, cod or preserves in China, or other Portuguese products. To pass from Portugal to Macau is easy, but it is no longer so easy to take after Portuguese products from Macau to China. We have not been able to do much through Macau, but we have not sought much," he said.
At the presentation in Lisbon, Yinhui Tui advanced some figures behind the construction of the Euro-Asia National Commodity Pavillion, and help to understand their size: about 70 billion euros of investment and a space of 300,000 cubic meters. The Portugal Pavilion does not only do contact sessions or fairs: if a businessman wants to leave tons of products there, he can do so. Then the pavilion is in charge of distribution through several areas of China. “In the southern market, closer to Macao, there is a lot of competition in some areas, so it should be betting inside China,” said Yinhui Tui, referring to the potential and factor novelty that exists in some areas of the country regarding commerce.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 00:50:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Check | Will make distribution to the elderly and pensioners</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/10/cheque-ias-vai-fazer-distribuicao-a-idosos-e-pensionistas/</link><description>The Institute of Social Action (IAS) will distribute the pecuniary reimbursement of 2025 to qualified residents to receive subsidies for the elderly and disability.

According to Chan Chak Mo, quoted by the newspaper or Mun, the new law will introduce into the Macao planning “innovative legal concepts” such as the possibility of transferring to the territory funds existing in other jurisdictions.
The deputy and president of the 2nd Permanent Committee of the Legislative Assembly also said he believed that the approval of the diploma will allow Macau to maintain the pace of international development, attract more funds and financial institutions and develop as a financial market.
Chan Chan Mo also pointed out that the new law will follow international standards and allow greater protection to investors, which found it fundamental for them to consider Macau as a safe place to invest. In addition, future law is seen as a way to improve the internal regulation system and remove bureaucratic obstacles to the development of investment funds.
The deputy argued that the law has a different regulation for public and private investment funds and follows examples of the interior, Hong Kong and Mountain Island.
According to the information provided by the government to the deputies, there is currently only one investment fund in Macao, with a capital of about 200 million Renminbis. In addition, another request was filed to start a fund with an investment of 100 million Renminbis, which is being analyzed by the Monetary Authority of Macao.</description><pubDate>2025-07-10 00:07:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Foundation | André Ritchie at the Curators Council</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/10/fundacao-macau-andre-ritchie-no-conselho-de-curadores/</link><description>The chief executive will keep Wu Zhiliang as president of the Macau Foundation, a position he has been in.

China will issue national obligations in Macao, worth 6 billion Yuan, to “support the development of the obligation of the obligation” of the MSAR, was announced yesterday.
"The Ministry of Finance of the Government of the Popular Republic of China and the Government of the Special Administrative Region of Macao today announced [yesterday] that the central government will issue national obligations in Macao, worth six billion RMB [Renminbis]," can be read in a statement of the media. The issue, intended for institutional investors, will be made on July 16, adds the office.
"Continuous issuance of national obligations in Macao demonstrates the importance and support of the central government regarding the cultivation of the new areas of financial activities in Macau, such as the obligationary market, and the promotion of diversified development of the economy of Macao," says the government of Raem, which greeted the decision of finances in Beijing.
The emission “will help attract international investors to participate in the Macao's obligationary market, promote the development of the Offshore market from RMB in Macao and will deepen the financial cooperation between the interior of China and Macau,” he was added.
Repeated Acts
In October, China had already issued Macao debt securities worth 5 billion Yuan. The Macao government has mentioned the possible creation of a 'offshore' stock market, called Renminbi, linked to the role that the region has taken as a platform for commercial and financial services between China and Portuguese -speaking countries.
In January, Macau's financial regulator said the central banks of Angola and Timor -Leste are interested in issuing public debt on the MSAR to attract investors from mainland China.
Henrietta Lau Hang Kun, a member of the Board of the Monetary Authority of Macao, said the institution has been trying to promote the territory as "a financial service platform with Lusophone countries."
"For now, we are still negotiating with Lusophone countries" so that the debt issuance "passes here, through Macao, to the [China] market," added Henrietta Lau. In May 2019, Portugal became the first country in the eurozone to issue debt in Chinese currency, worth 2 billion Renminbis.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 23:59:37</pubDate></item><item><title>National Games | Ron Lam regrets little participation of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/jogos-nacionais-ron-lam-lamenta-pouca-participacao-de-macau/</link><description>Deputy Ron Lam appealed yesterday to the period before the order of the debate day at AL to talk about Macau's little participation in some modalities on the occasion of the territory of the 15th edition of the National Games.
The event includes 34 sports competition and 23 popular modalities, and guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau can participate. However, according to the deputy, on May 20, the Sports Institute (ID) “announced that Macao would only participate in 19 sports competitions and 12 modalities for the public, that is, in terms of proportion, corresponds to a participation rate of less than 60 percent of the modalities”.
The deputy pointed out that "the government has not yet announced which modalities in which Macau will participate, wasting the unique opportunity of the population of Macau to participate in national events," unlike Hong Kong, which began in January this year "the selection process in 23 modalities for the public, with a view to allowing the registration of all qualified residents".
“It is noteworthy that the modalities for the public are not for the participation of professional athletes. For example, the Badminton modality is divided into four age groups, from 25 to 64 years old. Does Macau have no participant who can participate in this modality?”, Asked the deputy, who suggests the creation of a “formal means for the registration of athletes interested in participating in national games and adopting uniform criteria, justice and transparent for the team selection that will represent Macau. ”</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 23:56:32</pubDate></item><item><title>AL | New status of deputies voted in general</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/al-novo-estatuto-dos-deputados-votado-na-generalidade/</link><description>Yesterday the changes to a 2000 law related to the Legislature and the Statute of the Deputies to the Legislative Assembly (AL) was approved in general and which clarifies, among other matters, the loss of mandates.

Donald Trump
For Elon, AI is, on the contrary, an existential threat to be controlled and contained, to prevent its power from freeing and annihiles human consciousness. In short, which for Trump is the door of the stars, for Musk is the way for hell not even very paved with good intentions. Altman knows, and so it touches the right strings.
And it puts Elon "the most inspiring entrepreneur of our time," according to the definition of the OpenAi chief in the face of a choice, to follow the rules of the game written by the tycoon, thus content to be one of the many names written in his Cencelli manual, or quit everything and persecuting dreams of "universal palkingness." There is no third option. But the tension points between the founder of Spacex and the stargate men do not end here. Musk didn't like Trump's joke about Larry Ellison either and Tiktok. Asked about the possibility of buying the Chinese application by the businessman, the US president initially avoided responding. But then he replied that he wouldn't mind either if Oracle bought him by stating that "I would also like Larry to buy him."
The Tiktok case, which has been accelerating in recent months, can therefore be another element of friction between Musk and Stargate men. After avoiding the closure of the application, prolonging its service life for seventy -five days, Trump launched his proposal. Fifty percent of the Chinese social network should end in American hands. Compared to 2020, when the intention actually seemed to ban the "Chinese application", the president changed his position.
The merit is also from his granddaughter Kai who, as a skilled golfer and content creator, made Tiktok come 'in the heart', who believes the application was fundamental along with his frequency of podcasts, suggested by the young Barron to win the vows of young people. Therefore, the president would not want to ban it, but to include it in a broader deal with Beijing. Too bad Musk anticipated. The news, in fact, never commented by Elon, of a possible interest of the founder of Spacex in the purchase of the application was provided to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal by "Chinese authorities" not specified.
Attention, these are not personalities linked to the Chinese company Bytedance, which controls Tiktok and with whom Elon Musk continues to maintain narrow relationships. These figures defined musk as a perfect "intermediate", implying that the two parts concerned that, China and the United States could trust him. And looking well, Elon's only tweet really seems like a negotiation opening because he says that "I have never been in favor of Tiktok's ban, but I do not understand why it can operate in the United States and the X cannot operate in China."
Elon had made his proposal that he guarantees to the president Tiktok, but exchanges, open the Chinese market to X. It was at this time that Trump intervened, specifying that at least officially the sale of Tiktok should be negotiated with Bytedance, not "Chinese authorities" not being better specified. And, above all, the president points out that the app can also be quietly bought by Larry Ellison, who, incidentally, manages the Tiktok cloud in the United States through Oracle and was very close to buying it in 2019.
Which means' Elon, we don't need you. Neither for the AI ​​nor for Tiktok ». SIC Transit Gloria Mundi? Not yet. But Musk is trapped. And in his ears they resonate both Altman's "Trump or Humanity" dilemma and Masayoshi Son's categorical imperative, known as the "This is not just business." In short, it's time to put the United States first.
Regardless of transplanetary, universalist or more prosaically Chinese dreams. Trump made his play, crowning himself "technological king" of America. Now it will be up to the great technology tycoons to organize themselves in accordance. If they want to challenge each other with innovation, that's fine. If Zuckerberg, although excluded from Stargate, considers investing sixty -five billion in AI, very well. The president will not hurt those who were left out of the star door. On the contrary, as a true medieval sovereign, it will offer water, earth and deregulation. But vassalage relations and national interest should not be questioned. Anyone who thinks about using politics to pursue their interests exclusively, whether Martians or Chinese, is wrong.
And those who believe that his star can shine more than the president's is very mistaken, because Donald is convinced that "it was saved by God to make America big again." Obviously, it will not be easy. The technological companies that Trump is trying to federate are simply very powerful. And it is always the Lord who depends on the servant, especially if the latter is able to produce technological gadgets capable of leading humanity to Mars or overcoming human intelligence.
Stargate is therefore a social experience, before being economic, technological and geopolitical. If the protagonists of American technology ie a dozen billionaires, all with obvious behavioral disorders are willing to collaborate with each other and with the government, then the American dream could be reprogrammed. If, on the contrary, chaos and grudge prevail, America will die, collapsing itself. Exactly as a star.</description><pubDate>2025-07-10 00:32:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Promote moderately diversified economic development</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/promover-o-desenvolvimento-economico-moderadamente-diversificado/</link><description>Macao opportunities and responsibilities from the perspective of young entrepreneurship
Wun Kong Law *
Kacee Ting Wong **
It is a widely recognized fact that the Macao game sector is under increasing pressure from the emergence of new game centers in neighboring regions. Even more worrying is the so -called “exclusion effect” caused by the excessive preponderance of the game industry, which makes it difficult to attract talent and the growth of game -related sectors, generating structural imbalances and obscuring the prospects of sustainable economic development. At this key transition moment, Macao must break decisively with the habit of rooted dependence over the years and adopt an innovation posture and initiative to promote moderate economic diversification.
This way is not just the right way to ensure robust long-term development, but it is an inevitable strategic choice for Macao to be proactively in the new competitive scenario. The strong commitment of the Government of the Special Administrative Region (MSAR) in the development of Mountain Island (Hengqin) and support for local entrepreneurs demonstrates that economic diversification has become one of the priorities of current governance.
For a long time, the high profits from the game sector generated, in some individuals and local companies, a dependence mindset, leading to a passive attitude of waiting for opportunities within the game's value chain, to the detriment of an active exploitation of new emerging sectors. This conservative mindset, resembling invisible currents, not only limits Macao's progress on the way to economic diversification and social innovation, but also weakens its ability to resistance to external shocks.
It deserves attention that certain companies remain too faithful to their traditional operational models, neglecting the formation of their innovation capacity and improving their adaptation to market dynamics. Once the external environment changes, they are severely affected, highlighting the urgency of transforming mental models and welcoming a culture of renewal.
Therefore, we argue that the commitment of business fabric in promoting economic diversification is as essential as - or even more pressing - the efforts of the government government to reduce the dependence of the game sector. Young local entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises should assume a central role, breaking with the mindset of comfort and becoming the driving force of industrial transformation and innovative development.
A paradigmatic example is that of Mr. Fu Tanglong, president of the Macao Digital Industry Research Institute and Executive Vice President of the Macao Living Transmission Association. Since the beginning of the Great Bay initiative in 2019, Mr. Fu has decided to launch himself inside China to undertake, moved by his confidence in electronic trade, actively exploring the economic opportunities provided by new technologies.
Through its training programs, it assisted more than 350 small and medium -sized companies in its digital conversion and provided training in digital marketing and in -moving transmission to about 4,000 young people. This practice demonstrates well the entrepreneurial spirit that combines the courage to explore the strategic vision with the use of comparative advantages. His success experience proves that, with proper professional training and taking advantage of Macao's unique geographical position and political environment, young people can open new horizons in electronic trade, developing personal careers and contributing to the region's economic transformation. In 2023 alone, the Mr. FU -led association helped Macao's local traders reach a sales volume of over $ 16 million (source: macaubusiness.com, December 10, 2024, “the entrepreneurship journey of a young man from Macao”).
Other inspiring examples of young entrepreneurs abound. Mrs. Huang Yin has been dedicated to the promotion and dissemination of traditional Chinese medicine in the territory; Mrs. Chan Nga Law, in turn, founded the company E.C. Film Production Company Limited, contributing in recent years to the development of the Macao film industry; And young talents like Leng Ka Chan and Oscar Chan Tianlan were elected in August 2024 by Macau Post as "great bay excellence entrepreneurs." These young entrepreneurs, actively exploring the unique cultural and historical resources of Macao and developing projects with strong local identity, prove the immense potential of innovation anchored in tradition. These success cases are inspired by companies to reinforce investment in research and development, valuing Macau's historical-cultural heritage and combining their traditional specificities with contemporary creativity, with a view to creating innovative products with macanese identity.
The active response of these individuals to the “Moderately Diversified Economic Development Plan 2024–2028” and the Government of the Government guidelines represents, in practice, the realization of the “four hopes” expressed by President XI Jinping in December 2024: to boost moderate diversification of the economy; Raise the effectiveness of governance of the special administrative region; Build opening platforms to the highest level outside; and safeguard social stability and harmony. Strategic attention attributed to the development of Mountain Island clearly reflects the prominent place that economic diversification occupies in the current governance. According to statistical data, the Guangdong-Macau in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin already hosts more than 56,000 commercial entities and more than 10,000 technological companies, constituting a fundamental pillar for Macao's economic transformation.
The new Government of MSA has attributes great importance to the expansion of economic and commercial relations with Portuguese -speaking countries, having foreseen, in its first year, an official mission to Portugal. Secretary for Economics and Finance, Mr. Tai Kin IP, recently stressed that the role of Macao as a bridge between China and Lusophone countries is irreplaceable. It also reiterated that the region will enhance its connection platform, with emphasis on the development of the technological industry as a strategic vector to achieve economic diversification (China Daily, June 27, 2025). It is also important to mark the growing role of macanese students in Portugal, who have become dynamic protagonists of the exchange between Chinese and Portuguese societies.
Promoting a renewal of mentalities requires the collective effort of all sectors of Macanese society and a coordinated advance on multiple fronts. Individual, Macao residents should cultivate a prospective view, break with conventional professional models and acquire emerging sectors specialized skills such as digital economy, creative industries or traditional Chinese medicine, continually reinforcing their competitive advantage. Companies, as protagonists of economic development, should abandon passivity, adopt a proactive posture of transformation, reinforce investments in technological innovation and product investigation, and strengthen cooperation with the interior of China and international markets. At the same time, they should seek to deepen their connections with the large bay and the outdoor markets, converting Macao's advantages as a platform into concrete business opportunities.
In fact, the private sector, for its efficiency, flexibility and competitive orientation, plays a particularly relevant role in the realization of economic diversification. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that many companies face the problem of high financing costs, which can limit their investment capacity - as has been widely discussed, including academic publications such as the Blue Sky Blog of Columbia University Law School. To respond to this difficulty, the Government of MSA has launched the “Young Entrepreneurship Support Plan”, offering interest-free loans to young people with entrepreneurial spirit but with limited resources, thus providing them with substantial support. This measure translates the governance view of paving the way to youth and reinforces the social consensus that young people should take advantage of this favorable conjuncture and get out of their “comfort zone”.
Most importantly, young people, who live this crucial moment of transition, must consciously assume the historical mission of leading Macao towards a model of sustainable and diverse economic development. Instead of questioning “what can Macau do for me?”, Should question “What can I do for Macau and my country?”, Cultivating an attitude of initiative and service, making national and regional prosperity its vocation.
The new generation should break free from the dependence on a single job in the game sector and widen their professional horizons, betting on continuous learning and improving their skills-not only as a requirement for personal development, but also as imperative to optimize the region's talent structure and promote social progress. From the national strategic point of view, the development of Hengqin will also contribute to the deep integration of Macao in the Great Bay. The firm and continuous application of President Xi Jinping's important guidelines will allow Macau to safely follow the right path traced by national policies towards a promising and predictable future.
As history teaches us, the periods of difficulty are also aptly moments for consensus consolidation and overcoming with determination. Macao is in a historic crossroads. Breaking with inertia, renewing concepts and redefining the course of development is not just urgent - it is unavoidable. In this context of transformation, we must all firmly support the policies of the Government of MSAR in the economic and social domains. Given the inevitable challenges of economic transition, the Macanese society must unite, strive with conviction in the process of diversification, and promote, with innovative spirit and social cohesion, the modernization of the productive structure.
If, as Dickens wrote, the worst times are also the best, then Macanese entrepreneurs should not lose confidence in the face of adversities, but will face them with courage and creativity, adopting innovative management models capable of responding to the challenges of economic transition and technological progress. Society as a whole should abandon immobilism, face changes with bravery and turn difficulties into opportunities. Only with the concerted action of individuals, companies and authorities will it be possible to take steady steps on the moderately diverse economic development, writing a new chapter in the history of Macao - a lasting prosperity chapter and sustainable progress.

This decision is not only an attack on human rights - it is also a direct reflection of ignorance and fear in the face of diversity. In response, about 200,000 people took to the streets of Budapest to celebrate pride. Under the risk of being detained and even facing prison penalties up to a year, they were proudly fearless, convinced that they are on the right side of the story.
In this context, it is worth revisiting a simple but powerful didactic tool that has been used in schools and educational spaces for years to explain the complexity of human identity: GenderBread Person, a pun with gingerbread - the ginger ginger cookie.
The ginger person is a graphic representation that uses this figure of American popular culture - the head ginger cookie, trunk and limbs - to uncomplicate often misunderstood concepts: gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation and biological sex. Through this friendly figure, it is taught that these four dimensions are distinct but interconnected-and that, above all, do not fit rigid binarisms.
Unfortunately, for leaders like Orbán and for so many others in the world, this nuance is precisely what scares the most. In a world where human diversity becomes increasingly visible, the response of certain governments has been silencing and repression. They face him like a threat. Hungary, by banning the marches of LGBTQIA+pride, is not just denying public space to a vulnerable community - is denying its own social reality.
Genderbread explains things that should be simple: a person can be born with male biological characteristics, identify himself as a woman, express himself in a non-binary manner, and feel attraction to another man. It is a factual description of human complexity. In Hungary, in 2021 a law was passed that prohibits the “promotion” of LGBTQIA+ content with minors, in a clear attempt to associate gender identity and sexual orientation with taboo themes. The logic is old and spent: if we don't talk about, you may disappear. But LGBTQia+ people are not modern inventions - they are part of humanity forever. Denying their existence does not eliminate them; It only aggravates suffering, isolation and reinforces the urgency of resistance.
Europe has been watching, in recent years, a dangerous growth of populist movements that feed hatred and exclusion. Hungary is just an example of how this discourse can become state policy. Educating for diversity is the most effective antidote against extremism. Teaching children (and adults) that being different is not wrong, that the genre is not just about the binary man-man, and that love does not know rules imposed by ideologies-all this is a way to build more just and more human societies.
The fear that these leaders demonstrate is no more than refusing to accept the complexity of the human condition. Their ideological rigidity prevents them from recognizing that individual freedom and diversity are not threats-they are fundamental pillars of a healthy society. Today, more than ever, we need more ginger people in schools - and less stone leaders in the governments of this world.</description><pubDate>2025-07-09 01:08:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Highly qualified investigator delivers food (I)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/07/investigador-altamente-qualificado-entrega-comida-i/</link><description>Recently, the online press has widely released the history of Chinese academic, Ding Yuanzhao (丁遠昭).
In 2004, Ding Yuanzhao got 700 points out of 750 in the admission exam to higher education in mainland China and joined Tsinghua University to take baccalaureate in chemical and bio-industrial engineering. After graduation, he was admitted to the University of Beijing and made his master's degree in Energy Resources Engineering. Later, he obtained his doctorate in biology at the Nanyang Technology University in Singapore. In 2018, he joined Oxford University in the United Kingdom to take a master's degree in biodiversity. Subsequently, he worked as a researcher in a postdoctoral degree at the National University of Singapore.
In March 2024, the contract as an investigator came to an end, was not renewed, and Ding started working as a food delivery in Singapore. It works 11 or 12 hours a day, and earns an average of $ 50 to $ 100 (about $ 40 to $ 80) and can earn up to 254 dollars of Singapore (about 200 US dollars) on Sundays.
This case caused a wide debate after Ding filmed and loaded a video on the internet. In the video, it showed the various academic certificates and advised candidates for joining the universities of mainland China, as follows:
"The results of the exams are not everything. Do not get pessimistic if they do not have good grades. The good results do not mean that they will have the future guaranteed. The works are not very different. Food deliveries is a good choice to serve society and to support, just work hard that we are rewarded."
In another video, Ding advises experts to pay attention to the safety of people who deliver food.
Ding's case caused a lighted discussion in Chinese society. The main reason is the disparity between its academic level and its current profession. This disparity draws attention to the problem of cultural conflict in Chinese society. Since the most remote times, China has always been focused on education. Cultured people can serve as members of the government and give wide to all their ambition. Another purpose of education is to cultivate the character, so there is a saying that says “training begins with learning and learning with reading.” (立身以立學為先 ， 立學以讀書為本)
In Europe, education focuses on the transmission of knowledge and encouraging students to think independently and innovatively. Universities are the bastion of knowledge and particularly value scientific research. Scientific research leads to innovation and innovation benefits society. This is the main objective of education, which has no relation to careers that many students choose after graduation.
Ding became a food delivery man after obtaining a doctorate. This disparity between formation and the current profession collides with the principles of traditional Chinese culture and it is inevitable that it has caused lit debates. This case is not only a story, but also a mirror that reflects issues such as the meaning of education, social values ​​and personal attitudes.
First, having passed a university researcher the food delivery, will Ding have questioned the usefulness of having obtained several academic degrees? Why go to the university? To answer this question, we cannot only consider personal experience, but a social perspective.
Knowledge is a personal property. It is not measured in terms of money, but in the evolution it causes in humans. Students receive education at the university to obtain more knowledge, to inherit an “intangible” property and enrich their spirits. The knowledge obtained at the University becomes professional knowledge, so professionals, such as doctors, lawyers and accountants, have to receive university education. After acquiring professional knowledge, the right way will be to embrace a profession where they give good use to the training they received. Only with talented and specialized people can social development exist, and only with talented and specialized researchers can new inventions emerge, which is also very necessary in all societies. Therefore, students who received university education should pursue careers other than those who have not received it and it is impossible for “future work to be not that different.”
Ding has a doctorate and is a person with a high degree of education. Working as a food delivery is obviously the result of a maladjustment between your formation and your current profession; This maladjustment results in the waste of talented people and society loses it. Ding's difficulty in finding a work compatible with his academic qualifications was a matter of lack of opportunities and was part of his life course. When in the future you find a work worthy of your background, you can again use your knowledge and learn to make them useful. Therefore, it is not correct to confuse the objective of education with the circumstances of life.
Next week, we will continue to deepen this story.

The new number has six visual projects, two of them black and white, which open and close the magazine.
Jane Xu's first, who is entitled “Black Enlivened by Colors”, offers a portrait of female intimacy, in line with the artist's visual practice and his thematic research.
In a different way, but still black and white, João Palla concludes in this number of the magazine the second part of his project “White Gold Whispers”. “The poetic expression of its visual proposal articulates perfectly with the aesthetic effect obtained with the contrast between black and white,” says the event organization
The four other visual projects, in color, test different approaches to chromatic and thematic composition. Jorge Veiga Alves presents “Memories of Macau”, seeking to reinforce the memory effect in the approach to the contemplation of traditional spaces, namely religious in nature.
Field and city
José Luís de Sales Marques' second color project is dedicated to the famous procession of Senhor dos Passos, which takes place in Macau, underlining the role of this event, not only in the social and cultural context of the city, but also in its integration into the public space of Macao.
In the third project, António Duarte Mil-Homens presents us a contemplative time in “Sunset, Moonrise”, addressing the nature and essence of the Alentejo landscape. The succession of color marks the hours and differentiates impressions, which conform the immensity of the Alentejo plain and its morphology.
In the fourth project, color also plays a key role in its expressiveness and visual conformation: Tang Kuok Hou's “photosynthesis” proposes a social and aesthetic exploitation of the city of Macao, reinforcing its role as a place of photographic study par excellence, which has justified a multitude of various approaches, both thematic and sociological or formal, given its expressive richness.</description><pubDate>2025-07-10 00:35:04</pubDate></item><item><title>CCM | Chopin and Debussy close season of the Macau Orchestra</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/10/ccm-chopin-e-debussy-fecham-temporada-da-orquestra-de-macau/</link><description>On July 27, the Macao Cultural Center hosts the concert that ends the 2024-2025 season of the Macao Orchestra.

Macau Urban Renewal has announced that the six apartment blocks have already been licensed for use and that the next step will be to deliver the fractions to buyers
 
Almost 10 years later, part of the solution to one of the most intense real estate -related controversies in Macao is in sight, which involved cases in court, demonstrations and even applications to the Legislative Assembly. Pearl Horizon's injured buyers are about to occupy fractions in buildings built on the same terrain, this time under the aegis of Macau Urban Renewal (MRU).
The public capital company announced that the housing project to exchange in the P Lot P of the new landfills of the sand called Pearl Metropolitan, completed the inspection and licensing phase for use. According to MRU, the next step will be to advance with the delivery procedures of houses to buyers.

To achieve this model, Chan defends the organization of more light shows, artistic facilities and restoration and outdoor beverages.
For its part, the vice president of the North Zone Industrial and Commercial Association of Macao, Lei Chong In, considered that the activity “Flora Fête With Sanrio Characters” in the North Zone can attract more tourists to the residential neighborhoods.
However, Law Chong in suggested that these types of projects using copyright linked to cartoons or famous toys should be carried out as a carnival form, with the launch of exclusive products, food and games, involving local commerce and promote greater consumption.</description><pubDate>2025-07-10 00:12:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Retail | SASA's business rises 7.7% due to increased tourism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/10/retalho-negocios-da-sasa-sobem-77-devido-ao-aumento-do-turismo/</link><description>The Cosmetics retail company SASA registered in the second quarter of this year an annual rise in the turnover of stores in Macau and Hong Kong of 7.7 percent, to a total of $ 687.4 million from Hong Kong.

Franky Fong suggests the elimination of notarial rates and taxes on real estate transactions
 
The president of the Macao Real Estate Real Estate Agents Association (official name), Franky Fong, is not satisfied with how the government has dealt with the sector crisis. Speaking to the newspaper or Mun, the representative lamented that, despite the "excellent results" of the game industry and the increase in the volume of tourists, "the government has ignored the real estate sector, which is in a dying state, as well as the owners affected by the devaluation of real estate, which made them poorest."
From the perspective of the leader and businessman in the field, the government could take several measures to reverse the situation. To begin with, the SAM Hou Fai Executive could change the law that regulates the real estate mediation activity, updating or eliminating excessive penalties and costly regulations. Franky Fong argues that the law should have a penalty mechanism that applies fines and other penalties according to the severity of the offenses, so that agents have more opportunities to correct light failures.
Make way
Another way to stimulate the real estate sector, may undergo tax reduction, such as seal on the transmission of property and building contribution, and the weight of expenses, such as notarial charges, associated with the purchase and sale of real estate.
Franky Fong does not agree that notarial charges are calculated according to the value of the property transaction, instead of having a fixed fee, as it turns out in Hong Kong where notarial and registration costs can range from a few hundred Hong Kong dollars, he said.
Regarding fiscal policy, the official argues that only fractions inhabited under the lease agreement are subject to the collection of a building contribution.
On the other hand, the associative leader advocates the facilitation of bank loans for home purchase, namely by reducing the entrance ratio, or through credit plans with bonuses.
Currently, the maximum mortgage loan ratio is 70 percent and the amount of 30 percent of the house price. Franky Fong points out that both in Hong Kong and the interior of China, flexibility measures have been applied that allow the acquisition of housing without such a high capital entrance.
For the associative leader, the return of the Macao residence setting policy by investment would be another measure of capacity to inject new energy and capital in the market and the local economy.</description><pubDate>2025-07-10 00:09:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourists | 20 million mark hit a month before</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/turistas-marca-dos-20-milhoes-atingida-um-mes-antes/</link><description>More than 20 million tourists have visited Macau since the beginning of the year.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails about sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification as to their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a bastard touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed.

Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstandings, if they are fortunately fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered a war, the best animals will be beheaded. superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

The announcement comes on the day of starting the Han Kuang military exercises, which simulate a response to a possible invasion of China and which, this year, take place over ten days, involving 22,000 reservists, in the largest and longer military exercise performed by the island.
Despite sanctions, the target companies have ensured that the impact on their operations will be limited, as most supply chains do not depend on mainland China.</description><pubDate>2025-07-10 00:39:57</pubDate></item><item><title>EU | China rejects interference in the relationship with Russia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/10/ue-china-rejeita-interferencias-na-relacao-com-a-russia/</link><description>The Chinese government yesterday rejected interference with its relations with Russia, after the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, appealed to Beijing to end his “unshakable support” to Moscow in the war against Ukraine.
"Normal cooperation between China and Russia does not admit interference from third parties," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said at a press conference. Mao assured that the ties between Beijing and Moscow "are not directed against any third part."
The statements arise in response to criticism from von der Leyen, who said the day before, during a debate in the European parliament, that "the unshakable support of China to Russia is creating great instability and insecurity for Europe."
"We can say that, in practice, China is allowing Russia's war economy - and this is not acceptable," said the leader of the community executive, stressing that the way Beijing continues to interact with the Vladimir Putin war will be determining for the future of relations between the European Union (EU) and China.

According to the Provincial Department of Natural Resources, the deposit was located in the Jijiaoshan Minas Gerais zone, in the municipality of Linwu, in the central province of Hunan, and contains approximately 1.31 million tons of lithium oxide, as well as rubidio, tungsten and tin.
The discovery resulted from years of prospecting and the application of new geological exploration technologies, said the Hunan Mineral Resources Measurement Institute, quoted by the Chinese Official News Agency Xinhua.
According to Xu Yiming, a professor at the Institute, the resources found should support the development of the new energy industry in the city of Chenzhou, also located in Hunan.
According to data from the Chinese Ministry of Natural Resources, China recently exceeded the United States and became the second country in the world with the largest identified lithium reserves behind Bolivia, with an increase of 16.5 percent compared to 2024.
The discovery occurs at a time when China intensifies efforts to explore domestic resources, with the aim of reinforcing energy security and access to strategic raw materials, in a context of growing global mineral competition such as lithium, crucial for the production of batteries used in electric vehicles.</description><pubDate>2025-07-10 00:26:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Red Sea | China denies having pointed to laser the German plane</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/10/mar-vermelho-china-nega-ter-apontado-laser-a-aviao-alemao/</link><description>China yesterday refused Berlin's accusation that he pointed to a laser to a German plane in the Red Sea, considering these allegations "completely incompatible with the facts."
"Both parties should adopt a pragmatic attitude, reinforce communication in a timely manner and avoid misunderstandings and calculation errors," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
Germany said on Tuesday that an airplane plane was shot on July 2 by a Chinese laser in the Red Sea. China's ambassador to Berlin was summoned by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The plane was participating in Operation Aspides from the European Union to protect maritime traffic against the attacks of the Houthis rebels in Yemen. The German plane was targeted by the laser “for no reason or prior contact” by a Chinese war ship during a routine surveillance flight, according to a German Ministry of Defense spokesman.
Using the laser, the Chinese ship “risked people and equipment in danger,” he added, without specifying the nature of the used laser.

The data surprised the analysts, who predicted a new price contraction, after a 0.1 percent drop in May.
According to Dong Lijuan, statistical of the National Statistics Office, the measures adopted by the government to stimulate internal demand and encourage consumption “continued to have an effect” in June.
The second largest world economy remains under deflationary pressure due to the combination of poor internal demand and excessive industrial capacity, aggravated by trade war with the United States, which has hindered the flow of inventories accumulated by companies.
Deflation (annual drop in consumer prices) reflects weakness in domestic consumption and investment and is particularly severe, as a drop in assets, as a rule contracted with credit, generates an imbalance between the value of bank loans and guarantees.
Pathway
Chinese authorities have reiterated that reinforcement of internal demand will be one of the central economic priorities for 2025.
The same source also released the price index in the producer, which measures the prices to exit the factory, and which accentuated the 3.3 percent drop in May to 3.6 percent in June, the lowest value since July 2023. The descent was higher than market forecasts, which pointed to a lower contraction.
Dong Lijuan warned that some export -oriented industries are “under pressure” in terms of price and “uncertainty in global trade has affected the expectations of exporting companies”.
In May, Beijing and Washington agreed a temporary 90-day pact, for which China would reduce 125 percent US products from US products to 10 percent, while the US would decrease its 145 percent Chinese goods rates to 30 percent.</description><pubDate>2025-07-10 00:22:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Red Sea | Germany accuses China of pointing out laser to the military plane</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/09/mar-vermelho-alemanha-acusa-china-de-apontar-laser-a-aviao-militar/</link><description>The German government yesterday accused China of having pointed to a laser to a German military plane on a mission in the Red Sea to protect maritime traffic against Huthis attacks, adding to the Chinese ambassador.

According to the forecasts, Danas will pass through southern Zhejiang and then move through the neighboring provinces of Fujian and Jiangxi, throughout this Wednesday, gradually reducing their speed of the current 75 kilometers per hour (km/h) to 35 km/h.
In addition to the strong winds, the Chinese authorities warned that some of the zones where the typhoon will pass may receive rainfall of up to 350 millimeters. This may result, according to China's meteorological administration, in flooding in mountainous and urban areas or in small and medium rivers to extravate the beds.

“Predictability and confidence,” said Ursula Von Der Leyen during a debate on the relations between the European Union (EU) and China at the European Parliament Plenary (PE) in Strasbourg, France.
The president of the community executive anticipated the summit between the political-economic bloc and a country that in five decades is no longer "a country of agriculture and today is an industrial colossus," and "one of the greatest global powers."
Last week, Ursula Von Der Leyen met China's Foreign Minister in Brussels (Belgium), a city that houses the EU's main institutions, including the European Commission.
"We are two of the three largest economies and powers in the world […], but we only exchanged about two billion euros a day [with China]. Although the market is huge, our access is limited," he said.

Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that to realize the will already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages ​​in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary general has ensured that he had “pleasing to work with all parties,” but stressed that this is a “decision that is up to central governments to make” and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, is not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new fund's new direction "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, if by case the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibility of rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish-speaking institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo.

Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything that someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the appropriate place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macao, Camões has been poorly used in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is it for them to be denied this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>FIA | Conference helped perceive future of motorsport</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/13/fia-conferencia-ajudou-a-perceber-futuro-do-automobilismo/</link><description>For the first time in its history, in 2025, Macau welcomed the Extraordinary General Assemblies and Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). Organized in partnership with the Macau-China General Association (AAMC), the FIA-affiliated sports territory, and Galaxy Entertainment Group, this event brought together more than five dozen FIA senior delegates from 147 countries in the field.
 
In the Galaxy International Convention Center, to this day, the future of motoring and mobility worldwide is discussed. However, some details about the future of sport in the territory have already been revealed between the lines. Focused on obtaining information about the growth of motorsport and promoting safe, sustainable and accessible mobility to everyone in the Asia Pacific region, the FIA ​​conference opening session highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration, as well as the region's ability to innovate and create solutions that respond to specific questions it faces.
Roberto Carlos Osório, president of the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), said the association has a strong tradition in motor racing and that following FIA's guidelines is being able to grow rapidly competition at the base level in the region.
“We organized the first GT Macau Cup in 2008,” said the AAMC leader. "Currently, we also have the GT Cup - Great Bay Race for GT4 cars. In addition, in 2008, we created Road Sport Challenge," he explained. “And today, in 2025, we are proud to announce that we have 68 tourism cars in the region to compete in the qualification race to enter the 72nd Macao Grand Prix.”
In a year when AAMC celebrates 30 years of existence - it was born as Macao Automobile Club - we also learned that the association's bet for the future will be in the basic disciplines of motor sport. Roberto Carlos Osorio also revealed a curious fact: Macau has 135 pilots with sports license from the territory.
“This growth was achieved following FIA's guidelines to promote grassroots motorsport and create accessible races for riders in the region,” added the manager of the territory. “With the interest of pilots, teams and promoters in developing state-of-the-art activities in Macau, we will focus even more on base competitions and affordable races, not only to support tourism, but also to make Macau in a Karting international center of international events, where champions can be selected for F4 and, later, for regional formula.”
Confirmed GP program
The Macao Grand Prix Organizing Committee (COGPM) held a press conference on June 8 at the Macao Grand Prix Museum to confirm the 72nd Macao Grand Program races, which will take place from November 13 to 16 this year.
As last year, there will be seven races in total, respectively, the Macao Grand Prix - FR da Fia World Cup, the GT Macau Cup - GT da Fia World Cup, the Macau Guide Race - Kumho Fia tcr World Tour Event of Macau, the Formula 4 Formula 4 World Cup, the 57th Macao Motor Motor Prize, GT Cup - Great Bay Race (GT4) and Macao Roadsport Challenge. For the first time, the guide circuit receives four different cups under the FIA ​​seal on the same weekend.
Other news
Between meetings and communications, other information was revealed about the November edition of the Macao Grand Prix. The FIA ​​World Council approved in Macao that the winner of the first Formula 4 World Cup of the FIA ​​will receive two points for the super license. We have also noticed that Pirelli will equip all the monologes that participate in both the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup and the FIA ​​regional formula World Formula Cup. In turn, the supply of tires and fuel to the FIA ​​GT World Cup remains in the contest phase.
Registration for the Formula 4 World Cup will be open until July 30. The final selection of 20 pilots will be confirmed by the FIA ​​through an official invitation letter, taking into account the current classification of the pilots in the respective championships.
In the case of the FIA ​​Regional Formula World Cup, registrations will also remain open until July 30, and the grill will be able to host a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula -equipped with alpha Romeo engines built by the autotechnic. As with Formula 4, participation will be by invitation, with priority assigned to pilots who have reached the best positions in the five regional formula championships of 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-13 18:43:57</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Jaguar that won in Macau in 1984 returned to the tracks</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/06/gp-jaguar-que-venceu-em-macau-em-1984-regressou-as-pistas/</link><description>The more than seventy years of history of the Macau Grand Prix are people, machines and great moments. We were in 1984, when Tom Walkinshaw won Jaguar's only victory in the guide race. After years away from the audience, for the affected man, this same car returned to the tracks at the hands of an enthusiast of the MSAR MOTOR EVENT
 
Richard Meins, an English maritime transport entrepreneur who lived many years in Hong Kong, who participated on several occasions at the Macao Grand Prix, led this Jaguar XJs of Group A in the Historic Touring Car Challenge race, a competition for classics during the Donington Historic Festival. This “Big Cat”, Chassis No. 5 and one of the four original XJs still existing, is practically as it was in 1984, but given the limitations of tobacco advertising, today boasts the colors used in the European Tourism Championship, instead of the iconic black and gold decoration of John Player Special (JPS) that marked the ticket through the guide circuit.
Interestingly, this return to the clues, from a car that has been still in New Zealand and Japan, was scheduled for the Algarve International Race Track, but the Historic Touring Car Challenge canceled its race in early April in Portimão. So it was in lands of his majesty that Richard Meins made his first race with the British car.
“The car won in Macao in 1984, so I'm a big fan of this model,” Ricard Meins told the English magazine Motorsport News. “I still have the photographs I took this weekend in Macao,” recalled this avid classic competition car collector who, besides driving, supported several riders at the Macao Grand Prix.
In Donington Park, Richard Meins shared the imposing Jaguar XJS, equipped with a 5.3 -liter V12 engine with Jack Tetley, and ended in sixth place, winning in his class. Richard Meins had only guided the car once or twice, but plans to participate in more historic touring car challenge rounds with XJS 1984. “Let's try to put it on track more often now,” Ricard Meins said, who revealed that he was a stake in the Silverstone Festival in August with this very rare and striking copy of the 1980s tourism cars history.
Premiere of an iconic decoration
In the summer of 1984, Tom Walkinshaw accepted the challenge of the Portuguese organization of the Grand Prix to travel later this year to Macau. With the European title in his pocket, the English driver and team boss was accompanied by one of his usual riders, German Hans Heyer. The guide race was a BMW fiefdom and the controversial English wanted to put an end to the Bavarian domain in the race. To this end, it had the precious support of JPS, which was relaunching the brand, decorating its cars with the famous black and gold colors that would later be eternalized in Ayrton Senna's Lotus. At the time, the guide race took place three weeks before 1000 km from Bathurst, another important race on the worldwide calendar of tourist racing, and so TWR made a "two in one."
The 100 -mile race on the streets of Macao would not have much history, such as the cars built in the Kidlington workshops against the competition headed by the two BMW 635i Schnitzer officers, guided by Hans Stuck and Dieter Quester, and painted by rival Marlboro. Tom Walkinshaw ended first and Hans Heyer and m second.
At the end of the race, quoted by the Portuguese newspaper Autosport, Tom Walkinshaw said: “The circuit is fantastic. Tight, but with many curves, climbs and descents, which made the race become difficult. But I like difficult things and, for me, the race was great from beginning to end.
The Jaguar were again invited by the Macao Grand Prix committee to run in 1985, but Tom Walkinshaw had other plans for his cars. Fortunately, thanks to Richard Meins we will continue to see this beautiful car on the tracks.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>TCR China | André Couto participated in the Zhejiang race</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/tcr-china-andre-couto-participou-na-prova-de-zhejiang/</link><description>Over the weekend, André Couto had an unexpected return to the TCR China Championship, in what was his first race of this season. The rider of the sgas showed that "who knows, never forgets", despite having had a troubled passage through the Zhejiang International Circuit
The Portuguese pilot residing in Macao, who has not competed since November last year-when he played the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals, having won the title in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia Pro-AM category-received a last-minute invitation from MacPro Racing Team to conduct one of the Honda Civic Fl5 TCR Team in the third race of the Chinese Championship. TCR.
Without any prior training, André Couto came back to sit in a car he already knew, also with a technical structure that was familiar to him. By 2023, the territory pilot had already played some TCR China events with this set, then at the service of the official team Dongfeng Honda Racing Team, showing a progress right from the beginning.
"Free training did not go wrong, but in qualification a less attentive pilot hit me on my first departure lap to the track. He hit me from behind and did not realize why. Damaged me the rear, dislocated the convergence and the car was crooked. Hm. "Still, I qualified myself in fourth in Q1, five tenths of the first, which, with the car in the conditions it was, was not bad. The car had potential."
In Q2, due to the damage, the Japanese car “became much harder to guide” and Couto ended in tenth. However, this ended up having a positive effect: “With the reversal of the starting grid, the tenth place of Q2 allowed me to start first to the second race.”
The first race, played on Saturday on the shaoxing track, did not go as well as the pilot wanted, not being able to follow the official links, nor the best Honda and Hyundai. "I ended up eighth. The car was not as good as I expected and we found that there was a damaged damper, still from the crash in the qualification, which was exchanged for the Sunday race."
Inglorius Sunday
In the 20 Sunday round race, André Couto had everything to shine as he departed from pole-position and Honda finally seemed in a position to fight for the first places. "On the way back, the car was good. I didn't feel strange anymore and I was optimistic."
The idea was to get well to distance themselves from the fastest competitors in the first laps and then manage the race with new tires. However, it all faded quickly when it was wrapped by Wu Yi Fan right in the brake for the first curve.
“That was my mission, but I couldn't,” acknowledged the winner of the 2000 Macao Grand Prix. “He hit me on the first curve and the car was damaged. Sports commissioners, but that does not change the fact that I have given up. ”
With Honda's damaged direction, André Couto had no choice but to leave. "I was a bit disappointed because I hope to get a good result for MacPro Racing Team that had given me a good car.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:26:00</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA AFINA REGIONAL Formula Rules</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/gp-fia-afina-regras-da-formula-regional/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) took advantage of the holding of the Extraordinary General Assemblies and its annual conference to publish the Macao Grand Prix Regulation - FIA Regional Formula Cup of 2025. There are not many changes compared to 2024, but the changes introduced aim to browse gaps from the first edition of this competition in Macau
The twelve red flags during last year's qualification session called for the level of pilots at the Guide Circuit, which was the premiere of the FIA ​​regional formula in Macau regional formula. This happened after the controversial decision of the FIA ​​to consider that Formula 3 was no longer adequate to the Macao Citadino layout.
Unsurprisingly, the sports regulation is now clear that, to compete in the FIA ​​regional formula world, “all pilots must have participated at least 3 competitions with a monolugar that has been projected and/or built to achieve a weight/power ratio of more than 3.0 kg/hp.”
Emanuele Pirro, a former F1 pilot, winner of the Guide Race and president of the FIA ​​monoligai committee, said during the weekend of the 71st edition that, in the future, the FIA ​​will be more demanding about track discipline. Thus, from now on, “any pilot who, in the opinion of sports commissioners, is solely responsible for the display of a red flag during the qualification training session, will not be able to continue to participate in this session and its best time back can be annulled.” The new regulation also states that “if a qualification training session is interrupted with less than four minutes remaining, it will not be restarted.”
On the other hand, the FIA ​​maintains the limit in the participation of more experienced pilots, except only “pilots who participated in a maximum of 3 FI F2 Championship competitions of 2025.” This measure goes a little against the spirit and history of the Great Prize, which has always gathered pilots from higher categories in its main race. In fact, this was a fervent question between Macao and the International Federation on two previous occasions.
In 1985, Alfredo César Torres, then responsible for Portuguese motorsport, convinced Jean-Marie Balestre, against his will, to allow the participation of F1 pilots in the F3 Intercontinental Cup in the name of the economic viability of the race. In 2016, the controversy returned with the veto da FIA to the participation of Nelsinho Piquet, a decision badly received by the teams and then coordinator Barry Bland, which would eventually abandon the co-organization of the race a year later.
Bet on continuity
In sports terms, registrations for this second edition of the FIA ​​regional formula Cup will remain open until July 30. The grill may include a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula monologues, all equipped with Alfa Romeo engines built by the Italian Autotechnic. Pirelli will once again be the official tire supplier.
The identities of the invited teams have not yet been revealed, but some news is expected in this field compared to 2024. To avoid any behind -the -scenes disputes, it has already been defined that “the position on the boxes for the teams that participate in the Macao Grand Prix will be based on the ranking of the previous year” and, in turn, “the position in the roadway for new teams will be attributed based on the order of application.”
Equal awards and more restricted advertising
The values ​​of monetary awards remain unchanged this year, with a total of US $ 68,500 to distribute, the equivalent of just over 550,000 patacas at the current exchange rate. The race winner will receive $ 12,000, an amount that is still far from covering the costs of participation in this nature.
On the other hand, the sports regulation introduces two new prohibitions on advertising into the monoligales. In addition to the existing prohibition of advertising to fortune or bad luck, tobacco or pornography, also the promotion of electronic cigarettes and alcoholic beverages - a measure that follows the legislation in force in the territory.
The 72nd Macao Grand Prix, the largest international sports event of the MSA, will take place between November 13 and 16, 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-06-23 03:31:16</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Project for new track in Zhuhai emerges</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/automobilismo-surge-projecto-para-nova-pista-em-zhuhai/</link><description>With a very black cloud to turn to the future of the Zhuhai International Circuit, there is a potential good news for the great bay of motoring: a project for a new permanent circuit in the Chinese city adjacent to the MSAR.
According to Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper, Guangdong's provincial government recently published the document “Measures to promote high quality tourism and accelerate the construction of a strong tourist province”, which proposes, for the first time, the creation of an “industrial circle of culture and tourism of the Great Bay”, offering political support to the integrated development of culture and tourism in the region. With this, the first industrial and tourist complex of motorized sports in the Great Bay may emerge.
The project of the Zhuhai Chaoyue international circuit was recently presented at the Zhuhai Ocean Spring Resort, located in Doumen, not far from the city's airport, with an initial investment of 250 million Renminbis.
According to the first information, the project of this circuit provides for welcoming evidence such as Formula 3 and foster collaborative development between motorized sports sectors, cultural events and exhibition industry. The plan includes the holding of several international tests per year and foresees collaboration with Hong Kong and Macau to connect cities such as Jiangmen and Zhongshan, promoting “Multiple stops” and boosting the innovative development of “Event Economics + Cultural Tourism”.
According to Zhou Jian, China Travel Service (Zhuhai) Executive Director General Ocean Spring Resort Co., the FIA ​​grade certification-will also include a karting track, drift track and an interior space of 2,400 m² for exhibitions and events related to the automobile sector. With more than 50 international events projected annually, the goal is to become a "super IP" that joins running, leisure and tourism under the same concept.
The first phase of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit project will include international certification professionals, as well as support facilities. This project aims not only to fill “a gap in the high -end motorized sports sector in Zhuhai, but will also promote the modernization of the Great Bay's cultural, sports and tourist industries by conducting international racing and themed cultural events linked to motorsport.”
Uncertainties in the air
Last summer, the company Malay LBS Bina Group BHD announced that it sold its participation in the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) - the first permanent circuit built in the interior of China - by 124.7 million ringits (about 214.15 million patacas). In a statement to Bursa Malaysia Securities BHD, the group reported that their subsidiary, Dragon Hill Corporation Ltd, sold all his participation in Lamdeal Investments Ltd (Lil) to Huafa Urban Operation (HK) Ltd, a well -known real estate operator. Lil Detinha 60 percent of Zhuhai International Circuit Limited (ZICL), circuit operator.
Raised in 1996 in order to receive the first major award from China from Formula 1 - something that never materialized - ZIC was still the initial motor of motoring in the country and a reference in Asian motorsport. Since its opening, it has welcomed several international evidence, such as the FIA ​​GT, A1 GP or the Intercontinental Le Mans Series. In recent years, track administration has chosen to organize its own events, abdicating the most costly international evidence.
Despite having received, in the past, auto competitions from MSAR, ZIC has been losing protagonism in local motorized sport, due to high prices, limited availability and reducing sports activity in favor of the most profitable commercial activities. The future of the circuit remains uncertain: it is only known that lease agreements between resident teams and the circuit have been frozen and are not being renewed. The track approval will also be about to expire, requiring a new certification to continue to receive competitions in the future.
However, on the weekend of June 14 and 15, the still only circuit of Zhuhai will host the third race of the Formula 4 China Championship season.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 01:53:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao's historicals get a GP clearance</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/historicos-de-macau-conseguem-apuramento-para-gp/</link><description>The Guangdong International Circuit welcomed, last weekend, the second and decisive double journey of Macao - Macau Road Sport Challenge cars, proof of finding for the most important motor racing of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. In a journey with few celebration reasons for the colors of the sinters, the veterans Jerónimo Badaraco and Rui Valente managed to ensure the qualification.
With a list of 68 subscribers, the grill was divided into two groups, A and B, with all the pilots competing with Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8) models. This year, with only one race scheduled for the Grand Prix Program - due to the inclusion of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup - the number of riders was reduced to 36, which placed a supplementary pressure for both missing races. To complicate, the rain came, changing the turns to teams and riders.
In Group A, where Rui Valente faced a complicated weekend on the track around Zhaoqing, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão failed to qualify, in a series dominated by Hong Kong pilots. In Saturday's race, the podium consisted of Wong Chuck Pan, Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping. On Sunday, these three repeated the feat, but with a new order: Lo Pak Yu, Chan Ka Ping and Wong Chuck Pan.
In difficult atmospheric conditions on Saturday, Rui Valente ended only 25th, due to an error in tuning, improving to 15th on Sunday, with the track dry. A penalty after the second race fired him to the 27th place. Still, the 7th place obtained on the first round was enough to secure a place in the Macao Grand Prix.
On the contrary, Maximiano Mannão, behind the wheel of a Toyota with the colors of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended on 26th and 14th, a result below the finding, but it turns out to be positive given that it was Jove Pilot's debut in these wanderings. Célio Alves Dias, with difficulties in his car since the first race, was 24th and 28th, far from the usual level of this experienced Macaense pilot.
Badaraco with final sprint '
On a weekend, where the lively races were broadcast on live streaming in Group B, Hong Kong riders stood out again. On Sunday, Adrian Chung won, with Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin completing the podium. In the second confrontation, Cheang Kin Sang reached a deserved victory, followed again by Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin.
Jerónimo Badaraco came to this challenging weekend without the assured clearance. A modest qualification and 11th Saturday place maintained the open outcome. However, a solid race on Sunday and an excellent 4th place assured veteran Macaense the much desired place on the grid of the Macau Grand Prix, along with countrymen Cheng Kin San, Leong Keng Hei, Lou Check In and Carson Tang.
Also outside the Grand Prix was Dionísio Albino Pereira, who finished 23rd in Saturday's race, but closed the time more forcefully, cutting the line of goal in 13th place in the second race.
At the end of the races, competitors provisionally calculated had an extra technical verification, being forced to open engines and gearbox, to verify the legality of these two decisive organs of their vehicles.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:57:43</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
