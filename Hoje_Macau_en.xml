This vote, whose result still needs to be confirmed by the National Electoral Commission, should allow South Korea to recover a leader and political stability, after six months of crisis triggered by the previous head of state, Yoon Suk Yeol.

At the time, enough deputies managed to meet to vote for a motion and quickly fail the initiative of the then president, which was classified as a stroke.
Six months followed in deep political chaos, among massive demonstrations, arrest and dismissal of Yoon Suk Yeol, an unprecedented succession of Interinian presidents and other twists, namely judicial.

It is the first time since 2020 that these subsidies are updated
 
From September, subsidies attributed to schools with recurring education classes will all be increased by 3 percent. The information was released yesterday through the official bulletin, in the one that is the first increase in this support since 2020, during the pandemic period.
According to the increases decided by the Chief Executive, the allowance attributed to each class of primary education will rise from 899,600 patacas to 926,600 patacas, a difference of 27 thousand patacas.
Regarding general secondary school classes, the value will grow from 1,073,800 patacas to 1,106,000 patacas, an increase of 32,200 patacas. Finally, in complementary secondary education the subsidy will rise from 1,210,600 patacas to 1,246,900 patacas, a difference of 36,300 patacas.
Data from the management of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) in relation to the number of classes are related to the school year 2023/2024 and indicate that this year there were a total of 56 recurring education classes. Among these, three classes were of primary education, while the remaining 53 were fitting in secondary education, although it is not possible to distinguish between general or complementary classes.
Given these data, the updating of subsidies would have an extra cost of primary education of 81,000 patacas, from 2,698,800 patacas to 2,779,800 patacas. As for the 53 classes of secondary education, and assuming that all classes are of general education, since it is the smaller value, the update of the allowance will have an extra cost of at least 1.71 million patacas, from 56,911,400 patacas for 58,911,400 patacas.
Cost of 1.79 million
Based on the calculations presented, the measure will thus have an extra total cost, considering primary and secondary education of 1.79 million patacas.
According to DSEDJ statistics, in the school year 2024/2025, when the increases were not yet in force, there were five schools to make recurring classes in the territory at different levels: Luso-Chinese official elementary school, Luso-Chinese high school of Luíz Gonzaga Gomes, Millennium School Secondary School Xin Hua, Seong Fan School of the Macao Commercial Association and São João de Brito School. These schools were attended by 976 students, an increase of 10 students compared to the school year 2023/2024.
Applicant education is intended for people who for some reason have not completed their studies and are outside the “normal age of regular education”.

Without confirming if it will be a list head, Ron Lam said he wants to continue to be a bridge between the government and the population. About his first term, Ron Lam confessed to feeling powerless, despite the effort to demonstrate his opinions
 
The Macau Synergy Association yesterday handed over to the Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) the request for the constitution of the Candidacy Commission for Legislative Elections. The Association led by President Johnson Ian and Vice-President and Deputy Ron Lam also handed over about four hundreds of signatures to support the candidacy.
Despite confessing that I would like to continue to give voice to the population, for the association of Macau synergy, it does not have a list formed, a fact that Ron Lam justified with limited resources and lack of time. "Regarding who will be the head of the list, our team will still argue, but I believe there are those who want me to keep my place in Hemiciclo. But it is important to obey the team's decision," he said.
Regarding his first term of deputy, who is about to end, Ron Lam confessed some frustration between commitment, his expectations and how they were not reflected in political reality. "I applied myself to legislative work with effort, participated in all meetings and expressed my opinions, but the results did not correspond to what I expected," he said.
To the other bank
Speaking in the public administration building, Ron Lam defended the importance of making the government the different opinions of the population, the mission that the deputy and potential candidate admits to want to continue to perform.
In fact, public opinion perceived by the deputy and the suggestions that result from public consultations of the executive continue to present major discrepancies. Ron Lam argues that these differences make governance not correspond to the wishes and expectations of the population for social development.
"We hope to continue effectively the role of bridge between society and the government, reflecting the opinions of the population. We also hope that the executive will decide more political, seriously and humble, in accordance with popular will," said Ron Lam.
The deputy gave as an example of situations in which the executive turned back after public opinions, which gave voice, the suspension of the works that would erect a giant statue of the goddess Kun iam in Coloane. "Although we can often not do better, in others we get the authorities to follow the way we point out."
The same was not true of changes to the form of attribution of the pecuniary check, where Ron Lam claims to have lacking communication between the government and society, not even through public consultation.

For unraveling was the taboo about the position of Rita Santos on the list
 
The new hope list of Deputy José Pereira Coutinho, linked to the Macao Public Function Workers Association (ATFPM), delivered yesterday the request for recognition of the candidacy committee with 500 signatures. However, this is not yet the case that the taboo was broken over the position of Rita Santos on the list that should participate in the suffrage of September 14.
"I'm on the list, but I have to respect my colleagues, who are here. We are still ultimately the chaining of the list, because the goal, as I said, is having a voice from the list of new hopes and a very satisfactory result," said José Pereira Coutinho. "She [Rita Santos] will be on the list. Now how she will be is that I still have to talk to my colleagues, but it will be," he said.
Before delivering the request for recognition of the application committee, and although several lists of a more critical spectrum of the government were disqualified in 2021, Coutinho considered that these will be the most difficult elections of recent years: "No, it is not bluff, it is really difficult because there will be more lists, and the lists are strong," he said. "Nowadays, those traditional lists have a very important weight because they have a great financial capacity that can move buildings. And I don't say moving boats or cars, they are the same, with their foundations, which can be moved within two weeks," he said. "The list will have a very close fight, but I hope people are aware that vote is a very important act," he added.
Unintended
Until June 6, the lists have to deliver the request for recognition of the application committee. After this process, if everything is in accordance with applicable legislation, the Legislative Assembly Electoral Affairs Committee (Caeal) recognizes the application committee and lists may present its candidates.
The names of the candidates are then subjected to a political process, led by the State Security Defense Commission, chaired by the Chief Executive, and in which representatives of the interior, such as advisers, have the power to veto the names presented. The decision is final and does not allow judicial appeal.
However, yesterday, José Pereira Coutinho devalued the possibility of being disqualified, despite recognizing being critical of the government. "Oh no, I don't think I will be disqualified]. The fact that being critical does not mean that I am not a patriot, I am also a patriot, so that we have always worked for the good of Macao and for the good of the citizens of Macao," he said. “Confident!” He concluded.
Greater transparency
Regarding the competition of other lists, Coutinho defended the need for the authorities to ensure that the elections will take place with transparency, not only to ensure that the results are fair, but also not to be transmitted a bad example for young people in Macao.
The deputy also criticized the attitude of various associations, not to mention names, who accused that they have taken advantage of helping the government to distribute to the elderly the card under the consumer carnival to collect signatures for the candidacy commissions. According to Pereira Coutinho, several seniors declared support for other candidacy committees, without being aware of what they were doing, when they intended to support the new hope. In 2021 the New Hope list was the third most voted force, with a total of 18,323 votes.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:33:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Budget 2025 | Government removes 12 billion from the estimates of the game's revenues</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/orcamento-2025-governo-retira-12-mil-milhoes-as-estimativas-das-receitas-do-jogo/</link><description>The advanced forecast in November by the executive, which pointed to 240 billion casinos gross revenues in 2025, was reviewed. The government now predicts that revenues have a break of 12 billion patacas, forcing the budgetary review yesterday by André Cheong yesterday
 
Yesterday were released by the Executive Council, the data on the budget review for this year, which happens due to the low forecast of the amount of gross revenues of the game, which depend, on large scale, the local economy and public revenues.
Thus, if the executive initially estimated that the game's gross gross revenues would be, this year, from 240 billion patacas, this value now drops to 228 billion, or 12 billion. Regarding the average monthly estimate, 19 billion patacas in gross revenues are now foreseen, because "the situation is not like the one planned."
In yesterday's presentation, the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, and also spokesman for the Executive Board, said that “after study and analysis of the current global economic conjuncture and the effective situation of exploitation of the game sector from the beginning of this year to the present moment, it is proposed that the annual estimate of gross revenues of the game will be reduced from 240 billion to 228 billion, thus serving as to Main base of the financial budget financial revenues, and that relevant budgetary revenue rules are properly adjusted. ”
In November last year, when Ho Iat Seng was about to leave the position of Chief Executive, predictions for gross revenues were 240 billion, taking into account the initial version of the budget proposal for 2025. At the time, the forecast represented an increase compared to what had been estimated to 2024, which situated the gross revenues of casinos by 216 billion Patacas, an increase of 11.1 percent. Given the gross game recipes in 2023, the estimate for 2025 was a 31.1 percent increase.
It is important to highlight that the new forecast below expected is an annual increase of only 0.5 percent in gross revenues, when the initial numbers translated into annual growth of 5.8 percent. In the first five months of this year, the game's revenues rose only 1.7 percent annually to 97.7 billion patacas.
Balance Guarantee
In response to journalists, the subdirector of finance services, Ho Silvestre in Mare, said the new calculations were based on the data provided by the Directorate of Inspection and Game Coordination Services (DICJ) in contrast to the first semester public expenses.
“In this proposed budget law we made an analysis of the global conjuncture and took into account a different model regarding the consumption of tourists in Macau. We made general considerations for these estimates and, according to DICJ, from January to April this year, an average of 19 billion and there was an increase to 21.1 billion (gross revenues). reaching the 20 billion [ragous game revenues, on average], so in the second half of the year there will be uncertainties. ”
"In this budget we intend to take a balance in expense and revenue. After an evaluation at the first half of the year, we can make an assessment taking into account the amount of 19 billion Patacas, and according to the current expense of the MSAR, we were able to get a more balanced budget," he added.
In general terms, and according to the explanatory note presented by André Cheong, the total amount of the ENGRICIAN INTEGRATED ORDINARY BUDGET for the 2025 economic year is 116.5 billion, when a revenue of the 121 billion patacas was expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to reduce the DSF's gross revenue revenue. The cut is 4.56 billion patacas.
In addition, the official said, only the reduction in the tax raised on the game, due to the break in gross revenues, translates into 450 million patacas for the administration. It should also be noted that budgetary expense within the PIDDA [Administration Development Investment and Development Plan] is reviewed to about 19.587 billion Patacas.
Budgetary expense rises 2.5 percent due to education and social support
The government ensures that, in the proposal for a budget for this year, the construction of a new campus of the University of Macau (one) on Hengqin Island will contribute, in part, to the increase in expense, around 2.5 percent, as well as “the increase in the budget in relation to subsidies attributed to vulnerable groups and investment in research and scientific and technological development”.
In the budget proposal presented yesterday, there is a approximate amount of 1.7 billion Patacas for the construction of the new UM campus, said the subdirect of Finance Services (DSF). In addition, at the level of scientific and technological investment was added the amount of 340 million patacas “for investments in the scope of science and technology, such as the acquisition of laboratory devices, to satisfy the measure and policies of the Government of Masters,” said Ho Silvestre in Mais.
"For construction is expected an expense of about eight billion patacas. As the campus is built on Hengqin Island, the cost must be calculated in Renminbis, which is about seven billion. This is the data we can have at this time," said the official.
Support for support
With regard to social support, the budget proposal for this year reveals an increase of 2.86 billion of Patacas in the expected expenses, as a way of reinforcing these supports. In total, the rise in expenses is 2.5 percent, to 116.2 billion patacas.
As for the preparation of the budget for next year, it is being prepared and the watchword is containment. "We are already elaborating the budget for the year 2026, and all services of the Government of MSAR need to consider more about their expenses, especially given the current conjuncture. In the budgetary elaboration phase we take a prudent and rigorous attitude towards the expenses," said the subdirector of DSF.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:29:05</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korea | Left candidate wins presidential</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/coreia-do-sul-candidato-da-esquerda-vence-presidenciais/</link><description>Opposition candidate Lee Jae-Myung (Center left) is given as a winner of the presidential election in South Korea, with 51.7 percent of the votes, according to the projections released after the closing of this vote with a single lap.

The event is part of the poster of the celebrations “June, Portugal's month in the sgas”, regarding the arrival of June 10-Portugal Day, Camões and the Portuguese Communities.
According to the synopsis of the documentary, quoted in a FRC note, "Metamorṗhosis" is "an thought -provoking documentary that explores the transformation of rural communities through social and environmental changes", and "the film follows the stories of three villages whose lives reflect the wider social mutations of modernity, in the scenario of the" villages of schist, in Portugal. "
Moreover, it is added in the same synopsis that "in the course of history is made known a man who has never abandoned the land where he was born." “Seeing the villages condemned to depopulation, he fought with vision and tenacity by the collective emancipation of the villages through the recovery of the cultural traditions that are faded,” can be read in the description.
Deconstructed standards

"We will continue to knock on the European Commission door to lower the threshold for visitors from outside Europe," said the president of the European Confederation of Travel Agency Associations and Tour Operators (ECTAA). Frank Oostdam spoke in Macao at a press conference when asked about the European response to China's visa exemption policy, which since October 15 covers Portugal.
In late March, the Chinese ambassador in Lisbon Zhao Bentang said in an interview with Lusa that "China has already asked Europe, Portugal, that facilitates the entry to Chinese citizens." But the Dutch Frank Oostdam admitted that “the political climate is not encouraging” and that the current trend is for further restrictions on entering the European Union, giving as an example the Netherlands.
Oostdam spoke hours before the leader of the far right of the Netherlands, Geert Wilders, had removed the party from the government coalition, due to disagreement over immigration, paving the way to early elections. Wilders required a radical reduction in migration, reinforcing border controls and rejection of all asylum applicants.
“We would like to have as many people travel the world as much as possible, but I'm not that confident,” said Frank Oostdam. "We are very in favor of freedom of circulation, because if people know each other, we will have a better world," said the president of Ectaa.
In the same tone
Before the press conference, also the president of the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT) lamented “there was no same solution from Europe's point of view regarding Chinese tourists”. “We would really like to happen, this is the opinion of ECTAA, this is the position of APAVT. The visas are harmful to mobility and mobility is good for the world,” defended Pedro Costa Ferreira.
In the case of Portugal, the visa exemption for entry to China is in force until December 31, but Frank Oostdam has shown hope that it will be “prolonged for many years”. "From what we hear, the situation seems optimistic. Hopefully yes, because the visa issue is really essential to explore the potential of tourism from Europe to China," said the leader.
"If we do not have [visa exemption], the potential is there, but it will not result in much more tourists," warned the Dutch. Ectaa vice president, Heli Maki-Franti, lamented that the closing of Russia airspace led the airlines to “dramatically reduce” the number of flights to China.
The European Union closed airspace to Russian aircraft after the invasion of Ukraine, and Moscow retaliated with similar prohibitions, making the links between Asia and Europe more expensive. "Many customers are not willing to pay," said Maki-Fanti.
Macau's Director of Tourism Services (STD), Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, said this represents “a clear opportunity” to Chinese carriers, “because they can fly over Russian territory”. The problem, said Heli Maki-Fanti, is that European travelers "do not yet know Chinese airlines." "There is a lot of [promotion work] that these companies could do in the European market," added the Finnish.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:59:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Broadway | Francis Lui points to possible renewal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/broadway-francis-lui-aponta-para-possivel-renovacao/</link><description>Galaxy president Francis Lui revealed that the group he leads is facing the possibility of renewing the integrated Broadway resort in the future, but for now, the priority remains the construction of the 4th phase of Galaxy Macau, which will have a theme park.
Quoted by the Hong Kong Ming Pao newspaper, the Galaxy leader comments that one of the main challenges that Macau faces is the lack of prices below a thousand patacas per night, reiterating the idea that the market is lacking at least 10,000 rooms for shorter budgets. It is recalled that the group recently opened Capella at Galaxy Macau, which offers 36 luxurious villages.
Francis Lui added that the gap in the market causes the thousands of tourists coming from the interior of China to watch the shows in Macau end up not staying overnight due to the high prices of accommodation, a gap that cannot be collected even with a renewed Broadway that only offers 300 rooms.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:45:28</pubDate></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Guan daosheng (1262-1319), the painter and poet of the Yuan Dynasty, wife of the no less famous painter Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322), even made mural paintings on walls of Buddhist temples but would not be these figures drawn in strong stones that would resist the passage of time but those that made about fragile sheets of paper or silk that,, which,, that Wrapped and tied with a satin ribbon were passed from hand to hand.

"Europe, even because of all the defense of human rights, has to be much more vocal to saying to Israel that it cannot exceed the boundaries it is exceeding, and that current international agreements do not allow certain actions," Elisa Ferreira said in statements to Lusa after a conference at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau.
However, the academic noted that Member States have never attributed competencies to the European Union in defense that allow it, for example, to intervene with armament in cases of country invasions.
"That said, many countries-Ireland, Spain-they moved a lot, and I think there is a joint and joint voice to prevent us with a sense of impotence in the face of deaths that are absolutely unacceptable in the 21st century," said the former Minister of the Environment (1995-1999) and territorial planning (1999-2002) in the governments of António Guterres. Elisa Ferreira stressed that there have already been “there were some expressions of this will” by Lisbon and expects “to keep up”.
PEACE STEPS
In late May, Slovenia, Spain, Ireland and Norway, who recognized the Palestinian state a year ago, appealed to all countries to do the same compared to Palestine and Israel, as it is a necessary step for peace in the region.
"We remember that recognition is another step towards the implementation of the solution of both states and we appeal to the international community to take the necessary steps to make it a reality, among them, the individual recognition of Palestine and Israel by the countries that have not yet done it," reads a "joint statement."
Israel's retaliation for Hamas' attack on October 7 caused more than 54,000 dead, the destruction of almost all Gaza strip infrastructures and the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of people.
Elisa Ferreira wants to look for new partners like China
Former European doctor Elisa Ferreira defended Lusa yesterday that the European Union must rethink partnerships and look for new interlocutors, including Beijing, to keep “a great actor” on the international scenario.
"If there is an opportunity in every crisis, as I think the Chinese say, there is also an opportunity in this US leadership crisis, because it has shown us that Europe has to know where it wants to go and not lose control over its own agenda, and, on the other hand, has to diversify partners abroad," said in Macao, in statements to Lusa, the former Portuguese minister, after a conference at the consulate of Portugal.
In the current context of instability, China “has to be a great partner,” said the academic. "China is a great power. I think it has always been latent, now it is completely affirmed, especially in future areas, in stories of new digital and environmental technologies." "For a long time, Europe wanted to be driving out of new clean energy, energy savings technologies, etc.; I think China, when it defines it, when it determines, when it is organized, accelerates with an unstoppable speed," he noticed.
In Macao at an invitation from the Institute of European Studies, Elisa Ferreira inaugurated yesterday the “conversations in the Consulate” cycle, with the lecture “Portugal: from the successes of the democratic Portugal to the crossroads of the present”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Dsal | Number of work accidents suffers slight breakdown in annual terms</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/03/dsal-numero-de-acidentes-laborais-sofre-quebra-ligeira-em-termos-anuais/</link><description>Data related to occupational accidents last year reveal stability compared to 2023: about five thousand people, 5,095, suffered accidents at work, slightly less than 5,293 victims of 2023, while the number of deadly victims arising from these incidents remained in a dozen

Data released on Friday by the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs (DSAL) show how in the space of one year, between 2023 and 2024, the work accident panorama remained stable, and even a light break in the number of occurrences and the same number of dead.
According to the report related to 2024, a total of 5,095 workers suffered an accident at work, and the main cause was the “fall of people”, which represented the 25.4 percent bar of the total of incidents, followed by the “raising in or between objects”, which represented 19.3 percent of all incidents, and the “march or shock in objects”, with 16.1 percent.
According to the DSAL report released last year, there were 5,293 victims of occupational accidents in 2023, and almost all occurrences (5,253) resulted in temporary work disability. Only 30 cases resulted in the person's permanent disability, and 10 people died. Last year, DSAL also recorded the same number of deaths from occupational accidents, and a case is associated with an alleged “infringement of occupational safety and health legislation”.
"All mortal cases were sent to the court organs for due processing, and, later, DSAL will adjust the data in accordance with the judgments given," reads the report relating to 2024.
DSSA says investigations to all labor incidents, having applied fines to two entities for “infringements to occupational safety and health” in cases involving two workers. In addition, fines to 43 persons were applied for infringement of the legal regime of reparation for emerging damages of occupational accidents and occupational diseases, involving 303 workers in total.
More men than women
The report also presents more specific data on occupational accidents last year. Thus, of the 5,095 cases, 5,063 resulted in temporary disability, and 557 workers managed to return to service on the same day of the occurrence of the accident highlights DSal. However, a total of 22 people ended up having permanent disability. Noteworthy is the number of people who were hit in the hands (1,336), followed by accidents in the feet zone with 894 occurrences, various parts of the body with 831 cases, and accidents in the trunk zone with 743 cases.
Statistical data also show that men dominate with regard to victims: thus, in 2024, 255 victims aged between 16 and 24 years. In this age group, 165 men suffered occupational accidents as opposed to 90 women. The numbers rise in people aged 25 to 44, in which there were 2,719 occurrences, reaching 1,568 men and 1,151 women.
From 45 to 64 there were 1,908 occurrences, this time, more women than men: 1,188 compared to 720 male workers. Highlight for 213 cases of occupational accidents involving people at renovation age, ie 65 years or older, where 120 women were affected in contrast with 93 men.
The 2024 data also look at the type of profession in which more accidents occurred: dominate the “administrative employees”, with 1,318 cases, followed by the “staff of services, sellers and similar work”, with 1,207 cases, as well as “unqualified workers” with 1,219 occurrences. There were also 413 occurrences in the group of “workers of industrial production and artisans” and 196 in “operators of machines, drivers and assemblers”. In the category of “intermediate level technicians and professionals” were registered 420 work incidents.
Let's go by parts
If we look at the numbers of occupational accidents taking into account the branch of economic activity, it is observed that they dominate “cultural and recreational activities, lottery and other services”, therefore, to the game and entertainment sector, with 1,512 cases occurred last year. Following are accidents in “hotels, restaurants and the like”, with 1,293 cases, as well as 414 incidents in the area of ​​“transport, storage and communications”. In the construction sector, there were 374 accidents.
It should be noted that the 2023 data is also similar in terms of economic activity where more work accidents occurred and in terms of the gender of workers, with 52 percent of men and 48 percent of affected women. In 2023, there was a higher incidence of occupational accidents in ages between 25 and 44 years, representing 53.6 percent, while at the age of 45 and 64 years, the percentage of accidents lowered to 37.2 percent.
The 2023 DSal report also showed that “cultural and recreational activities, lottery and other services” (29.5 percent), “hotels, restaurants and the like” (23.2 percent) and “transport, storage and communications” (10.8 percent) occupied the first three positions compared to the total number of occupational accident victims.
Regarding the professions, the “unqualified workers” (26 percent), the “staff of services, sellers and similar workers” (24 percent) and the “administrative employees” (22.9 percent) occupied the first three positions in relation to the total victims of occupational accidents.
Action and reaction
The 2024 DSA DSA report also reveals that 3,550 inspection visits were made to different workplaces, such as construction shipyards, industrial and commercial establishments, which resulted in 395 improvement recommendations and fines in 10 situations due to lack of safety.
Last year, four suspensions of the operation of shipyards were ordered in the context of occupational safety and health verification, the most serious consequence after the application of fines or awareness.
Dsal also points out that, last year, 404 seminars were performed for different sectors and types of work, which had the participation of 17,148 people. Regarding courses on occupational safety and health, formations were carried out to obtain the occupational security card in the construction, with 26,590 participants, which resulted in the issuance of 25,069 cards. The “Safety Training Courses in Specific Construction Works” had 3,167 participants, and 2,895 certificates were issued.
In another important area for the local economy, hotel and restoration, 25,965 participants participated in the “training courses to obtain the occupational safety card in hotel and restoration”, with the issuance of 25,020 cards.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 01:08:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Physical Fitness | Study shows good results in preschool children</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/aptidao-fisica-estudo-mostra-bons-resultados-em-criancas-do-pre-escolar/</link><description>One study analyzed the physical fitness of preschool children in Macao. The results point to “modest growth and development”, “small increases in height and weight” and “improvements in speed, agility, muscle strength and flexibility”, thanks to the 2015 curriculum reform that bet on school sports
 
The government is to be congratulated with regard to sports in preschool, according to an academic study that evaluated children of kindergartens and statistical data of their physical fitness provided by the Institute of Sport (ID).
In "Temporal Trends of Physical Fitness in MSAR preschool children between 2002 and 2020", published in the Journal of Exercise &amp; Fitness, academics point to "modest growth and development among preschool students." Statistically evaluated parameters focus on performance in activities such as running, length jump or march. The work is by SIU Ming Choi, Faculty of Education, Grant R. Tomkinson, Justin J. Lang, Cristina Cadenas-Sanchez, Haoyu Dong, Si Man Lei, Eric Tsz Chun Poon, the latter linked to the Department of Sports Sciences and Physical Education at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
The authors have taken the annual ID data to realize how the children's body has evolved in recent years, allowing you to perceive data related to weight, height and body measurements. Thus, it is read that there were “small increases in height, weight and circumferences, improvements in speed-agility, muscle strength and flexibility of the lower body and flexibility, and declines in the muscle power of the upper body and equilibrium capacity”.
The study reveals "significant but small increases at the time, weight and circumference of the chest," while "the physical aptitude trends were contradictory, with declines ranging from insignificant to small throwing and equilibrium performance." There were also “insignificant improvements to small in other measures” of the body, with the authors to point out that “no significant differences were found between genres, which indicates equitable development” between boys and girls.
In general terms, “an increase in body size and modest but significant improvements in various components of physical fitness, such as speed-agility, muscle power, and flexibility, and flexibility, and declines elsewhere” were recorded.
The authors consider that these results “can be attributed to a combination of factors of the education system and the domestic environment”, as “the Macao Education System and the curriculum guidelines have given priority to the development of physical education and the acquisition of motor skills”.
It is also noteworthy that Macau was "the first region of China to incorporate kindergarten into its free education system since 2007, making the education of its residents a fundamental priority."
The study also mentions the 2015 curriculum reform, which “explicitly emphasizes learning fundamental movement skills, such as locomotor (walking, running, bouncing, equilibrium, trigger) and object control (launch, catch) through various physical activities and games designed by teachers”.
The work emphasizes the importance of guardians in the connection of children with sport, remembering the pandemic years. “Parents' positive influence on the modeling of physical activity can also play a role in these improvements, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when children had less opportunities for physical activity away from home.”
Academics emphasize that it is important, for the authorities, to make a “continuous monitoring” and “support the physical fitness and overall health in early childhood”, and there must be “strategies to improve global physical fitness in early childhood”.

For this study, data from children between the age of three and the age of five were analyzed in preschool, in 2002, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020, such as body size, with regard to height, weight and circumferences of the chest, waist and hip; And physical fitness, such as the 2 × 10 m shot, foot length heel, marching, continuous two -legged heel, head throttle and sitting and reaching. ”
In addition, "preschool children of six macaoal gardens were recruited through a combination of stratified and group random sampling methods." A total of 4,519 children, with 59 percent boys and 41 percent girls participated.
The results reveal “an equitable improvement of physical fitness” and the data put Macau at a better position on some European countries referred to in the study. “In contrast to previous investigations into the trends of the physical development of children and adolescents in Poland, which revealed stability at the time, but increases in weight and body mass index, our results suggest that macao preschool children have increased in size, perhaps due to the best living and nutritional conditions.”
Academics conclude that "results are particularly significant," and point out that "the improvement observed in the performance of the standing length of the pre-school of Macau is encouraging."
Such "contrasts with the investigation into similar populations in the Czech Republic and Poland, where declines were reported in the performance in the length of standing length with increases in the body mass index and in the cutaneous fold", is indicated.
Other signs
The study also reveals “a temporal improvement of flexibility in Macao preschoolers, which differs from the trends observed in pole preschoolers”, and there are “cultural, environmental factors or other factors that influence the development of flexibility in young children in different regions and populations”.
The work also points out that the masters “mixtures uniquely mix eastern and western cultures, which turns it into an intriguing scenario to examine trends in the physical fitness of preschool children”. It is also noted that "the region has a strong commitment to education, offering 15 years of free preschool education to high school and secondary education, ensuring broad access to education and development programs in early childhood childhood for all children."
The compliments of the academics continue, stressing the “remarkable life expectancy, which exceeds 84 years in 2019”, and “Macao gave priority to their health and social systems”.
“Recognizing the importance of physical health, standardized and systematic physical fitness tests were performed on people of all ages since the beginning of the century, when the government implemented a physical fitness surveillance system aligned with China's national physical fitness monitoring,” is also explained.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 00:30:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Budget 2025 | Government removes 12 billion from the estimates of the game's revenues</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/orcamento-2025-governo-retira-12-mil-milhoes-as-estimativas-das-receitas-do-jogo/</link><description>The advanced forecast in November by the executive, which pointed to 240 billion casinos gross revenues in 2025, was reviewed. The government now predicts that revenues have a break of 12 billion patacas, forcing the budgetary review yesterday by André Cheong yesterday
 
Yesterday were released by the Executive Council, the data on the budget review for this year, which happens due to the low forecast of the amount of gross revenues of the game, which depend, on large scale, the local economy and public revenues.
Thus, if the executive initially estimated that the game's gross gross revenues would be, this year, from 240 billion patacas, this value now drops to 228 billion, or 12 billion. Regarding the average monthly estimate, 19 billion patacas in gross revenues are now foreseen, because "the situation is not like the one planned."
In yesterday's presentation, the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, and also spokesman for the Executive Board, said that “after study and analysis of the current global economic conjuncture and the effective situation of exploitation of the game sector from the beginning of this year to the present moment, it is proposed that the annual estimate of gross revenues of the game will be reduced from 240 billion to 228 billion, thus serving as to Main base of the financial budget financial revenues, and that relevant budgetary revenue rules are properly adjusted. ”
In November last year, when Ho Iat Seng was about to leave the position of Chief Executive, predictions for gross revenues were 240 billion, taking into account the initial version of the budget proposal for 2025. At the time, the forecast represented an increase compared to what had been estimated to 2024, which situated the gross revenues of casinos by 216 billion Patacas, an increase of 11.1 percent. Given the gross game recipes in 2023, the estimate for 2025 was a 31.1 percent increase.
It is important to highlight that the new forecast below expected is an annual increase of only 0.5 percent in gross revenues, when the initial numbers translated into annual growth of 5.8 percent. In the first five months of this year, the game's revenues rose only 1.7 percent annually to 97.7 billion patacas.
Balance Guarantee
In response to journalists, the subdirector of finance services, Ho Silvestre in Mare, said the new calculations were based on the data provided by the Directorate of Inspection and Game Coordination Services (DICJ) in contrast to the first semester public expenses.
“In this proposed budget law we made an analysis of the global conjuncture and took into account a different model regarding the consumption of tourists in Macau. We made general considerations for these estimates and, according to DICJ, from January to April this year, an average of 19 billion and there was an increase to 21.1 billion (gross revenues). reaching the 20 billion [ragous game revenues, on average], so in the second half of the year there will be uncertainties. ”
"In this budget we intend to take a balance in expense and revenue. After an evaluation at the first half of the year, we can make an assessment taking into account the amount of 19 billion Patacas, and according to the current expense of the MSAR, we were able to get a more balanced budget," he added.
In general terms, and according to the explanatory note presented by André Cheong, the total amount of the ENGRICIAN INTEGRATED ORDINARY BUDGET for the 2025 economic year is 116.5 billion, when a revenue of the 121 billion patacas was expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to be expected to reduce the DSF's gross revenue revenue. The cut is 4.56 billion patacas.
In addition, the official said, only the reduction in the tax raised on the game, due to the break in gross revenues, translates into 450 million patacas for the administration. It should also be noted that budgetary expense within the PIDDA [Administration Development Investment and Development Plan] is reviewed to about 19.587 billion Patacas.
Budgetary expense rises 2.5 percent due to education and social support
The government ensures that, in the proposal for a budget for this year, the construction of a new campus of the University of Macau (one) on Hengqin Island will contribute, in part, to the increase in expense, around 2.5 percent, as well as “the increase in the budget in relation to subsidies attributed to vulnerable groups and investment in research and scientific and technological development”.
In the budget proposal presented yesterday, there is a approximate amount of 1.7 billion Patacas for the construction of the new UM campus, said the subdirect of Finance Services (DSF). In addition, at the level of scientific and technological investment was added the amount of 340 million patacas “for investments in the scope of science and technology, such as the acquisition of laboratory devices, to satisfy the measure and policies of the Government of Masters,” said Ho Silvestre in Mais.
"For construction is expected an expense of about eight billion patacas. As the campus is built on Hengqin Island, the cost must be calculated in Renminbis, which is about seven billion. This is the data we can have at this time," said the official.
Support for support
With regard to social support, the budget proposal for this year reveals an increase of 2.86 billion of Patacas in the expected expenses, as a way of reinforcing these supports. In total, the rise in expenses is 2.5 percent, to 116.2 billion patacas.
Quanto à elaboração do Orçamento para o próximo ano, está a ser preparado e a palavra de ordem é a contenção. "We are already elaborating the budget for the year 2026, and all services of the Government of MSAR need to consider more about their expenses, especially given the current conjuncture. In the budgetary elaboration phase we take a prudent and rigorous attitude towards the expenses," said the subdirector of DSF.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:29:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Crime | “Illicit game” with an increase of more than 900 percent</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/28/criminalidade-jogo-ilicito-com-aumento-superior-a-900-por-cento/</link><description>The changes to the “Law on Combating Unlawful Game Crimes”, which added the crime of illegal exchange, led to more occurrences. Only in a year was there an increase of 906.3 percent of crimes associated with the “illicit game”. The data are related to the first quarter of this year and were released yesterday by Secretary Wong Sio Chak
 
The law has changed and the crime increased. It was like this with the illegal exchange rate in casinos, as the activity began to be criminalized by the change to the “law to combat illicit gaming crimes” last year.
According to the balance of crime made yesterday, the crimes associated with the illicit game rose 906.3 percent, with 161 cases in the first quarter of this year compared to last year, growth enhanced by illegal exchange cases. The legislative change in question “led to a large increase of this type of crime, especially with regard to illegal exchange,” was mentioned.
In adding the crime of “illicit exchange exchange for game”, it was thus adjusted “the scope of coverage of some related crimes, resulting in the increase in crimes related to the illicit game”, it was added.
At yesterday's press conference, Secretary for Security, Wong Sio Chak, said that police authorities will continue to “reinforce the work of prevention and execution of the law”, and follow “and analyze the development of crime”.
Exchanges and Baldrocas
In general terms, the game -associated crimes also increased, with 567 inquiries, 216 compared to the first quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 61.5 percent.
According to a press release of Wong Sio Chak's office, "it is believed that the main cause of this increase is related to the criminalization of" illegal money "," the dismantling of several relevant criminal networks in joint operations, as well as uncertain factors in society resulting from increased tourist. "
In the overview of the crime, the police instituted, in total, 3,289 criminal investigations, which represents a decrease of 260 cases and translates a decide of 7.3 percent for the same period of the year 2024.

According to the authorities, "more than half were situations in which taxi drivers did not wait for the order of customers in taxi squares." Police say they have "dealt with cases in accordance with the law and appealed to offenders not to break the law again."</description><pubDate>2025-05-28 23:47:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Literature | Must bets on Camões translation project to Chinese</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/27/literatura-must-aposta-em-projecto-de-traducao-de-camoes-para-chines/</link><description>The University of Science and Technology of Macau is betting on Luís de Camões translation projects. At a time when they celebrate the 500th anniversary of the birth of the poet, Filipe de Saavedra, Academic of the Local University, speaks of the initiative and the Middle Middle Congress of the Birth of Luís de Camões, in Mozambique
 
Last year, 500 years were completed from the birth of the one who is considered the greatest Portuguese poet of all time. Luís de Camões, author of the epic “Os Lusíadas”, was born in 1524, sailed the seas and traveled lands where the Portuguese walked, namely Mozambique, Goa and Macao, among others, and on them left poems and writings in letters. Its importance is mirrored in the celebrations of June 10 - Portugal, Camões and the Portuguese Communities.
All the literary manifestations that Camões has left written will now be translated into Chinese thanks to a project that has been developed by the University of Science and Technology of Macao (Must, English acronym). Filipe de Saavedra, specialist in the life and work of Luís de Camões, professor and researcher at this University and PhD in Portuguese Studies, spoke to HM about the project.
“Our translations will come out of a project ongoing at UCTM [Must in the Acronym in English] where the full translation of Chinese of all lyrical genres and letters of Camões is foreseen. Students have been exposed to the poet from the first year of the degree in Portuguese studies to the master's degree, and their response is enthusiastic. Macao '. We had already had the same success with the Indonesian students.
"The most ambitious project is that of the critical edition of the work, which we are starting with letters and odes. It will combine the accumulated efforts of various generations of scholars with our new readings of the manuscripts, and new interpretations. It will be the most lasting and most necessary contribution by these celebrations," added the Camonist.
Must also have the theater studio project in which “students represent Camões”, and this year in this year's poetry contest, students chose to recite Camões, demonstrating great sensitivity to his poetry ”. For Filipe de Saavedra, "the seed is launched, and from there will come the translators and camons of the future."
Given Macau's strong connection in the life of Luís de Camões, the territory welcomed the “I Congress of Middle Millennium”, representing academics from various countries with studies around the figure, work and life of Luís de Camões.
The balance made by Filipe de Saavedra is quite positive. “We have already brought three times the master-transtor Zhang Weimin, always with the support of the Oriente Foundation, which gave several master classes on how to translate Camões into Mandarin to UCTM's most advanced courses.”
In this context, Must has established "protocols with foreign universities where there are Camonian centers for common initiatives." One of the most recent was with Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique to hold the second edition of the same Congress next June, Maputo and the Island.
Camões in Mozambique
According to Philip de Saavedra, "Congress takes place on special days for Camões, and in places he dwelt: February 25, the most likely date of his birth and March 12, the date of the publication of the epic; and now June 10, the poet's death day in Lisbon."
"As Camões lived two years on the island of Mozambique, late or early we would have been held. Congresses about Camões in Portugal and Brazil, but this is the first that gathers throughout Africa, and in Asia we also did two, one in Indonesia and one in Macao, the first on this continent," he explained.
In Mozambique, the professor will talk about “about Africans in general [present] in the work of Camões”, and other academics will “take care of his relationship with Mozambique, with other people who have passed through the time he was there, of translation issues that are always primal, and the teaching of Camões in schools”. According to the Academic, this Congress has the support of the Portuguese National Commission for the celebrations of the V Centenary of Camões.
Filipe de Saavedra is also part of the “Camões Network in Asia &amp; Africa”, which brings together several experts in Camões and has organized the Middle Millennium Congresses. "The chamonism network we have implemented in Asia will be true to its translating meeting point matrix with exegetes. It is characterized by a global and plural perspective, centered on texts, but anchoring equally on the vital experience of the poet, specifically in his Asian and African experiences. This is a different point of view from that of Portugal."
The III Middle Millennium Congress will take place next year in Goa, in partnership with the University of Goa. "We will deepen the relations of Camões with India of that time, and not only with Portuguese India. We are offering co-inmates to Indian students of Master and PhD who want to work Camões, as well as bibliographic assistance. We will also invest in the search for new translators of Camões poetry for the various Indian languages," he said.
Missing writings
Asked what the poet's work is to be analyzed and investigated, the Must researcher highlights the few advances at the level of the work, and more in the biographical aspect. “In the twentieth century, and in what goes from the 21st, it has advanced above all in the knowledge of Camões's life. But as for the work, progress has been slower. Despite the fundamental contributions provided by Portuguese and foreign scholars, it can be said that no lyric editions are still up to its whole as definitive, and the same as those of theater.
Philip de Saavedra points out that "a lot is done and a lot is to do," but as far as the poet's hectic life is concerned, "there are many aspects of Camões's life where we even know too much, on matters that he might have not liked to know so much."
"Even the study of the lyric would already be an abuse for him, since he did not want to gather or publish, when he could easily have done it after the success of" Os Lusíadas ". It was a renegade part of his work, not to mention the private letters, some very private. Therefore all this excess of knowledge, this one knows almost everything about life and about the work of Camões, represents for us a miracle, and for him," he added.
For Philip de Saavedra, "the distressing dilemma between respecting the will and privacy of an author, and pending to the intimate recesses his earthly existence, even probing his most intimate thoughts." "Here we are forced to weigh the interest of the individual on the one hand, ideally assistance, and the interest of culture and history by the other, which is greater and sovereign. It wins the second, and that Camões forgive us," he concludes.</description><pubDate>2025-05-27 22:56:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | As Bachará and businessman Yip Hon helped cement STDM</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/26/jogo-como-o-bacara-e-o-empresario-yip-hon-ajudaram-a-cimentar-a-stdm/</link><description>Jorge Godinho, a jurist and expert in the history of the Macao Game, published an article that highlights Stanley Ho's legacy and how Bachará and businessman Yip Hon were essential in building the Empire of the Macao Tourism Society. Yesterday five years of the death of the King of the Macao Game were completed
 
The magazine “Gaming Law Review” has just been published, an analysis article by academic Jorge Godinho who portrays the essential pieces that helped build the EMTDM Empire - Macao's Tourism and Amusement Society and the legacy that Stanley Ho has left in the game industries and entertainment of the territory. STDM founders were Yip Hon, Teddy Yip, Henry Fok and Stanley Ho.
In “The Place of Stanley Ho (1921-2020) In Macao Casino Gaming History” [The Place of Stanley Ho (1921-2020) in the history of the Casino game in Macao], it is concluded that given the little knowledge and mastery of the functioning of the Fortune Games and unlucky by the Hong Kong tycoon, it turned out to be Yip Hon the great stratega of STD in this area. And that, in the early years, Bachará was the game that gave fortune to the pockets of STDM managers.
“Yip Hon was behind the main changes of 1975-1976: the turn to the baccará and the use of a game promoters network. Stanley Ho was a very intelligent entrepreneur, with an extremely attentive look at business opportunities. It was decisive in taking the opportunity offered by reforms and the 1961-1962 public contest and creating STDM. However, this is not necessarily the same as having experience in game In general and in Bachará in particular, ”wrote Jorge Godinho at the conclusion.
The visiting professor at the University of Macao and teacher at Ismat - Instituto Superior Manuel Teixeira Gomes cites a dialogue between Stanley Ho and CNN journalist Lorraine Hahn, in an interview of 2004, in which she assumes her weak knowledge of the intricacies of the game's functioning.
“I don't realize anything about gambling, I still don't play. I got this concession because it was a challenge for myself, because I can't see why Hong Kong was so prosperous and Macau was a dying city, just 40 miles away. So, once again, I love challenges, I presented a proposal and won the concession. Stanley Ho, adding that he was only interested in sport. “Well, I like that name [King of the Game], but to be very frank I don't deserve this 'king of the casino', I don't play, how can I be the king of the casino?” Stanley Ho asked in response to the journalist.
Jorge Godinho's article points out that “in the early years, and during the period when the great turn to Bachará, the driving force of the game on STDM was Yip Hon (1904-1997), the true expert of the STDM game”, whose importance was recognized by Stanley Ho himself.
"Due to the time I spent in Macau, I knew everyone there and, in 1961, when there was a contest for the game concession, I joined some friends and made a proposal for the casino-and we won the franchise. I was working with Mr. Henry Fok, my brother-in-law Teddy Yip and Yip Hon, who was a professional player." Magnata, quoted in the article.
Yip Hon was "the only shareholder of STDM game expert", and in the early years of the company, Bachará gradually assumed more importance, gaining prominence against games such as Blackjack and Roulette, "both in the mass market and in the segment of the big bets."
Data cited by Jorge Godinho, from the direction of inspection and game coordination services, on the name with the name inspection of game contracts, show a “obvious” rise of bacacará, which was the biggest game in 1977, with 37 percent of market share, and 65 percent quota in 1984. “On the other hand, all other games diminished their relative weight,” adds the author of the article.
Divide the cake
The STDM monopoly in Macao lasted exactly 40 years and three months-from January 1, 1962 to March 31, 2002, when authorities decided to liberalize the market, bringing to the US concessionaires territory.
The article is referred to in Stanley Ho's public position regarding the arrival of new operators and the style of company that brought news to what was going on in Macao, with more international event events. "They want to imitate Las Vegas, create large spaces focused on family entertainment. This is good for Macau. As for our usual customers, they come to play as soon as they enter the casino. They have no time to see other things," said the Magnata.
From the STDM was born the Macau Game Society (SJM) that ran for the public tender for the assignment of new concessions and which won one, but for Jorge Godinho there may have been a poor analysis of future competition, which partly affected the operator's position.
"SJM may have forgotten its own past and may have repeated some of the mistakes made by TAI Heng in the 1961 public tender, starting with overconfidence. SJM may have understood that, as one of the concessions would always be attributed, it would not be worth making 'excessive' commitments. This approach turned out to be incorrect," he reads.
The study refers to 1961, when the previous concessionaire to STDM, Tai Heng Ltd, faced this contest “too optimistic and may have underestimated potential competition in a competition process in which the decision is essentially based on a very simple and direct base: the amount of the offered income”. "Tai Heng may have expected that there was no competition, given the amount of the necessary investment," said Jorge Godinho.
Competition
In 2001, Macao had left behind the Portuguese administration and was already mashed. The analyzes of the future of the game without monopoly were therefore prudent. "Although in 2001 it was believed that there was the potential to grow and transform the market through the introduction of competition, at the time expectations were not very high. In a somewhat conservative, careful or incremental movement, the decision was made (only) three concessions. In fact, in 2001, no one could have predicted the huge development that actually occurred in the following years."
The crime marked by sects in the late 1990s was "very fresh" and "the decision makers were very prudent." "There were questions about whether large international companies would be present in the 2001 public tender. There was also the perception that many years would be needed for new operators to effectively generate some kind of significant competition for the old STDM monopoly."
According to Jorge Godinho, "with the benefit of the retrospective, it is quite clear that these perceptions were not in accordance with what happened," because "the years following 2001 were characterized by historical growth and qualitative transformations."
Jorge Godinho recalls that although it was “widely expected that one of the concessions was attributed to SJM”, the truth is that the company “was classified in third place - which is not an excellent position”. "Perhaps because pre-concessioned investment projects were not seen as the best for what was intended to be a future dominated by mass tourism in Macau and with increasing diversification. SJM will have estimated that the new competition would not remove it too much market share, especially in the VIP sector," he added.
The place today
At the time of the development of the first projects of great wingspan in Cotai, Jorge Godinho highlights how the “driving force was Venetian, led by Sheldon Adelson”, who brought to the territory the largest casino in the world, the Venetian. It was “a very strong bet in Macau, which gave good results,” said the author of the study, who points out that SJM quickly lost ground in the market.
"The lead role in these projects [at Cotai] was not played by SJM. The loss of SJM market share began in 2004 and was relatively rapid. In 2009, SJM continued to lead, 31 percent of quota, but market leadership was lost in 2014 and never returned. Godinho.
The study also brings data on the current position of SJM after the hard years of the pandemic, and already in the context of the attribution of new gambling licenses, totaling six.
“SJM was the last operator to open a large resort integrated in the Cotai area,” it reads, following that, from the third quarter of 2023, the market share per GGR [Gross Gaming Revenue-Gross Revenue] was 26.9 percent for Vetnetian, 18 percent for Galaxy, 14.6 percent for MGM, 14.5 percent For Melco, 13.4 percent for Wynn and 12.1 percent for SJM.
Thus, what has occurred in recent years was “the inevitable loss of importance of SJM” taking into account “intense competition since the end of the monopoly in 2001”. “SJM is currently in the last position. SJM Resorts is the main casino operator in Macao only in a specific metric: the number of casinos (13). This is mainly due to its long history and the legacy of 'satellite casinos'. 2022, the SJM was classified in sixth position - the last among historical operators ”, stresses Jorge Godinho.</description><pubDate>2025-05-26 23:00:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Tim Wong presented yesterday application</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/eleicoes-tim-wong-apresentou-ontem-propositura-de-candidatura/</link><description>For now, it seems that the next legislative elections will have a new list head. Tim Wong, who directs the Macao and Myanmar Friendship Association and founded the Association of the Promotion of Citizens and Economics, presented yesterday the request for the Constitution of the Application Commission to the Electoral Affairs Committee of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal).
The list presented yesterday, composed of local and foreign residents of Macao, began to be thought of two years ago and was now handed over to Caeal the request for the constitution of a commission, signed by 500 residents.
Among the issues that move the candidacy, the list head highlights as a priority the support for the subsistence of the most disadvantaged groups, the quality of life of the population and the survival of small and medium enterprises.
Although Tim Wong shared opinions on various topics on social networks, and even delivered a petition to the government to reducing non-resident workers, the list does not yet have a complete political program, but is being prepared, yesterday guaranteed the potential candidate in statements after submitting the application for application.
After a career in the civil service, Tim Wong returned to university to do his doctorate and, in 2014, moved to the private sector and social services. The associative leader understands that, nowadays, there are not in the Legislative Assembly voices that represent the vulnerable groups of society.
In this regard, the potential candidate for deputy mentioned the changes to the rules of attribution of pecuniary checks, criticizing the fact that there was no public consultation, not a period of transition to the changes.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:41:06</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | RON LAM DELIVERS APPLICATION APPLICATION, WITHOUT LIST</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/eleicoes-ron-lam-entrega-pedido-de-candidatura-ainda-sem-lista/</link><description>Macau synergy delivered yesterday the request for the constitution of candidacy for the legislatures. Without confirming if it will be a list head, Ron Lam said he wants to continue to be a bridge between the government and the population. About his first term, Ron Lam confessed to feeling powerless, despite the effort to demonstrate his opinions
 
The Macau Synergy Association yesterday handed over to the Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) the request for the constitution of the Candidacy Commission for Legislative Elections. The Association led by President Johnson Ian and Vice-President and Deputy Ron Lam also handed over about four hundreds of signatures to support the candidacy.
Despite confessing that I would like to continue to give voice to the population, for the association of Macau synergy, it does not have a list formed, a fact that Ron Lam justified with limited resources and lack of time. "Regarding who will be the head of the list, our team will still argue, but I believe there are those who want me to keep my place in Hemiciclo. But it is important to obey the team's decision," he said.
Regarding his first term of deputy, who is about to end, Ron Lam confessed some frustration between commitment, his expectations and how they were not reflected in political reality. "I applied myself to legislative work with effort, participated in all meetings and expressed my opinions, but the results did not correspond to what I expected," he said.
To the other bank
Speaking in the public administration building, Ron Lam defended the importance of making the government the different opinions of the population, the mission that the deputy and potential candidate admits to want to continue to perform.
In fact, public opinion perceived by the deputy and the suggestions that result from public consultations of the executive continue to present major discrepancies. Ron Lam argues that these differences make governance not correspond to the wishes and expectations of the population for social development.
"We hope to continue effectively the role of bridge between society and the government, reflecting the opinions of the population. We also hope that the executive will decide more political, seriously and humble, in accordance with popular will," said Ron Lam.
The deputy gave as an example of situations in which the executive turned back after public opinions, which gave voice, the suspension of the works that would erect a giant statue of the goddess Kun iam in Coloane. "Although we can often not do better, in others we get the authorities to follow the way we point out."
The same was not true of changes to the form of attribution of the pecuniary check, where Ron Lam claims to have lacking communication between the government and society, not even through public consultation.
Caeal | Bom Lar Alliance Delivery
The Good Lar Alliance yesterday handed over to the Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) the request for the constitution of the Candidacy Commission, with 500 signatures. According to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, the agent of the Bom Lar Alliance Candidacy Commission is Iong Weng Ian, who is also president of the Fiscal Council of the General Association of Macao Women.
According to the presentation, the Good Home Alliance intends to fight for an improvement in the rights of women and children, and in a second phase, will listen to and collect social opinions to elaborate the political program and organize the list of candidates to the next elections for the Legislative Assembly.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Work | Ella Law wants to combat Idadism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/trabalho-ella-lei-quer-combater-idadismo/</link><description>Deputy Ella Lei intends to combat Idadism, so that middle -aged people can have more job opportunities.

Ella Lei also calls for an in -depth analysis of the fact that young trainees do not continue to work in the same companies that welcomed them, under the internship program funded by the executive.
Given the recent creation of the working group for the coordination of employment promotion, the deputy calls focus on the groups of unemployed persons or who have long -term difficulties in search of employment, especially young people licensed, middle -aged people and the elderly.
The deputy thinks that this group needs to analyze the reasons for long -term unemployment, even though statistics show that these unemployed have different ages. However, for the deputy these data do not explain some concrete cases of long employed seasons.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:34:41</pubDate></item><item><title>New Hope | Delivered application for 500 signatures</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/nova-esperanca-entregue-pedido-de-candidatura-com-500-assinaturas/</link><description>With a total of 500 signatures, the New List of Hope was the spokesman for Deputy José Pereira Coutinho who dismissed the scenario from being disqualified from the elections. For unraveling was the taboo about the position of Rita Santos on the list
 
The new hope list of Deputy José Pereira Coutinho, linked to the Macao Public Function Workers Association (ATFPM), delivered yesterday the request for recognition of the candidacy committee with 500 signatures. However, this is not yet the case that the taboo was broken over the position of Rita Santos on the list that should participate in the suffrage of September 14.
"I'm on the list, but I have to respect my colleagues, who are here. We are still ultimately the chaining of the list, because the goal, as I said, is having a voice from the list of new hopes and a very satisfactory result," said José Pereira Coutinho. "She [Rita Santos] will be on the list. Now how she will be is that I still have to talk to my colleagues, but it will be," he said.
Before delivering the request for recognition of the application committee, and although several lists of a more critical spectrum of the government were disqualified in 2021, Coutinho considered that these will be the most difficult elections of recent years: "No, it is not bluff, it is really difficult because there will be more lists, and the lists are strong," he said. "Nowadays, those traditional lists have a very important weight because they have a great financial capacity that can move buildings. And I don't say moving boats or cars, they are the same, with their foundations, which can be moved within two weeks," he said. "The list will have a very close fight, but I hope people are aware that vote is a very important act," he added.
Unintended
Until June 6, the lists have to deliver the request for recognition of the application committee. After this process, if everything is in accordance with applicable legislation, the Legislative Assembly Electoral Affairs Committee (Caeal) recognizes the application committee and lists may present its candidates.
The names of the candidates are then subjected to a political process, led by the State Security Defense Commission, chaired by the Chief Executive, and in which representatives of the interior, such as advisers, have the power to veto the names presented. The decision is final and does not allow judicial appeal.
However, yesterday, José Pereira Coutinho devalued the possibility of being disqualified, despite recognizing being critical of the government. "Oh no, I don't think I will be disqualified]. The fact that being critical does not mean that I am not a patriot, I am also a patriot, so that we have always worked for the good of Macao and for the good of the citizens of Macao," he said. “Confident!” He concluded.
Greater transparency
Regarding the competition of other lists, Coutinho defended the need for the authorities to ensure that the elections will take place with transparency, not only to ensure that the results are fair, but also not to be transmitted a bad example for young people in Macao.
The deputy also criticized the attitude of various associations, not to mention names, who accused that they have taken advantage of helping the government to distribute to the elderly the card under the consumer carnival to collect signatures for the candidacy commissions. According to Pereira Coutinho, several seniors declared support for other candidacy committees, without being aware of what they were doing, when they intended to support the new hope. In 2021 the New Hope list was the third most voted force, with a total of 18,323 votes.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:33:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Elections | Residents deliver application for application</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/eleicoes-moradores-entregam-pedido-de-candidatura/</link><description>The General Union of Macao Residents Associations (Ugamm) yesterday submitted the request for recognition of the application committee to participate in the legislative elections, according to the newspaper or Mun.
As traditionally happens with residents, the list is designated as a promoter union for progress, and the agent is NG Siu Lai, president of Ugamm. According to the rules in force, each application committee needs to have at least 300 signatures of residents with electoral capacity. The Ugamm list features 500 signatures.
According to the newspaper or Mun, NG said the list is essentially focused on daily affairs, such as housing, transport and public safety. Regarding the name of the candidates, the agent referred to the information later. Still, he promised an effort to represent “all sectors of the population” of Macao.
Currently, the Promoting Union list for progress has two deputies elected by direct suffrage: Leong Hong Sai and Ngan Iek Hang. In an electoral act that was marked by the exclusion of several candidates, for political reasons, the list was the second most voted in 2021 with 23,761 votes.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:31:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Parents may request childhood subsidy from July 16</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/pais-podem-pedir-subsidio-de-infancia-a-partir-de-16-de-julho/</link><description>At yesterday's press conference of the Executive Board, the administrative regulation that officializes a new social support was also presented. This is the “Childhood Assistance Subsidy Plan”, intended for children up to three years old, which may be requested by parents from July 16. The administrative regulation shall enter into force the day before.
15,000 children are covered, with resident status, for the new support announced in the Governing Action Lines (LAG) for this year. The allowance will have the value of 1,500 patacas, totaling 54 thousand patacas. The purpose of the measure is to encourage the increase in the birth rate.
In concrete terms, children are benefited from this year and 2027, and parents can apply through the Macao Single Account platform, "with the deadline to present the candidacy not to exceed June 30 of the year following the birth of the child." In addition, according to the presentation yesterday, “case on January 1 of the following year, [the child] continues to meet the respective requirements and such fact has been verified by the Institute of Social Action, the benefit of the allowance is maintained, without the necessary formalities”.
The beacons and the game
The subsidy will be paid by bank transfer, and “when it comes to a new application, the allowance will be paid within 60 days from the day following its approval”. "In case of maintenance of the satisfaction of the requirements for the benefit of the allowance, the payment will take place in the 2nd quarter of the year of assignment," he adds.
Another clarification concerns children born before 2025, but they have not yet completed three years, or celebrate their birthday when the new law is entry into force, which are now covered. That is, residents born between 2022 and 2024 are also included in the new support.
It should be noted that “there is no place to attribute the subsidy to the child when it is entrusted, by court judgment, the institution or equipment subsidized by the government, or whose tutor is the guardian or worker of this institution or equipment”.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:30:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Infiltration | Requests improvements in the arbitration system</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/03/infiltracoes-pedidas-melhorias-no-sistema-de-arbitragem/</link><description>Deputy Ma Io Fong wants to know how the government will deal with cases where housing owners do not meet arbitral decisions about water infiltration. The question is a written interpellation, released on the weekend.
Between January and May more than eight percent of the owners have ceased to comply with the decisions of the arbitral courts, from agreements with the data from the Interservices Center to treat water infiltration in the buildings, cited by the deputy of the Association of Women.
Faced with the scenario of non -compliance with decisions, the deputy hopes that the government can provide more support to the affected, so that the situations can be resolved.
MA IO Fong also criticized the fact that it is currently necessary to wait a long time for the Macao Civil Engineering laboratory to perform the analyzes of water infiltration cases. Therefore, the deputy suggests that the government will begin to subsidize tests by private entities, in order to relieve the volume of work of LECM and accelerate the obtaining of results.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 01:18:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Wealth</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/riqueza/</link><description>UBS's “Global Global Wealth Report for 2024” points out that Swiss are the richest people in the world, with an average active of $ 709. 600 US dollars. Secondly, come the Luxembourg, with an average active of 607,500 dollars. Hong Kongers are third, with an average active of $ 582,000, equivalent to about 4.54 million dollars from Hong Kong.
"Wealth" includes personal and other active income after debt, also designated by "net value".
The report also points out that the percentage of millionaires in Hong Kong is about 10 percent, ie out of ten adult residents of Hong Kong one is a millionaire. The report provides that Hong Kong in 2028 will be 17.3 percent of millionaires.
In the “ranking of the richest regions in the world in 2024”, another report published by the financial magazine “Forbes”, Luxembourg appears first with a GDP of $ 143,740, Macao ranks second with a GDP of $ 1340s and Hong Kong qualifies in 15th place with a $ 75,130 US GDP.
Two different financial reports show the financial situation of Hong Kong and Macao and there are several points worth mentioning:
First, Hong Kong millionaires represent about 10 percent of the population and Macau's GDP emerges as the second tallest in the world. These data indicate the strength of the two administrative regions and their impressive achievements under the principle "one country, two systems."
Second, Macao presents a per capita GDP of 134,140 USD. As we all know, Macau's main source of revenue comes from the game and this number reflects the sector's contribution to the city's economy.
The game sector brings considerable income to Macau, but also includes hidden dangers. Although the pandemic has already ended, the economy has not fully recovered and the game's recipes have decreased, which inevitably affects people's livelihood. Macao's economy should be moderately diversified and its dependence on the game sector should decrease in order to improve everyone's lives.
Third, Hong Kong's per capita GDP is 75,130 USD. Unlike Macao, Hong Kong has no industries that generate great recipes. If Hong Kong wants to improve its classification, it has to create industries that bring more recipes to the city.
Fourth, the average active of Hong Kong millionaires are about 582,000 USD. Hong Kong's most valuable assets are known to be related to real estate. If an active of a millionaire include a home, but if this home is their housing, then this property represents only a facial value. If the house is sold, it gets a lot of money, but needs to buy another house to live. Therefore, the financial effect of this type of assets is limited.
Wealth brings security and is a source of pride to everyone. Both financial reports demonstrate the financial stability of the two special administrative regions. However, as the economy has not completely recovered after the pandemic, people should be more careful in managing their finances and giving their best to enjoy the pleasure that wealth brings.

Imagine a civil servant to win in one day 51,000 euros. Impossible? No. It happened at the Santa Maria hospital in Lisbon with our money. A dermatologist and other elements of your team have gained 850,000 euros on just 10 Saturdays. Only the doctor in question has gained 450 thousand euros in 10 days. How was it possible? It is under investigation because it is a scandalous fraud.
At stake is the so -called Sigic, the integrated surgery management system for surgery, a system that allows you to have surgeries outside work hours to mitigate long waiting lines in hospitals. If on the one hand, productivity increases and diminishes waiting lists, on the other, it is a financial incentive for health professionals, given that they receive money for it. Now, for doctors to have surgeries over the weekend, they have to meet a goal. There must be a maximum limit of sense not to exceed one third of the total surgical production. Each of those interested in participating in Sigic in 2024 should produce regular surgery registered as such in a system in the estimated proportion of 3: 1. That is, it would be necessary to perform 66 outpatient surgeries to be able to do a day of Segic with 22 patients. The minimum allowed proportion is 2: 1.
Dermatologist Miguel Alpalhão headed a team with more colleagues and a nurse. The case is giving to talk every day in the press and television channels. The hospital's managing president himself said he had been a stunted, but has been publicly public that hospital management was already aware of what had happened a few months ago. "It is not possible that five -hour surgery pay about 900 euros and there are then doctors to earn more than three thousand euros for taking a signal," a Santa Maria professional vented to Saturday magazine.
The biggest problem is that the case of Miguel Alpalhão may be particular in the magnitude of the values ​​involved, but it seems that there are other public hospitals - and more medical specialties, as well as dermatology - where financial incentives under Sigic, to operate for regular working hours, have no control. A manager with knowledge of what is happening in the specialty of ophthalmology said that there are ophthalmologists to do dozens of simple interventions to catarats on Saturdays and Sundays, who gain tens of thousands of euros. And in this case, the scandal will be very serious in the history of the National Health Service completely paid by the State Budget, which means money spent belonging to all Portuguese.
But the whole currency has two faces. Imagine that in a case where you already talk about the expulsion of the doctor Miguel Alpalhão, he went to the medical course because when he was young had a disease for which there was no clinical explanation. In 2016 it was the best of his year to leave the Lisbon Medical School.
He chose dermatology because he wanted a good life. Those who worked with him describe him as “a Dr. House” with a unique visual memory. The 400,000 euros he received for ten Saturdays at the Santa Maria hospital did not drag him just for a scandal - they put on the radar the financial surgeries of the surgeries in the NHS outside the regular time. As a 24 -year -old man won the Professor Manuel Machado Macedo award for graduating with the best grade of his year at the Lisbon School of Medicine.
A doctor who worked with him describes the dermatologist, whom he met when he passed as an internal (holder of a paid internship) at his service in Santa Maria, as “a Dr. House”, in reference to the character in the fictional series, which has a sometimes less common deal and an innate talent for diagnoses. “It has a unique visual memory, made diagnoses that no one else did in the internship,” says his teacher. There were older doctors to ask him doubts about more pussy cases, something unusual in the middle. "It has a bright head," said the same teacher.
It was, like so many other doctors-whose post-university formation is largely sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry-in the radar of some laboratories (in all received 23,422 euros in six years, according to the Transparency Portal, almost everything paid in kind-travel, congresses and the like). He is an assistant professor at the college where he graduated, according to his profile on the CUF website (where he is also listed as a clinician at the Discoveries Hospital in Lisbon and in another in Torres Vedras).
However, the prosecutor has already opened an inquiry into everything that happened with doctor Miguel Alpalhão and his team in Santa Maria. However, we can not fail to refer to the statements of the Minister of Health that came to say that the case "is very serious" and that "an investigation has already begun."
But does anyone believe that a minister has the competence to hold a position of vital importance such as health and knew nothing of what was going on in various hospitals in the country?
With cases of this nature and with what came to light also last week about corruption of other civil servants in the Air Force, who were already notified as defendants of suspicion of active and passive corruption in the acquisition of helicopters injuring the state (all of us) in about 200 million euros, how can we admire that André Ventura's party has increased his vote with the Portuguese?</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 01:36:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Atlantis</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/atlantida/</link><description>Putting now in May Light, summer always seems to come earlier in aquatic vertigo, and in this eagerness to follow its bonanza we do not realize what the sea tells us in the confines of its enigmatic nature. The sea is the liquid movement that the earth has expelled from its domains, and with it we go as dazzled in the first dawn of good days.
Millions of feet extend toward you like a pendulum where you should follow, that no one turns your head. One might think that a sunbath is changed to us and we changed with position, but an image would be inconceivable.
We know today that any dystopia is of continental effect, but utopia always encompasses the island, in the first case it is superb, in the second, the world tends to a fraternal equality «… that land of softness that of the left edge of the world is gone…” and what is right is that this caption fits in us as a badge in some widespread steps.  There are likelihoods that give us the legend, such as the flood, which Plato later identifies as the impact of a destruction. Perhaps if it had based on a long oral tradition that departed from Egypt and was later adapted in the form of an unfinished poem, letting out a date that intrigues: twelve thousand years, which places the flood in the time where hypothetically the Atlantis sank. In any case, the lord of the cave myth was very attentive to the distant movements of a conscience that never left our chimeras. The fact that it is lost fills the space of things that could have been possible and we missed it, or were only taken, and that when they disappear put us in a cosmos where everything is dream, collapse and memory.
There is a star named Scheat that is in the constellation of Pegasus and is today in the finalization of fish where Saturn has joined it, and often the myths linked to the seas outlined with intense perception in this Neptunian cycle with a long diluvian common memory, at certain times the tide height is between clouds, and we are a serious effect of a souvenir that runs like those very refined glimpses reaches.
Neste plano muito cósmico, civilizador e quase inefável, o indivíduo é um elemento inexistente, não há ninguém que nos fale de um só dos seus habitantes nem das hierarquias, mas fala-se desses atlantes como de uma dimensão quase paralela que habitou a Terra e onde alguns afirmam terem sido salvos do desastre – que todos no mundo procuram as marcas de um quebranto marítimo, e todas as suas descrições são válidas, e toda a busca uma estrada where we walk on the waters. This filter where the craving of truth hides is a stimulus we left and we call utopia. It will be an essential element to capture the union network around the world and weaken the geophysical attributes of the backyards of some who are distant from others and each.
From the pillars of Hercules to immigration to Gaul, to America, to the ruins of Mayan, this participatory subtitle is in all the ground where humanity adheres to a strange ordinary root and creates the longest myth. Let us also make sure of the literary impact and let us see how the creative domain was the least refrained from remembering it: the Russian Empire resumes the theme in two of its poets at the end of the ease, Frederick Tennyson, English poet, Manuel de Falla, and the painting of Léon Bakst, and would be a post-spectrum work of this legacy that many believe Being more hyperborean… perhaps, after all, it is the people of the northern those who always hold Atlantis for unimaginable brums, but it will always be Fernando Pessoa who will be in the prophecies of myth giving him contours that no one has seen. It is a poem that begins like this:/ I do not know if it is a dream, if it reality, if a mixture of dream and life/ that land of softness that from the left edge of the southern if we see/ is the one we long/ there, there/ life is young and love smiles. (…) Happy, us? There, perhaps, maybe/ in that land, this time/
Freedom creates and recreates in the great march of time, and if we wish it as a clear water we should always go further and deeper, than it is redemptive catastrophe. Perhaps this eagerness to see the sea and be with it is nothing but a baptismal desire to the healthy bodies of the enslaved, and this unknown Atlantis is a lost fragment they never imagined.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 02:13:33</pubDate></item><item><title>The Great America (IV)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/29/a-grande-america-iv-2/</link><description>(Continuation of the May 22 edition)
Why is Putin not having a free hand to Ukraine? And when it threatens to tear Granelândia, one way or another, to the Atlantic Denmark (or themselves), in terms that could theoretically trigger a relief to those harmed through Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, will not bury NATO, Russia's existential objective? And at the same time, mark the vacuity of the anti-chinese quadrilateral and similar alignments, always intended to be revoked? We depart from the principle that we do not have any document paraphrased by Trump, Putin or another. On the contrary, we are certain that we could never do better than writer Leonardo Scascia, since among gentlemen the paramilitary understandings are filed with a virtual hand grip.
But what if we did it? We would have a report of the great confrontation with the following content. Title: “For a new order of chaos”. Parentheses attributable to Minuteman. First. We share a common interest in perpetuating the existence of each other's empires, as well as our own. (Accomplices smiles.) Second. We noticed that a war between us would not have winners. All losers. (Mutual congratulations.)
Third. In common, we will have a hidden enemy tomorrow who is now our supreme asset, the AI. Let us fear that it seizes our command and eliminate us to all, along with the rest of humanity. (The last five words seem unmofited.) Fourth. We have established a common red line to be extended to the rest of the states and imposed, if necessary, by force (here Putin resembles Trump the five Roosevelt policies, gently) how to prohibit the development of AI beyond the threshold that would not allow us to control it. (evokes Fausto, reading from the cave in disgraced adolescence. Trump's fingers hit impatience.) Fifth and last. Any change to the great confrontation requires unanimity. (The three largest world leaders cross the six hands in fervent approval.) Apparently cleaning the conference table, the lucky scribe found playing cards scattered representing Ukraine, Canada, Gronelândia, Panama, the moon and Mars. Among others.
Mexico cartels are not forgotten because they are very powerful criminal organizations, not only in their own territory, but also in many other parts of the world, including Europe. The term “cartel” was first used by Florida prosecutors in the early 1980s, during a lawsuit against the Colombian drug trafficking group of Medellin led by Pablo Escobar. This word aims to translate, simplifying, relationships between criminal groups often in conflict. It is part of an organized coexistence between clans, police, military and politicians. In the meshes of this well oil network, powerful interests that go far beyond a fentanil or methamphetamine tablet flourish. Currently, the two most powerful organizations are the Synaloa Cartel and the Jalisco Nueva Generación cartel, which, to abbreviate, uses the acronym (CJG).
These transnational criminal structures are involved in drug production and trafficking, the purchase and sale of weapons, the bleaching of capital, the smuggling of migrants, the exploitation of prostitution and corruption and extortion. Not least, the black market for oil and fuels and minerals such as gold and silver. In the first nine months of 2022, the Mexican state company of oil and gas Pemex lost seven hundred and thirty million dollars due to oil theft through the insertion of illegal taps into the pipelines. The near future also seems quite dark due to the impact of the new and certainly deadly commercial tariffs against Mexico announced by Trump.
In the state of Tabasco, Pemex is developing a bill of $ 1 billion for a new oil and gas field, recently discovered in the Bakté zone, which is expected to be operational this year. It is no coincidence that there are strong tensions among criminal clans in Tabasco. In 2024, this state occupied second place in Mexico in terms of homicides. The Mexican hydrocarbon industry is in crisis due to the exhaustion of important deposits such as Cantarell and Ku-Maloob-Zaap. Recent discoveries are limited and the decline in oil and gas production can lead to serious geopolitical imbalances inside and illegal rows. The Sinaloa clan operates in forty -seven countries. Twenty -five years dedicated to the methamphetamine market and, for thirteen years, also to that of Fentanil.
The cartel matters from Asia from chemical precursors for fentanil production and manufactures tablets in their own laboratories, located in places where it is easier to control the territory. Sinaloa currently lives an internal fracture. The families Zambada and Guzmán (El Chapo) vie for the leadership of the entire cartel. Conflicts and guerrillas are spread over several Mexican states under the control of the same group. In the city of Caborca, in the middle of the Sonora Desert, a war between the Guzmán (Los Chapitos) and the Caborca ​​cartel for control of this key zone for Arizona has been locked. The most profitable markets for methamphetamine are in Asia and Oceania, led by Thailand, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Profits can be a hundred times higher than those obtained with sales in the United States.
Trade with China is also important, extended by Mexicans to a fish, Totoaba, mainly fish in the Gulf of Mexico, from which the dry bladder is extracted, very important in traditional Chinese medicine. Links between China and Mexico are ensured by various ports, including Mazatlán, entirely under the control of the Sinalo Cartel, which also gives the use of port of scale to other criminal organizations for payment. Equally important is the Port of Manzanillo, in the state of Colima, where they operate several cartels, including the Sinaloa cartel, although the surrounding territory is not under its control. However, most of the drug and fentanyl movement from Asia is performed by land or air. The Arizona border is almost fully under the control of the Syinal Cartel. The border posts of San Luis, Rio Colorado and Nogales are functional for drug trafficking, but also key centers for fentanyl smuggling in brand tablets especially intended to spray the Los Angeles zone.
San Ysidro's bustling border post is an open intersection for the Synaloa cartel. A vast network of tunnels facilitates crossing the border between the United States and Mexico. Underground tunnels exploit sewage and water systems from border cities. Sometimes calls between houses in Mexico and US companies are excavated so that goods can be unloaded and charged without being seen. The use of drones or the launch of catapults are rare events, but highlighted in the press because they are scenic. The CJNG cartel expanded as a franchising business. Its leaders are linked to each other by marriage or direct blood ties. After the Sinaloa cartel, he is the second largest drug distributor in the United States. The main markets are Japan and Australia.
The “Great America” is the prosperous United States and with few income and wealth disparities, where poverty is minimal. Essential basic needs, such as health care, are a right and not a privilege and are universally available to everyone. A nation with justice and true as the proverbial lady with blindfolded eyes holding a set of scales, where the recovery is administered equally, not just appearance.
A nation that the world admires for the defense of universal democracy and human rights, respecting others. At the same time, infrastructors will be quickly treated by the world community, reinforced by their very effective military capabilities. A nation that promotes and develops cutting -edge technology to improve life everywhere. A nation that is universally respected by its efforts to live in optimal and clean environmental conditions, but does not give in to climate change extremists. And lastly, but not least a nation with military capabilities with which no nation would dream of wanting to get involved. Possible but absolutely unenforceable with Trump.</description><pubDate>2025-05-29 00:07:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Shanghai | Foundation Serralves presents almost a century of Álvaro Siza Vieira</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/xangai-fundacao-serralves-apresenta-quase-um-seculo-de-alvaro-siza-vieira/</link><description>The Foundation of Serralves inaugurates this week, in Shanghai, a major exhibition dedicated to Portuguese architect Álvaro Siza Vieira, with drawings, models, sculptures and objects that reflect several decades of the Pritzker Award work.
Titled Álvaro Siza: The Archive, the exhibition will be evident between June 6 and September 7 at the Power Station of Art, the first Public Museum of Contemporary Art of Continental China and headquarters of the Xangai Biennial.
This is an adaptation of the C.A.S.A. Show, presented in Serralves in 2024, and represents the largest exhibition ever held on the work of Álvaro Siza, according to a note spread by the organization.
Curated by architect António Choupina - in collaboration with Siza Vieira and Carlos Castanheira - the exhibition is jointly organized by the Museum of Serralves and the Power Station of Art, and proposes a chronological reading of the Portuguese architect's work over almost a century, from their childhood designs to the various typologies that define their path.
In all, the exhibited pieces occupy almost a kilometer of extent extent, the organization said. “Set about art, geometry and beauty, this exhibition presents a portrait of Siza as a true contemporary thinker whose practice continues to resort to drawing as a tool to unravel the internal mechanisms of architecture and thought,” reads the statement.
The 91 -year -old Porto architect has some important works in China, developed in collaboration with Carlos Castanheira, including the water building in Huai'an (East), and the Ningbo Museum of Art and Education. The exhibition also marks the 30th anniversary of the Gemination Agreement between the cities of Shanghai and Porto.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 01:02:25</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC presents today documentary “Metamorṗhisis</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/frc-apresenta-hoje-documentario-metamor%e1%b9%97hosis/</link><description>It is presented today at the Rui Cunha Foundation (FRC), from 6.30 pm, the documentary film “Metamorṗosis”, carried out by António Luís Moreira, a project of 2024 which for the first time is shown in Macao. The event is part of the poster of the celebrations “June, Portugal's month in the sgas”, regarding the arrival of June 10-Portugal Day, Camões and the Portuguese Communities.
According to the synopsis of the documentary, quoted in a FRC note, "Metamorṗhosis" is "an thought -provoking documentary that explores the transformation of rural communities through social and environmental changes", and "the film follows the stories of three villages whose lives reflect the wider social mutations of modernity, in the scenario of the" villages of schist, in Portugal. "
Moreover, it is added in the same synopsis that "in the course of history is made known a man who has never abandoned the land where he was born." “Seeing the villages condemned to depopulation, he fought with vision and tenacity by the collective emancipation of the villages through the recovery of the cultural traditions that are faded,” can be read in the description.
Deconstructed standards
"Metamorṗhosis" focuses on "deconstructing conventional social norms, highlighting how personal and collective identities evolve in the midst of mutable realities", and offers "a convincing analysis of rural life, memory and tensions between tradition and modernity."
This documentary movie was present in some national and international competitions, having been winner at the Luleå International Festival-Sweden 2024 (best feature film documentary and best documentary work), the Filmzen International Competition of Chicago-US 2024-2025 (Best Documentary and Best Emerging Director), the Virtual Best Hollywood Film Film Festival 2025 (Best Documentary Movie), and Portugal Indie Film Festival of Cascais 2025 (best documentary).

The Portuguese Bookstore welcomes a new exhibition tomorrow. This is “small worlds in solid state”, by Claudia Falcão, a conservation and restoration specialist who for the first time debuts with a project in the field of fine arts. The show can be seen until June 28th and is integrated into the official poster of the June 10th - Portugal, Camões and the Portuguese Communities celebrations.
According to the exhibition catalog, “small worlds in solid state” appears to the public as a “journey through memories and visual narratives in solid state, images crystallized in small worlds, worlds that result from what surrounds us, worlds we carry, worlds we build, worlds we share”.
Thus, “object photographs will be displayed, in which the image arises influenced by the morphology of stone, its color, textures and imperfections”, with references to the Portuguese sidewalk, which has become “emblematic” in the territory and is “one of the most recognized symbols in Portugal”.
"If the great art invites an immersive experience, the very small requires approximation and a close look at the discovery of what hides in detail. In both cases, there is a sharing of the artist's vision and, at the same time, we are invited to dive into our own unique universe, which is unique," is also described in the same catalog.
Sidewalk Images
This show is born from the Sølid project, described as "Claudia Falcão's first adventure on the creative side of the fine arts after many years across the art, as a conservative-restoration."
It is a “project that mirrors its experiences, its gaze and its aesthetic sensitivity, and naturally underlies concern for the preservation, not only of artistic and cultural heritage, but also of the visual memories, of more personal caress, which it collects”.
In the Portuguese Bookstore, the public can see works whose base is photography and a support made with sidewalk stones, in white limestone. “In this support, photography arises subtly transformed by its own shape, texture and color of the used stone and each piece becomes unique,” ​​is described.
The Sølid project is “entirely dedicated to Macao” and “was born of the desire to celebrate the cultural diversity of this special city and the bonds that unite it to Portugal”. “In a not sleeping city, like Macau, in a city that changes so quickly, crystallizing a moment on a stone turns out to be a symbolic act of honoring the memory of the instant and capturing the time passing voracious,” reads in the same catalog.
At HM, Claudia Falcão also said that Macau "fascinates her for much familiar and for what is different." "As a Portuguese artist, my gaze will always be a look that has this filter of Portuguese, a filter that is feeling and is culture, it does and will always do part of my identity, my way of seeing and feeling the world and expressing myself and I believe this will be very notorious in this exhibition," he said.
“Although we are on the other side of the world, we still find Portugal in Macao, daily, namely in some elements and architectural milestones, such as the sidewalk, which being so Portuguese, is also part of the identity of Macao. In this particular exhibition, taking into account the context of the celebration of June 10, Portugal and Macau emerge through six series of images that celebrate this strong bond, but also their differences and their differences and their differences. Singularities, ”he said.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:54:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Facilities are present at “Pop Mart Macao Citywalk”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/03/instalacoes-marcam-presenca-na-pop-mart-macao-citywalk/</link><description>It will take place next Friday, in various places in the historic center of Macau, the initiative "Pop Mart Macao Citywalk", organized by the Directorate of Macao Tourism Services and Pop Mart, which aims at an interaction of "star-owned star-owned", which gained names such as "Baby Molly", "Crybaby" and "Labubu". Thus, the idea is to allow the population and tourists to take many photographs to these local creations, providing a distinct offer in the area of ​​entertainment and tourism, highlights STD, in a statement.
This initiative will take place during the summer holidays, between June 6 and September 21, a total of 108 days, offering tours with large dolls. The first initiative takes place at 2:30 pm on the 6th in the leisure zone of Rua do Pai Kok, in Taipa, with the presentation of the installation of the large -scale “Labubu” doll with seven meters high. In the remaining days, the characters of “Pop Mart” will be in places like the sidewalk of the Church of S. Lazaro, Luís de Camões Square, Santo Agostinho and Leisure Zone of Rua do Pai Kok, in Taipa.
According to STD, “the highlights to take photographs include, in addition to the installation of 'Labubu', a four -meter 'dimoo' installation hidden in a Macao World Heritage building; a 'Baby Molly' installation with a new style, which is released for the first time; from all over the world ”.
Senate base
The basis of this initiative, called “Pop Station”, will be in the Ritz Building, in Senate Largo, where STD is headquartered. Here will happen several activities related to the facilities of these characters, such as a temporary sales zone of products or places to take photos, namely a large -scale installation so that people can capture images of the “Mega Space Molly Egg Tart”, with reference to the traditional Nata Pastel. There will also be a consumer incentive campaigns, including the promotional campaign related to “Pop Mart Macao Citywalk”, with disclosure on social networks.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 01:34:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Borders | More than 390 thousand visited Macau on the weekend</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/fronteiras-mais-de-390-mil-visitaram-macau-no-fim-de-semana/</link><description>Last weekend, due to the Dragon Boat Day holiday, 390,442 visitors entered Macao, according to data released by the Public Security Police (CPSP), a total that represented an increase of almost 14 percent over the same period last year.

Macao employed nearly 183,600 non-resident workers at the end of this year, an increase of 31,700 since the end of the Zero Covid policy in January 2023, it was announced yesterday. According to data from the Public Security Police (CPSP), released by the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs, the territory had 183,568 workers without resident status.
This number has been an increase of 20.9 percent since January 2023, when the covid zero policy, which was in force for about three years. This month, migrant workers in Macao, including those from mainland China, were less than 152,000, the lowest number since April 2014.
Macao, which as China followed Covid Zero's policy, reopened borders to all foreigners, including non-resident workers, from January 8, 2023, after nearly three years of strict restrictions.
The hotel and restoration sector was the one that has hired the most since January 2023, winning 17,424 non-resident workers, followed by domestic employees (plus 4,780) and casinos (plus 2,895). The hotel and restoration area was precisely the most affected by loss of labor during the pandemic and more than 17,600 non-resident employees since December 2019 has been fired.
Tourism Trailer
The Four welcomed, in the first four months of 2025, 13 million visitors, 12.9 percent than in the same period of 2024 and the second highest value ever for a year start.
The economic crisis created by the pandemic led the unemployment rate to reach 4 percent in the third quarter of 2022, the highest since 2006. Despite the number of non-resident workers, the unemployment rate remained 1.9 percent between February and April.
Macao's economy shot 1.3 percent between January and March, especially due to the “change in the consumption pattern of visitors,” according to the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services. It was the first time that the territory's gross domestic product has shrunk in homologous terms since the end of 2022, when the region began to raise restrictions due to Covid-19 pandemic.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:47:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Broadway | Francis Lui points to possible renewal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/broadway-francis-lui-aponta-para-possivel-renovacao/</link><description>Galaxy president Francis Lui revealed that the group he leads is facing the possibility of renewing the integrated Broadway resort in the future, but for now, the priority remains the construction of the 4th phase of Galaxy Macau, which will have a theme park.
Quoted by the Hong Kong Ming Pao newspaper, the Galaxy leader comments that one of the main challenges that Macau faces is the lack of prices below a thousand patacas per night, reiterating the idea that the market is lacking at least 10,000 rooms for shorter budgets. It is recalled that the group recently opened Capella at Galaxy Macau, which offers 36 luxurious villages.
Francis Lui added that the gap in the market causes the thousands of tourists coming from the interior of China to watch the shows in Macao end up not staying overnight due to the high prices of accommodation, a gap that cannot be collected even with a renewed Broadway that only offers 300 rooms.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:45:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Flu | Collective cases affect 24 children</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/gripe-casos-colectivos-afectam-24-criancas/</link><description>Health services indicated yesterday to have detected two collective influenza cases in schools.

It is the first time since 2020 that these subsidies are updated
 
From September, subsidies attributed to schools with recurring education classes will all be increased by 3 percent. The information was released yesterday through the official bulletin, in the one that is the first increase in this support since 2020, during the pandemic period.
According to the increases decided by the Chief Executive, the allowance attributed to each class of primary education will rise from 899,600 patacas to 926,600 patacas, a difference of 27 thousand patacas.
Regarding general secondary school classes, the value will grow from 1,073,800 patacas to 1,106,000 patacas, an increase of 32,200 patacas. Finally, in complementary secondary education the subsidy will rise from 1,210,600 patacas to 1,246,900 patacas, a difference of 36,300 patacas.
Data from the management of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) in relation to the number of classes are related to the school year 2023/2024 and indicate that this year there were a total of 56 recurring education classes. Among these, three classes were of primary education, while the remaining 53 were fitting in secondary education, although it is not possible to distinguish between general or complementary classes.
Given these data, the updating of subsidies would have an extra cost of primary education of 81,000 patacas, from 2,698,800 patacas to 2,779,800 patacas. As for the 53 classes of secondary education, and assuming that all classes are of general education, since it is the smaller value, the update of the allowance will have an extra cost of at least 1.71 million patacas, from 56,911,400 patacas for 58,911,400 patacas.
Cost of 1.79 million
Based on the calculations presented, the measure will thus have an extra total cost, considering primary and secondary education of 1.79 million patacas.
According to the DSEDJ statistics, in the school year 2024/2025, when the increases were not yet in force, there were five schools to provide recurring teaching classes at different levels: Luso-Chinese official elementary school, Luso-Chinese high school of Luíz Gonzaga Gomes, Millennium School Secondary School Xin Hua, Seong Fan School of the Macao Commercial Association and São João de Brito School. These schools were attended by 976 students, an increase of 10 students compared to the school year 2023/2024.
Applicant education is intended for people who for some reason have not completed their studies and are outside the “normal age of regular education”.
Other updates
In addition to the recurring education, the executive also presents an update of class subsidies in general education. The increase was also 3 percent.
As a consequence of adjustments, in kindergarten each class is subsidized with 1,095,700 patacas, an increase compared to the previous 1,063,800. In primary education the increase is for 1,193,900 patacas, when so far the subsidy was 1,159,100 patacas. In terms of general secondary education, the subsidy rises to 1,438,700 patacas from 1,396,000 patacas and in complementary secondary education grows to 1,631,800 patacas, when it was once 1,584,300 patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:43:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | Recipes with the highest value from the pandemic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/03/jogo-receitas-com-o-valor-mais-alto-desde-a-pandemia/</link><description>May is a month of high time, due to the golden week, and this year was no different with revenues to grow 5 percent over the last year. The fact that there is another weekend day will also have contributed to the above-expected numbers
 
The casinos recorded gross revenues of the game of 21.19 billion in May, the highest value since the pandemic. The data were announced on Sunday by the Directorate of Inspection and Game Coordination (DICJ).
In January 2020, before the pandemic, the revenues were 22.13 billion patacas. After this period, the previous record was established in October last year, when revenues were fixed at 20.79 billion patacas.
The most recent value of 21.19 billion of patacas means a 5 percent increase compared to May last year, when revenues reached 20.19 billion patacas. In monthly terms, the growth of game revenues was 12.4 percent, given that in April the revenues were accounted for 18.86 billion patacas.
In terms of accumulated revenue, in the first five months of this year there was an increase of 1.7 percent compared to the previous year, with a total of 97.71 billion of patacas compared to 96.06 billion recorded between January and May last year. However, the value is still far away from 2019, the pre-pound period and before the junkets campaign, when revenues between January and May were 125.69 billion patacas.
Over and above
After the results were known, the JP Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) investment bank considered that the value of 21.19 billion of patacas “comfortably exceeded the generality of analyst predictions, which predicted a growth of 2 percent compared to May last year.
"It is recalled that the bar was not low, that is, the expectations of analysts had already been adjusted to the rise-from an initial value of 1 percent annually to 2 percent-to reflect the strong golden week and this growth is impressive, given the adversities ongoing," wrote the analysts DS Kim and Selina Li, from JP Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Asia. "This result translates into a recovery rate of 82 percent compared to the pre-covid period, the best rate since the end of pandemic restrictions," he was added.
In turn, Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Seaport Research Partners, explained that this increase is due to the fact that the month had another weekend day, compared to the previous year, when there is a tendency for revenues to be higher. According to the Seport Research Partners report, quoted by the GGR Asia portal, Umansky explained that “compared to the days of the week,” the weekend days generate revenues 20 percent higher. "The Dragon Boat Festival was earlier this year, began on May 31, instead of happening in mid-June, as last year," he added.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 01:21:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Plastic | Cotontes and other objects on the list of restrictions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/03/plastico-cotonetes-e-outros-objectos-na-lista-de-restricoes/</link><description>The government is planning to broaden the restrictions on the importation of plastic products next year, including on the list of cotton products, balloon plastic rods and inflatable plastic sticks (used in concerts).
The measure was announced by the Director of Environmental Protection Services (DSPA), IP Kuong Lam, who added that the executive is working on the administrative regulation that will extend the restrictions on the use of plastic in Macao, with the purpose of entering into force at the beginning of 2026.
The DSPA director has revealed that every year they are imported to Macau 2.4 million packs of plastic rod cotton packs, 100,000 balloon rods and 500,000 inflatable sticks, according to TDM's Macao channel.
IP Kuong Lam spoke on the sidelines of the “Festival to commemorate World Environment Day 2025 among the Great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay, which took place on Saturday at Friendship Square.
The official also stressed the results of restrictions on import and use of other plastic products. It is recalled that in 2019, the executive implemented the collection of a Pataca for each plastic bag. Between 2021 and 2024, the black list of restricted imports began to include boxes and spherovitis containers, straws, beverage agitators and plastic cutlery.
The measures resulted in the annual reduction in the use of 23 million containers and spherovitis packaging, a reduction of 40 million plastic cutlery and less 300,000 plastic cups.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 01:19:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us his wife and daughter (cf. Recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: High there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”).

Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstandings, if they are fortunately fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered a war, the best animals will be beheaded. superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

According to the polls at the mouth of the ballot box, Lee Jae-Myung (Democratic Party) obtained 51.7 percent of the votes, compared to 39.3 percent of his main opponent, conservative Kim Moon-soo (PPP, right), reported the three largest South Korean television broadcasters.
This vote, whose result still needs to be confirmed by the National Electoral Commission, should allow South Korea to recover a leader and political stability, after six months of crisis triggered by the previous head of state, Yoon Suk Yeol.
In early December, Yoon surprisingly stated the martial law and sent the army to take over the control of Parliament, widely dominated by the opposition, in order to silence it. At the time, enough deputies managed to meet to vote for a motion and quickly fail the initiative of the then president, which was classified as a stroke.
Six months followed in deep political chaos, among massive demonstrations, arrest and dismissal of Yoon Suk Yeol, an unprecedented succession of Interinian presidents and other twists, namely judicial.
If his victory is approved, Lee Jae-Myung, a former 61-year-old worker, will have the difficult task of facing the threat represented by the unpredictable North Korean neighbor, while positioning himself between China, South Korea's main commercial partner, and the United States, ally and historical protector.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 01:01:05</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism | Ectaa wants easier visas for Chinese</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/turismo-ectaa-quer-vistos-mais-faceis-para-chineses/</link><description>The leader of the European Confederation of Travel Agency Associations and Tour Operators argued yesterday that the European Union facilitates the entry to Chinese, after China has extended the exemption of visas to over 30 European countries.
"We will continue to knock on the European Commission door to lower the threshold for visitors from outside Europe," said the president of the European Confederation of Travel Agency Associations and Tour Operators (ECTAA). Frank Oostdam spoke in Macao at a press conference when asked about the European response to China's visa exemption policy, which since October 15 covers Portugal.
In late March, the Chinese ambassador in Lisbon Zhao Bentang said in an interview with Lusa that "China has already asked Europe, Portugal, that facilitates the entry to Chinese citizens." But the Dutch Frank Oostdam admitted that “the political climate is not encouraging” and that the current trend is for further restrictions on entering the European Union, giving as an example the Netherlands.
Oostdam spoke hours before the leader of the far right of the Netherlands, Geert Wilders, had removed the party from the government coalition, due to disagreement over immigration, paving the way to early elections. Wilders required a radical reduction in migration, reinforcing border controls, and rejection of all asylum applicants.
“We would like to have as many people travel the world as much as possible, but I'm not that confident,” said Frank Oostdam. "We are very in favor of freedom of circulation, because if people know each other, we will have a better world," said the president of Ectaa.
In the same tone
Before the press conference, also the president of the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT) lamented “there was no same solution from Europe's point of view regarding Chinese tourists”. “We would really like to happen, this is the opinion of ECTAA, this is the position of APAVT. The visas are harmful to mobility and mobility is good for the world,” defended Pedro Costa Ferreira.
In the case of Portugal, the visa exemption for entry to China is in force until December 31, but Frank Oostdam has shown hope that it will be “prolonged for many years”. "From what we hear, the situation seems optimistic. Hopefully yes, because the visa issue is really essential to explore the potential of tourism from Europe to China," said the leader.
"If we do not have [visa exemption], the potential is there, but it will not result in much more tourists," warned the Dutch. Ectaa vice president, Heli Maki-Franti, lamented that the closing of Russia airspace led the airlines to “dramatically reduce” the number of flights to China.
The European Union closed airspace to Russian aircraft after the invasion of Ukraine, and Moscow retaliated with similar prohibitions, making the links between Asia and Europe more expensive. "Many customers are not willing to pay," said Maki-Fanti.
Macau's Director of Tourism Services (STD), Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, said this represents “a clear opportunity” to Chinese carriers, “because they can fly over Russian territory”. The problem, said Heli Maki-Fanti, is that European travelers "do not yet know Chinese airlines." "There is a lot of [promotion work] that these companies could do in the European market," added the Finnish.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:59:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs | China accuses USA of breaking agreement with “extreme suppression” measures</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/tarifas-china-acusa-eua-de-quebrar-acordo-com-medidas-de-supressao-extrema/</link><description>Beijing accused Washington yesterday of violating an agreement reached in May to temporarily reduce customs rates with “extreme suppression” measures, such as restricting semiconductor exports and nullifying visas to Chinese students.
"Geneva's consensus was achieved based on mutual respect and consultation equality. China has implemented it responsibly and in good faith. However, the US implemented unilateral and unfounded restrictions," said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian.
China, who said he had presented a formal protest, urged Washington to "correct his wrong actions" and "respect the harsh consensus." "The use of pressure and coercion is not the correct way to deal with China," said Lin.
Beijing said on Monday, through its Ministry of Commerce, that since the commercial pact was sealed on May 12, Washington has adopted new measures that "seriously undermine" the commitments made, including the suspension of sales of software used in the manufacturer of semiconductors, new controls on the export of chips used in artificial intelligence systems and the recent revocation of visas for Chinese students, a measure that China described as "discriminatory."
Tensions have increased in recent days, with new restrictions imposed by Washington and a fall of about 20 percent in US imports of Chinese products in April.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged last week that negotiations are stopped and said that a call between Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, could break the impasse.
White House Economic Counselor Kevin Hassett said on Sunday that there is still no scheduled conversation between the two leaders, although they expect them to talk about trade next week. Beijing, however, answered yesterday that he has no "any information" about a possible call.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:51:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Visas | Beijing announces that it will continue to extend exemption</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/04/vistos-pequim-anuncia-que-vai-continuar-a-alargar-isencao/</link><description>China said yesterday that it will continue to extend its visa exemption policy to more countries, highlighting the recent inclusion for the first time from Latin American countries, including Brazil.
"We will continue to optimize our entry policies, widen the number of visited countries, and to invite more international friends to try China's quality consumer products, services and consumer offers," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a press conference.
Since June 1, citizens of Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay can enter China without visa up to 30 days, as part of a pilot initiative announced during the last Latin American and Caribbean Community (Celac) community.
With the entry into force, on June 9, of the exemption from a Saudi Arabia citizens, Oman, Kuwait and Barém, the number of countries with access to China with visa exemption will increase to 43. Policy has also encompassed Portugal since last year.
World
This expansion reflects Beijing's commitment to a “high -level opening” and the construction of an “open world economy,” said Lin. The spokesman stressed that entry facilitation measures “are already producing concrete results”: in the first quarter of 2025, more than nine million foreigners entered China, an increase of more than 40 percent, compared to the same period last year.
In addition, more than 18,000 new companies with foreign investment were created in China between January and April, a homologous increase of 12.1 percent, according to official data cited by Lin.
Beijing believes these policies will help boost tourism, reinforce ties with partner countries, and project a modern and accessible image of China after years of border restrictions due to Covid-19 pandemic.</description><pubDate>2025-06-04 00:50:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Timorense “extremely concerned” with language used about China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/03/pr-timorense-extremamente-preocupado-com-linguagem-utilizada-sobre-china/</link><description>Timor-Leste President José Ramos-Horta said yesterday he was “extremely concerned” about the language used in China in Shangri-La dialogue, a discussion platform on security challenges in Asia.
"I came extremely concerned about the language on some countries, but above all from the United States with relations with China," Ramos-Horta told journalists at Dili International Airport after returning earlier than expected from Singapore, where the meeting took place.
"Instead of looking for a softer language, serenity, dialogue, the speech of the Secretary of State for Defense [Pete Hegseth] mentioned China 20 times. Many countries are uncomfortable with that," said the Timorese head of state.
During his intervention in Shangri-La dialogue, Pete Hegseth accused China of preparing “clearly and credibly to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power” in the Asia Pacific region.
Hegseth also denounced the growing number of incidents with Chinese ships in the Southern Sea of ​​China, accusing Beijing of “illegally seizing and militarizing” claimed islands and islets, namely by the Philippines.
China warned the United States on Sunday that “they should not play with the fire” compared to Taiwan and also accused Americans of turning the region into a “gunpowder barrel” by placing guns in the southern sea of ​​China (see page 10).
Still in relation to that subject, José Ramos-Horta pointed out that the US Secretary of State “makes the policy of its president”, but stressed that Donald Trump “does not want war” and wants to resolve the issue of Palestine and Ukraine.
In his intervention Saturday in the Shangri-La dialogue, the Timorese President warned that “weapons are spreading too quickly through the Asia Pacific countries, creating several dangers for the region. The Nobel Peace Nobel Prize said that Timor-Leste is observing this issue with“ growing concern ”and appealed to countries to collaborate and dialogue about security.
Live and die in Gaza
In statements to journalists at the airport, Ramos-Horta also said he had received the invitation to participate in the International Conference for the Solution of the two states in the Middle East, to be held this month in New York.
"It is a very important meeting to discuss the two states, Palestine and Israel, the environment does not favor this forum, of what is seen, but congratulate the secretary general [UN, António Guterres] who in partnership with Saudi Arabia and other countries have decided to make this summit," he said.
The Timorese President said that the reason why he came earlier from Singapore, his return to Timor-Leste was only scheduled for Wednesday, was precisely to make consultations with the Timorese authorities to make a small document that articulates the country's position.
Timor-Leste defends the solution of two states. "A position that the international community has been in 30 or 40 years, with the creation of a Palestinian state that lives peacefully with the borders of 1967 and Israel, with all their right to live without threats to their existence, that the Israelite people can live in tranquility," he said.
The International Conference for the Solution of the two states in the Middle East (Israel and Palestine) will take place from June 17 to 20 at the UN headquarters in New York and will be co-cited by France and Saudi Arabia.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 01:31:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs | Beijing “firmly rejects” Washington's accusations of violation of the agreement</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/03/tarifas-pequim-rejeita-firmemente-acusacoes-de-washington-de-violacao-do-acordo/</link><description>China yesterday rejected the United States accusations that it violated a deal reached last month to reduce customs rights among the two largest economies in the world.
Beijing has not only rejected Washington's accusations this weekend, as the United States accused of, in recent weeks, "constantly provoking new economic and commercial frictions, aggravating the uncertainty and instability of bilateral economic and commercial relations," according to a statement released yesterday by the Chinese trade ministry.
Washington and Beijing agreed to lower their customs rights for 90 days to 30 percent and 10 percent, respectively, and pledged to pursue discussions to reach a trade agreement. "Unsurprisingly, China totally violated its agreement with us," said President Donald Trump, without specifying which actions carried out by Beijing.
Washington "made spurious accusations and unjustifiably accused China of violating consensus, which is totally contrary to facts," the ministry reacted, adding that "Beijing firmly rejects these unjustified accusations."
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said it was "firm in protecting their rights and interests and sincere in the application of consensus."
Washington has been successively introduced a series of discriminatory restrictive measures against China, ”the statement added, citing the control of artificial intelligence chips exports and the revocation of visas for Chinese students in the United States.
"We urged the United States to find a common base with China, immediately correct their rebuke actions and jointly respect the consensus achieved in Geneva's commercial talks," the Chinese Ministry said. Otherwise, "China will continue to resolutely take strong measures to defend its legitimate rights and interests," he added.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 01:30:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Automobiles | Beijing installs companies to cease price war</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/03/automoveis-pequim-insta-empresas-a-cessarem-guerra-de-precos/</link><description>The Chinese government entered the auto companies to stop pricing wars that, according to authorities, threaten the health and sustainable development of industry in the largest automotive market in the world.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technologies (MIIT) warned that these “disordered” competition strategies severely affected the normal functioning of the sector and its profitability, especially in the segment of electric vehicles. "There are no winners in a price war, let alone in the future," said a ministry spokesman, according to the official news agency Xinhua.
The warning follows a new round of discounts launched on May 23 by a major manufacturer - officially unidentified - and followed by industry giants such as BYD, Geely and Chery. Discounts included, in the case of BYD, incentives that reduce the price of its Seagull model to 55,800 yuan.
The Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) has also launched an appeal on Saturday to end price wars, stating that they run their investment in research and development, impair product quality and can even compromise vehicle safety.
In a statement, CAAM warned that this “involving 'type competition” - a term used in China to describe self -destructive dynamics in high competitive pressure sectors - generated panic in the market.
Authorities have announced measures to reinforce market supervision, combat unfair competition practices and promote a “fair and ordained” business environment. Expected actions include random quality inspections, low cost sales restrictions and greater cooperation between regulatory agencies.
MIIT also encouraged companies to improve their innovation capacity, increase the quality of their products and services, and to fulfill their social responsibilities.</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 01:28:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Taiwan | China warns USA to “not play with the fire”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/03/taiwan-china-avisa-eua-para-nao-brincarem-com-o-fogo/</link><description>China warned the United States on Sunday to “not play with fire” compared to Taiwan after the US defense person accused Beijing of preparing the invasion of the island.
"Taiwan's issue is purely internal to China. No foreign country has the right to interfere," the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement, quoted by the Spanish news agency Efe.
Beijing manifested the "firm opposition" and "deep dissatisfaction" in the face of what he considered to be a speech "full of provocations and incitement" by Pete Hegseth on Saturday during the Shangri-La Dialogue Defense Forum, which ended Sunday in Singapore.
Hegseth warned that the Chinese military "rehearsed daily" a possible invasion of Taiwan and alluded to an alleged intention to do so before 2027.
"Let me be clear: any attempt by the [Chinese] communist party to win Taiwan by force will have devastating consequences for Indo-Pacific and the world. ... The threat of China is real. And it can be imminent," he said.
Although in recent years the Chinese Defense Minister participated in the Shangri-La dialogue, where he should have given a speech in which he could respond to Hegseth, Beijing decided not to send Dong Jun this year without explanation, and it was the diplomacy that reacted.
In the statement, the Ministry warned the United States that "should have no illusions regarding the use of Taiwan's question as a bargaining china." He also announced that he presented a formal protest to Washington.
Conflict
Beijing also accused President Donald Trump's administration of fostering the confrontation between blocks and turning the Asia Pacific region “into a gunpowder barrel”. He also accused Washington of placing offensive weapons in the Southern Sea of ​​China, rich in natural resources, a key zone for world trade that Beijing claims in its entirety.
According to the ministry, there are no problems of freedom of navigation in the waters of the Southern Sea of ​​China, where Beijing has territorial disputes with neighboring countries such as Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. China “generates its differences through dialogue and in accordance with the law,” added the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Chinese representation in the Shangri-LA dialogue was led by counterfeit Hu Gangfeng, a member of the University of National Defense, who accused the United States of launching "unfounded accusations" to "sowing problems."</description><pubDate>2025-06-03 01:25:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong inaugurates world mediation center “at the level of the Hague Court”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/hong-kong-inaugura-centro-mundial-de-mediacao-ao-nivel-do-tribunal-de-haia/</link><description>Hong Kong inaugurates Friday the first non-western headquarters of an important world legal organism, the International Organization for Mediation (Iomed), at a time when Beijing seeks to impose itself as an international dispute resolution center.
Hong Kong's head of the government, John Lee, indicated on Tuesday that the institution will have a status “equivalent to that of the International Court” in The Hague, which “will strengthen the city's international position, attract economic benefits and improve the rule of law,” the EFE news agency wrote yesterday.
The leader of the region has stated that the Center will facilitate Hong Kong's commercial and economic cooperation with international partners, especially the countries of the Chinese infrastructure project known as a new silk route, "creating more business opportunities."
In a reaction to the creation of Iomed, China's main diplomatic representative in the neighboring region of Macau stressed yesterday that it will be the first center “specializing in international dispute resolution”.
China's Foreign Ministry Commissioner in Macao, Liu Xianfa, who was speaking at the opening of a Sino-Lusophone Forum at the University of Macao, said that the inauguration reflects Beijing's desire to be "a positive force for the peaceful development of humanity."
Iomed's inauguration ceremony will be attended by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and high representatives from about 60 countries, as well as delegates from about two dozen international organizations, including the United Nations.
Iomed's creation was proposed in 2022 by China and about 20 nations and, after intense negotiations, it was decided that the headquarters would be located in Hong Kong.
The body will be the first intergovernmental international entity dedicated exclusively to the resolution of international disputes through mediation, defending the principles of the United Nations Charter in a context of growing global tensions and challenges to traditional conflict resolution systems.
Master Play
The new institution is born in a context in which mechanisms such as the World Trade Organization Differential Resolution System and international investment arbitration face criticism for long procedures, high costs and inconsistent results.
Sebastián Contin Trillo-Figureoa, Asia-Europe's analyst, told the EFE agency that the creation of Iomed "is a masterful move from China, consolidating his" soft power "[diplomatic and cultural power] strategy without generating open resistance."
The expert pointed out that "this movement demonstrates China's ability to identify and occupy niches in the international system, highlighting an institutional construction similar to the Asian infrastructure investment bank, which reflects a strategic approach to expanding its global influence."
"Geopolitically, the absence of rejection by Western countries reinforces the perception that China has performed an effective diplomatic operation. The apparent US passivity before Chinese leadership in international institutions suggests a lost opportunity to counteract Chinese discourse as moral and civilizational power," he added.
Trillo-Figureoa noted that "in a world of increasing tensions," mediation "may be more significant than several United Nations initiatives, which face ideological and bureaucratic limitations, thus consolidating the role of China as a central actor in global diplomacy."</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 02:19:17</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck at Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection had Camões with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the right place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macao, Camões has been poorly used in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Rui Leão, architect and co-author of “Layering the City” | A four -hand city</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/16/rui-leao-arquitecto-e-co-autor-de-layering-the-city-uma-cidade-a-quatro-maos/</link><description>Architects Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni have accumulated many drawings over the years, which have now been materialized in “Layering the City”, a work that was released last week at the Venice Architecture Biennial. The book results from two lives dedicated to architecture and two doctoral theses defended at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
 
How does the initiative come to publish “Layering the City”, which makes the retrospective of your work a little?
This project is born from a dialogue between my dissertation thesis and Carlotta [Carlotta Bruni] dissertation thesis, who both take different aspects of our contribution as architects to Macao to the city. And therefore, the project of this book is the encounter of these two theses.
The title of the book refers to the idea of ​​a town in layers.
No, what happens is that in the case of our views, my and Carlotta, there is work brought by each one to the project, and which gives a response to the programmed request, what the client asks, to what lives in the alignment plant [of the project], or a series of questions at civic, public space or the right to quality of life. There are a number of social dimensions [to take into account] to make spaces for people, even when they are impossible [in terms] of politics and in the city. It is these layers that go into the projects and that, deep down, are creating opportunities to qualify the life of the city, the person, the street. And this has nothing to do with those who pay, it has to do with the management that the architect makes in the city through the project. It is these layers, the layers, in which the architect is enriching what is the project's offer to the city and creates several micro-projects within this larger project, which qualify the ride, social spaces and public space in a way that was not requested.
Therefore, in a project of architecture always persists the idea of ​​the people and the spaces they inhabit.
In the case of Macau there is this extreme situation where the public space is always the minimum, with a narrow walk, and where everything is resolved. Because there is a lack of more public space profile in the city, this management done by the architect through the project turns out to be a way to compensate for the city, to reconcile people with it, or the opposite.
The cover of the book refers to Fai Chi Kei's public housing project. I assume that they consider the project one of the great milestones of your studio.
Undoubtedly. This was the first large housing building in collective terms, where we had the opportunity to apply ideas that we had developed to the public space, in Praça do Lago, or even in the park next door. All of these projects have a lot of involvement with the public space and this was our first initiative with a housing program. We did a number of super important experiences that allowed us to demonstrate that it was possible to qualify public housing. We produce a series of gardens, packets, air gardens in various floors [from the building]. We were collecting the floors two to two and four to four to create communities inside the building, almost like a Chinese pharmacy that has drawers, social interaction sites since the bottom floor, and so on. All of this has been worked with small public terraces present throughout the project, and in this respect, it is very innovative. It is, in fact, a demonstration that, whether it is a housing building or a museum, it can indeed contribute to the qualification of people's lives. Any [architecture program, in order to order or contract] it serves for the architect to act on the project.
What other projects are in this book?
We have the Barra station and the intermodal zone [related to the light meter]. There are two projects, for us, very important, because they also come to reconfirm the ability to overlap many and many layers. In the case of Barra Station, there is also a public park on top, and the two marginals, the historic and the new. It is an all -glass, transparent project that allows me to be on the side of the slaughterhouse and see the river and boats through the glass. The building turns out to be a kind of octopus that makes ground level connections, with the gardens around the season that connect with the roof. There is a certain complexity, in which almost a new city system is created and there is at the same time a trial overlap of the train, buses and the passing people. The book also has projects that are not yet built.
What was it like to combine the content of your doctoral thesis with that of Carlotta Bruni?
The book consists of texts by some critics about our work. There is a text by Jorge Figueira, for example, and a great interview conducted by Ana Vaz Milheiro [Academic] and then has our texts.
Is there a presence by architect Manuel Vicente in this work?
Manuel Vicente is very present, because some of these projects were made in partnership with him. Therefore, there is a continuity of these first projects for those who came next, already without Manuel Vicente, and who is very polished for us. Deep down, it has to do with what we not only inherited, but what we brought with us from Manuel.
Presenting this work at the Venice Architecture Biennial, and considering that the MSAR is also represented with an exhibition, is it important for your work and visibility of the studio?
Yes. The idea of ​​publication, with Barcelona's Actar Books, has to do with putting the work, and more than that, its message, which is very specific to Macau and our way of working in the international and architects community, and this goes a lot through the Biennial. It was also in Europe that a consensus was built on the level of descriptions [in architecture] for a few centuries, and where there is a discussion, national and international, around the issues of the profession. We want our work to be present, either through the book and through acting Books, in this international community, to be part of the world.
Leaves and layers
“Layering the City” intends to establish with the international community of architects and passionate about the profession a dialogue showing the last years of work and the vision of the LBA - Rui Leão and Carlotta Bruni's architecture and planning. The work is born of the intersection between two doctoral theses of the two architects: “Designing by Increments: Opportunistic Planning as Urban Strategy for Macau” (by Rui Leão) and “Shaping Macau’s Unpurposed Space: Design in Context” (by Carlotta Bruni).
According to a book presentation, "LBA's intellectual contributions are evidenced through the space narratives that integrate complex urban contexts with culturally sensitive design strategies."
The two architects and their team "emphasize the importance of creating spaces that harmonize with their surroundings, while responding to the functional needs of modern urban life." It is therefore a “particularly relevant approach in Macao, where the juxtaposition of the old and the new is a defining characteristic of the city”, it reads.</description><pubDate>2025-05-16 01:04:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Álvaro Barbosa, vice-rector of the University of São José: “Student visa is very limiting”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/alvaro-barbosa-vice-reitor-da-universidade-de-sao-jose-visto-de-estudante-e-muito-limitativo/</link><description>The University of São José continues the negotiation saga with the Chinese authorities to recruit students from the interior of China. Vice-rector Álvaro Barbosa expects, soon, the increase in master's students from 30 to 200. Regarding the internationalization of higher education, the official advocates changes in student visas to facilitate recruitment
 
Does the recruitment of students from the interior of China remain a matter pending to the University of Saint Joseph?
It is a process that is underway. We have had huge support from the Macao government in negotiations to obtain the quota for our university, and they have been tireless in the effort to try to resolve the issues raised by the central government. Many of the questions are legitimate and concern concerns that arise. We were granted a temporary quota of 30 students for masters ago over a probative period, which served to evaluate how we, as Western University, would host students from China. From China, there is this concern with the host of students in Macau. I think we have made a huge effort and the students who are there, included in this contingent, are quite satisfied.
Is this quota for masters just?
Yes. For a degree we do not have authorization yet. In this way, we are currently at the time we try to overcome this probative period in order to obtain a quota of about 200 students for masters. We are in the final phase of the evaluation process and everything has been doing well. We will have the possibility that, next academic year, expand this quota. That would be great, because for our university, to have a greater impact of our mission in Macao, it is essential to have access to students from mainland China. We cannot be a university in an integrated region in a country like China, and not contact with students from China.
Is it more difficult for USJ to compete with other universities, such as those of Hong Kong, by foreign students, outside China?
The issue of recruitment of international students has become a priority for Macao universities. In the last two or three years, it has become evident that this internationalization is very important. What difficulty is there? There is the issue related to student visas, as these visas currently do not allow students to do any kind of work, denying them that minimum local subsistence mechanism to be able to meet expenses. Nor is it contemplated the possibility of, when the student concludes his formation, to be in the territory and find work. What all countries and regions that are competitive in higher education do, such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Australia, is to have incentive policies. Allow students to work part -time, for example. In Hong Kong when a degree ends, the student can stay in the territory up to a maximum of two years to find a job. This kind of measures do not yet exist in Macau, but I think the government is pondering this possibility. From the moment the decision was made that the internationalization of higher education was important, this must be accompanied with the corresponding measures. The current student visa is extremely limiting and does not encourage the coming to Macao to study, only allows coming. This issue was not as present as it is now, but now there is a strategic policy of internationalization.
It is also a matter of survival for local universities.
Yes. Perhaps there is no greater example of a catalyst for the diversification of Macau's economy than higher education. We have ten institutions, 60,000 students in about 700,000 inhabitants. This is the potential of internationalization, to foster diversification.

And also the research that comes out of higher education.
The investigation, the dynamics of the work that is done. There are a number of vectors that higher education brings to a region or country, this happened to Portugal, for example, with the policy of doctoral scholarships for students from abroad, which completely changed the dynamics of higher education. Cape Verde developed thanks to the impact of higher education.
Then we need to make the system more flexible in Macau.
I don't know if it's a matter of having a holistic view of strategy. There may be an idea, but then it does not intervene in all the necessary dimensions to achieve a certain goal. But I am very optimistic. I believe this new student policy is a key step to be taken in Macau. The internationalization strategy followed by all these countries and regions I spoke, and were successful in capturing international students, was always the same. No need to invent much. First, one should increase the capacity and notoriety of universities, and then a policy of scholarships, which will enhance a student flow, creating a reference for the territory, so that studying there becomes a habit. After this flow of students for a few years, an image is already created and some scholarships can be removed, which students will continue to choose a particular territory to study in it. Australia has a huge higher education industry, for example, and I think that in Macau we just have to follow the same strategies. We do, at USJ, that a little.
How, in concrete terms?
We offer many scholarships, and in this sense the Diocese of Macao has helped us build this flow of international students that allow us to create this dynamic that we hope will be sustainable by itself in the future. I think the government is also doing this. There have always been scholarships in Macau, attributed mainly by the Macau Foundation, but this measure will be strengthened. Solving the student's visa issue, creating a scholarship incentive system for five to ten years, Macau will have a bright future as an international higher education destination. But we need to invest, continue, and it takes a few years.
USJ created the “Macau Hub” platform, in partnership with the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in 2023. At what stage is this project?
This project has to do with our interest in developing a relationship dynamic of Lusophone countries centered in Lisbon in the area of ​​entrepreneurship, first. This cabinet we have at CCCM is not intended to offer training in Portugal, but we want to do something else. As we are positioned in the Great Bay and with Hengqin, where it is intended to activate a business ecosystem, we want to take advantage of the fact that we have relations with the Lusophone world to activate the access of the startups of Portugal, Brazil and Angola, above all, to the great bay and hengqin. We are trying to create a kind of incubator of transnational companies, in which we support the development of Lusophone businesses that want to settle in the large bay and also the reverse system. Strategically, for a university, it is absolutely fundamental to have a dynamic in the area of ​​entrepreneurship. Currently, more than half of our students do not want to go to the corporate world, but create their own businesses. Just as universities have to have employability solutions, they also have to have them for entrepreneurs, who are increasingly. So a university has to have a business incubator. My vision of the future for higher education goes around: a university, besides having a library and canteen, will also have its own business incubator. I would say that most students of management or economy courses dream of having their own business, especially in China. China is perhaps one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world. The CCCM welcomes this initiative in Portugal, but we also work with the Portuguese Catholic University.
And concrete results, already have it?
We have a number of small initial projects that are starting now, and we also work with many business organizations. We have now negotiated a series of projects, and I think everything will develop very quickly, based on the manifestations of interest we have. We were in Angola in December and we have already aligned a series of initiatives, we also have projects with Brazil and Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:56:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Adelina Moura, teacher and trainer: “The mobile phone is like a Swiss knife”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/adelina-moura-docente-e-formadora-o-telemovel-e-como-um-canivete-suico/</link><description>Graduated in the area of ​​educational technologies, Adelina Moura will lead lectures to parents, students and teachers about the use of digital technologies in classrooms, within the “Letters &amp; Company” festival of the Portuguese Institute of the East. The teacher understands that prohibiting mobile phone in schools is not a solution
 
What are the challenges felt by teachers with the introduction of technologies in the classroom? Can the mobile phone actually be a complement to learning?
Yes. I've been saying this since 2005. The mobile phone can be an excellent learning tool, a means to motivate students and to enrich their learning. We have a kind of Swiss knife here, a very powerful equipment in the hands of the students and there is a school failure, because they do not work and help students enhance this equipment they have. What happens is that students learn in the worst way, in a destructed way, by attempt-rrove. There is a gap, as students are not alerted to the positive potential for mobile phone use. They face their mobile phones as a free time use, spending time on social networks and scrolling, and time consumes. It is essential that teachers are users, in their practices, mobile phones, and for the preparation of classes and other projects, to know how to prepare students. I consider that the school has lost several stages of students' preparation and awareness to use these equipment that lead to classes and with which schools have not spent any money. With the prohibition of bringing the mobile phone to the classroom we did not advance anything in this regard.
During the pandemic period, for example, the use of technologies, with distance learning, was quite enhanced.
But during the pandemic we also burned some steps regarding the use of digital by teachers, because before the pandemic many teachers did not believe or used. They thought it was a fashion and they saw no use in the use of mobile phones and other technologies. With the pandemic the use of these equipment proved that without them the situation of education would have been much worse. In these pandemic years, teachers have become more aware of the technologies that already exist and are available to anyone. With internet access on mobile phone, something that has existed since 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone, the e-learning system is enhanced and then we move to “Mobile Learning”, where you can learn anywhere and anytime with mobile devices. It is this reality that we see a little away from school.
And after the pandemic, how has it been?
I think we will take a few more steps towards digital literacy. With Artificial Intelligence (IA), it seems that we are as in the phase I created my first website in 1999 or email in 1995. We are at the beginning. But it is 30 years of technology where there have been many changes, and technology in fact goes on and if we immediately do not realize what we have available, we and students, we help create a moat that has happened in the past compared to digital. In the face of AI, if we do not look back and do not realize what was not done and should have been at school level, we are wasting time. Only a few years from now will people be alert to AI, and the gap is increasing. Hence it is very important to bet now, in this early stage, in the training of teachers, students and families.
Is there much ignorance of parents, removal from this reality?
We have parents who are from this century. That is, they were born with the existence of computers, internet, saw the appearance of the smartphone. But when they studied, the school did not talk about the potential of digital. So these former students came to society and did not bring this sensitivity to digital, to educate their children. We teachers, when we do digital training, are doing good to society because we are also preparing these young people for the future, because they will be parents and should be aware of educating their children. At school we do not only prepare for the job market, but for personal and family life. Hence teacher education is essential. The invitation I received from IPOR seems to me an excellent holistic view of everything, because the school includes several actors, connecting with society.
How should AI be introduced into the classroom?
We currently watch changes in search engines, in fact. We have search engines created from root to Age Age, for example. The best way to introduce AI into the classroom is to ask students and how they use it, and already resort to this tool. At the beginning of the academic year I always ask students to answer a questionnaire about their digital routines, and then I know more or less their practices. In 2023, when the chatgPT came out, I introduced AI in my classes, and realized that students were using this tool to deceive the teachers. Students have to realize that when using AI, they are falling into a certain trap because they are not learning. It is the law of the lowest effort, equal to the phase in which the internet emerged, when students selected, copied and sent to the teacher. We now have the problem that the answers are in Brazilian Portuguese, for example, and I see soon that AI was used. We have, therefore, to dismantle this action in the heads and face them. I tell them that they are being intellectually dishonest and that they have not read the AI ​​response, for example. Since 2023, I feel that students, in the answers to this questionnaire I do, say they are afraid to use chatgpt because they are afraid of being caught by teachers. That is, it seems to have gained some conscience.
It will give these lectures in a different educational context in Asia, where the use of mobile phone can be earlier. How will you deal with these differences, or do you understand that the problems of using technology in the classroom are transversal?
It is a transverse question. Do we have to wonder if the use of a particular equipment and tool will make us wiser? It seems to me not, because we may have the equipment, but the use we make it varies a lot. I tell my students that they should be ashamed, because they have much easier access to content than in my time, when we truly had to do research and read in physical format. I tell them that with this technology they should all have a grade 20, and that they are wasting resources, being dishonest intellectually, because they sign works that are not theirs and do not read, even, they deliver. One of the works we have with students is to teach them how to make bibliographic references, refer to the sources. But I am an optimistic by nature, and I hope that in a decade, secondary education students who are fathers and mothers will be able to deal with these problems of social networks and increase fraud with their children. It is this “parents school” that the school can help create. We are in a moment with no return of digital, and forbidding is the most comfortable situation, but it is not the best to face reality. We have to use the right words to alert. We have in this time of alerts and consciences, encouraging the critical spirit of our students, which is little today.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. In fact, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Fit F4 World Cup will be in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/09/primeira-taca-do-mundo-de-f4-sera-em-macau/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA), announced on Wednesday afternoon that the 2025 Macao Grand Prix will feature its program with the first edition of the Formula 4 World Cup.
The World Council of Motorsport approved by electronic vote the creation of this Formula 4 World Cup in Macao, along with the return to the Territory of the Regional Formula World Cup, which in 2023 came to occupy the place of Formula 3, and the FIA ​​GT World Cup.
The concept of Formula 4 has been introduced by the FIA ​​for over a decade and has been one of the biggest success stories of motorized training sport, currently there are 13 different national championships within the technical and sports framework of the FIA. This will be the fourth time the discipline runs in Macao, having been a regular presence from 2020 to 2023, and was even “head of poster” in the three years the world was immersed in the pandemic.
The FIA ​​did not say how the pilots will be chosen, just referring in a statement that there will be "a rigorous pilot selection process, with only the most talented young people to be authorized to compete." The International Federation also stressed that the Chinese company “Mintimes, organizer of the F4 Chinese Championship, will be the Single Operator, along with FFSA (Fédération Française du Sport Automobile), responsible for providing technical support to the F4 F4 World Cup”. This means that all competitors will have to use Mygale M21-F4 singleolugar, recently renamed Ligier JS F422.
Paris support
The chairman of the FIA ​​monoligae commission, the Italian Emanuele Pirro, said that “Macau is an essential part of the formation of a young pilot, and we have a duty to protect his legacy and future. There is as few challenges as the Macao Grand Prix that we feel that it was the right time to introduce the F4 Fia World Cup. From F4, which is a little more permissive than a regional formula car, so that when they return to a year or two to the FR world cup, they are prepared to truly show what they are capable. ”
Emanuele Pirro, a former guide race vender and a MSAR test enthusiast, also said that "we are also working hard to ensure that we take this opportunity to inspire and educate young Karting riders in the region. The growth and development potential in China and the Asia Pacific region is huge as we boost participating in motorized sport."
Thinking about Macau
The FIA ​​long statement also states that this initiative “also aims to bring students from Karting de Macao, China and the region in general to watch the event in an observational manner, offering them the opportunity to experience a racing test and to obtain valuable knowledge for the next steps in their careers”.
Without going into detail, the international federation, which did not allow it to decline on the participation of Chinese teams in the regional formula cup last year, says that “this big step will undoubtedly benefit local Macao pilots, which will have access to a complete range of international events - Karting, Formula 4 and Regional Formula - on national soil”.
In a statement of Chong Coc Veng, president of the Macao-China General Automobile Association, he said: “We are happy to see FIA ​​hold a F4 World Cup at the Guide Circuit in Macao, which represents an opportunity for young people in the region to find their way of development from international Karting events to F4 and FR singleoligles, and become world champions in the future.”
The participation of MSar pilots in this race has not yet been officially disclosed, but may be limited in number.</description><pubDate>2025-05-09 00:41:31</pubDate></item><item><title>ESPORTS | First Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup Decided in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/06/esports-primeira-taca-fia-girls-on-track-esports-decidida-em-macau/</link><description>Next June, for the first time in its history, Macau will host the Extraordinary General Meetings and the Conference of the International Automobile Federation (FIA). This event, which will take place at Galaxy International Convention Center, from 10 to 13 June, will be complemented with extra activity: the first edition of the “Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup”
 
The worldwide body that governs motorized sport has announced this new competition of Sim Racing, which is being organized in partnership with the Advanced Simracing Race Simulation Cockpits and the popular SIM Racing Iracing game, will be directed to 16 or older female elements, regardless of the ESports previous experience. To apply, participants must register on the FIA ​​official website. In addition, it is necessary to have an active account in Iracing to compete.
Online qualifications for the competition, whose finals will be held at MSAR, have already started officially. The first phase consists of participants trying to record the fastest return on Iracing's Attack team. This online qualification phase ends on May 6th. After this first stage, the top 10 classifieds will be invited to participate in the Grande Final, which will take place at the Week of Extraordinary General Meetings and the 2025 FIA Conference, scheduled from June 10 to 13. In Macao, participants will compete in a several day -to -day face -to -face final, where the first champion of the “Fia Girls on Track Esports Cup” will be crowned.
"We know that eSports are the future, but for this discipline to grow and truly develop, we need to encourage more girls and women to get involved," said Ciscal Niroshan Pereira, the current chairman of the FIA ​​eSports committee. “We hope this competition will serve as a catalyst, encouraging aspiring pilot to experience our discipline and consider a career in motorized sport.”
According to FIA, the 10 finalists will also have access to a training program on how to deal with social communication and networking opportunities, gaining a valuable view of the motor sport industry.
Grow on all fronts
This is the first time the fia girls on track initiative has been involved in a eSports competition. His best known project was probably the Fia Girls On Track-Rising Stars program, an initiative aimed at promoting car sports with the female audience aged 13 and 18, and supported young women's pilots between 2020 and 2023. It is recalled that only 1.5 percent of the total sports licenses are women.
Burcu çetinkaya, the president of the FIA ​​Women in Motorsport committee, said that “FIA is committed to double participating in motorized sports and creating more opportunities for women and girls. Electronic sports allow us to reach more vast and younger audiences-especially those with discovering or with limited access to traditional motorized sports. The winner - at the event in Macau. ”
FIA's decision to launch a eSports competition exclusively for women also reinforces the body's bet on the digital landscape. Electronic sports are an increasingly important part of the FIA ​​base development program.
Last year, the Federation added an Appendix of ESPORTS (Appendix E) to the International Sports Code, allowing national sports authorities to regulate and manage national and international competitions. The FIA ​​also supported numerous regional eSports events, received a record number of 117 eSports participants in the Motorsport Games and further encouraged adhesion by offering 12 -month subscriptions from IRACING to member clubs.</description><pubDate>2025-05-06 00:31:27</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Project for new track in Zhuhai emerges</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/30/automobilismo-surge-projecto-para-nova-pista-em-zhuhai/</link><description>With a very black cloud to turn to the future of the Zhuhai International Circuit, there is a potential good news for the great bay of motoring: a project for a new permanent circuit in the Chinese city adjacent to the MSAR.
According to Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper, Guangdong's provincial government recently published the document “Measures to promote high quality tourism and accelerate the construction of a strong tourist province”, which proposes, for the first time, the creation of an “industrial circle of culture and tourism of the Great Bay”, offering political support to the integrated development of culture and tourism in the region. With this, the first industrial and tourist complex of motorized sports in the Great Bay may emerge.
The project of the Zhuhai Chaoyue international circuit was recently presented at the Zhuhai Ocean Spring Resort, located in Doumen, not far from the city's airport, with an initial investment of 250 million Renminbis.
According to the first information, the project of this circuit provides for welcoming evidence such as Formula 3 and foster collaborative development between motorized sports sectors, cultural events and exhibition industry. The plan includes the holding of several international tests per year and foresees collaboration with Hong Kong and Macau to connect cities such as Jiangmen and Zhongshan, promoting “Multiple stops” and boosting the innovative development of “Event Economics + Cultural Tourism”.
According to Zhou Jian, China Travel Service (Zhuhai) Executive Director General Ocean Spring Resort Co., the FIA ​​grade certification-will also include a karting track, drift track and an interior space of 2,400 m² for exhibitions and events related to the automobile sector. With more than 50 international events projected annually, the goal is to become a "super IP" that joins running, leisure and tourism under the same concept.
The first phase of the Zhuhai Chaoyue International Circuit project will include international certification professionals, as well as support facilities. This project aims not only to fill “a gap in the high -end motorized sports sector in Zhuhai, but will also promote the modernization of the Great Bay's cultural, sports and tourist industries by conducting international racing and themed cultural events linked to motorsport.”
Uncertainties in the air
Last summer, the company Malay LBS Bina Group BHD announced that it sold its participation in the Zhuhai International Circuit (ZIC) - the first permanent circuit built in the interior of China - by 124.7 million ringits (about 214.15 million patacas). In a statement to Bursa Malaysia Securities BHD, the group reported that their subsidiary, Dragon Hill Corporation Ltd, sold all his participation in Lamdeal Investments Ltd (Lil) to Huafa Urban Operation (HK) Ltd, a well -known real estate operator. Lil Detinha 60 percent of Zhuhai International Circuit Limited (ZICL), circuit operator.
Raised in 1996 in order to receive the first major prize of Formula 1 China - something that never materialized - the ZIC was still the initial engine of motor racing in the country and a reference in Asian motorsport. Since its opening, it has welcomed several international evidence, such as the FIA ​​GT, A1 GP or the Intercontinental Le Mans Series. In recent years, track administration has chosen to organize its own events, abdicating the most costly international evidence.
Despite having received, in the past, auto competitions from MSAR, ZIC has been losing protagonism in local motorized sport, due to high prices, limited availability and reducing sports activity in favor of the most profitable commercial activities. The future of the circuit remains uncertain: it is only known that lease agreements between resident teams and the circuit have been frozen and are not being renewed. The track approval will also be about to expire, requiring a new certification to continue to receive competitions in the future.
However, on the weekend of June 14 and 15, the still only circuit of Zhuhai will host the third race of the Formula 4 China Championship season.</description><pubDate>2025-05-30 01:53:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao's historicals get a GP clearance</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/20/historicos-de-macau-conseguem-apuramento-para-gp/</link><description>The Guangdong International Circuit welcomed, last weekend, the second and decisive double journey of Macao - Macau Road Sport Challenge cars, proof of finding for the most important motor racing of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. In a journey with few celebration reasons for the colors of the sinters, the veterans Jerónimo Badaraco and Rui Valente managed to ensure the qualification.
With a list of 68 subscribers, the grill was divided into two groups, A and B, with all the pilots competing with Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8) models. This year, with only one race scheduled for the Grand Prix Program - due to the inclusion of the FIA ​​Formula 4 World Cup - the number of riders was reduced to 36, which placed a supplementary pressure for both missing races. To complicate, the rain came, changing the turns to teams and riders.
In Group A, where Rui Valente faced a complicated weekend on the track around Zhaoqing, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão failed to qualify, in a series dominated by Hong Kong pilots. In Saturday's race, the podium consisted of Wong Chuck Pan, Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping. On Sunday, these three repeated the feat, but with a new order: Lo Pak Yu, Chan Ka Ping and Wong Chuck Pan.
In difficult atmospheric conditions on Saturday, Rui Valente ended only 25th, due to an error in tuning, improving to 15th on Sunday, with the track dry. A penalty after the second race fired him to the 27th place. Still, the 7th place obtained on the first round was enough to secure a place in the Macao Grand Prix.
On the contrary, Maximiano Mannão, behind the wheel of a Toyota with the colors of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended on 26th and 14th, a result below the finding, but it turns out to be positive given that it was Jove Pilot's debut in these wanderings. Célio Alves Dias, with difficulties in his car since the first race, was 24th and 28th, far from the usual level of this experienced Macaense pilot.
Badaraco with final sprint '
On a weekend, where the lively races were broadcast on live streaming in Group B, Hong Kong riders stood out again. On Sunday, Adrian Chung won, with Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin completing the podium. In the second confrontation, Cheang Kin Sang reached a deserved victory, followed again by Leung Tsz Wa and Tsang Pak Yin.
Jerónimo Badaraco came to this challenging weekend without the assured clearance. A modest qualification and 11th Saturday place maintained the open outcome. However, a solid race on Sunday and an excellent 4th place assured veteran Macanese the much desired place on the grid of the Macao Grand Prix, along with countrymen Cheng Kin San, Leong Keng Hei, Lou Check In and Carson Tang.
Also outside the Grand Prix was Dionísio Albino Pereira, who finished 23rd in Saturday's race, but closed the time more forcefully, cutting the line of goal in 13th place in the second race.
At the end of the races, the competitors provisionally calculated had an extra technical verification, being forced to open engines and gearbox, to verify the legality of these two decisive organs of their vehicles.</description><pubDate>2025-05-20 01:57:43</pubDate></item><item><title>GPM | Carlos Lemos presents volume II of his book in October</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/02/gpm-carlos-lemos-apresenta-volume-ii-do-seu-livro-em-outubro/</link><description>After the success of Volume I, Macaense Carlos Lemos, residing in Toronto since 1974, is prepared to launch, in October, the Macao Grand Prix-Victor H.'s personal collection, 1954-1978, volume II (1967-1978), the second part of a book that intends to honor his father, Victor Hugo Lemos-an enthusiast of the great prize of Macao that Life, collected a vast number of photographs and everything that was related to the car races in Macau since 1954, the date of the first edition of the event.
About the second part of the work, Carlos Lemos explained to HM that it will be “very similar to volume I, but contains more newspaper clippings in English and Chinese of each year, as well as some financial reports of the Grand Prix. It also includes a poster of the Jubilee Year, which I made three limited copies and initialed in Canvas, offering one to the Macau (Apomac) retirees and pensioners association (Apomac) Lusitano, as a sign of thanks for the support provided. ”
Docued with photographs of the time and newspaper articles, there are some of the most emblematic periods of the mashed event, such as the evolution of the guide circuit, the first victim (Arsenio Laurel, 1967), the birth of the Grand Motor Motor Prize and the Guide Race, the arrival of the first factory teams and the first sponsors, the first television broadcast in direct, and the attempted Hong Kong to create his own great prize itself. Also in addition to a new chapter, with "ten pages of another collection of my father, called Motor Racing World, with some copies of 1900, autographed photographs of pilots, leaders and personalities of world motorsport."
After releasing volume I in 2023, the presentation of Volume II is scheduled for October 15 in Macao and on October 17 in the neighboring Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong.
More and bigger
The truth is that sales of the first volume exceeded expectations. "It was really a success," the author acknowledges, because "there are only two dozen copies left, which I kept for myself, for offers and reservations, if someone outside Macau is interested." However, for Carlos Lemos, “the biggest success was to be able to raise more than 41,000 patacas for charity”, intended for the Macau IC2 [I Can Too] institution, which supports people with autism or disability.
For this second volume, with more recent content, the number of copies produced will increase slightly. "The impression of volume I was 500 copies, and I found it a little" tight "to get a satisfactory number to offer friends and certain personalities and entities linked to the Grand Prix. So I had 550 copies this time."
Carlos Lemos further underlines that "Apomac and the Lusitanian Club of Hong Kong promised to support the launch of Volume II, which is very important." The book will have more pages - about a hundred more - and the author confirms: “I've received several reservations!”
Mission (almost) fulfilled
With the publication of the second volume, Carlos Lemos's first major goal will be fulfilled, because "my mission to honor my father is complete with regard to the Macao Grand Prix collection, though not entirely, because my father's biggest dream was to have his name in Guinness World Records."
This is also a curious story, as Victor H. Lemos has applied three times to Guinness World Records, to no avail. "God willing and all goes well, I will try once again, on his behalf, to present a new candidacy for the Guinness Book of Records and perhaps also to Fiva Hall of Fame." FIVE (International Federation of Old Vehicles) is a non -profit world organization dedicated to the protection, preservation and promotion of historical automobile heritage.
“This time, for Guinness World Records, I will submit the application with support documents, such as videos and photographs of the collection and books,” explains the former president of the Macao House in Toronto. "My father wrote only one letter without attaching any document, because in those days there was no ease we have today."
In addition to motoring, Carlos Lemos also reveals that he would like to “publish a book on the collection of matches of matches made in Macao. My father collected labels of matchboxes from around the world - has Portugal, Spain, several countries in Europe, etc. This project depends on the time available and the interest of people”. And we stay here for collections? Maybe not: "I have hundreds too, maybe thousands of old coins - so many that is complicated ... So I won't move (laughs)."</description><pubDate>2025-05-02 06:30:08</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Tourism finding races took place in Zhaoqing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/21/gp-corridas-de-apuramento-de-turismo-decorreram-em-zhaoqing/</link><description>The 2025 edition of the Macao-Macau Road Sport Challenge-Macao Touring Championship-began at the Guangdong International Circuit, with 67 cars divided into two groups, A and B, disputing a total of four races over the weekend. Hong Kong riders again showed their superiority, but there were positive results among Macau pilots
 
In addition to the titles at stake, the competition organized by the General Association Automobile Macau-China (AAMC), which is divided into two events, also serves to assign the thirty-six vacancies available to the most important race of the season: the Macao Grand Prix. As such, this first journey on the circuit of the surroundings of Zhaoqing was particularly tense, with very disputed races between the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8), all equipped this year with the new DMC compound pirelli tires.
In the group it aligned three well -known pilots of the Lusophone community: Rui Valente, Célio Alves Dias and Maximiano Mannão. However, a less achieved qualification left the three in the final part of the starting grid, forcing them to redoubled work in the first race, played on Saturday afternoon. This same race was eventually interrupted with a red flag a few turns from the end, due to an oil stroke on the track. Damon Chan, winner of the competition in 2024, triumphed, followed by Lo Pak Yu and Chan Ka Ping, in a podium entirely composed of Hong Kong pilots. The experienced Rui Valente starred in an excellent recovery race, rising from 29th to 14th position. Maximiano Mannão won three places and finished 22nd, while Célio Alves Dias climbed eight positions, ending at 25th.
In the second race, Rui Valente again printed a strong progress, spinning 5th, but the degradation of the tires prevented him from maintaining the position, ending in 7th. With a scoring system that privileges the top ten classifieds, this result may be decisive for their qualification for the Great Award. In his weekend debuts to the commands of a Maximian Maão Tourism car, whose Toyota boasts the colors and the logo of the historic Macau Racing Team, ended in 15th. Célio Alves Dias, on a complicated weekend, was only 23rd and knows that there is a lot to do if you want to qualify next month. The victory was up to Lo Pak Yu, pressured closely by Wong Chuk Pan and Leong Keng Hei. The best representative in the territory was Lou Check In with a 4th place.
MSAR VICTORY AND TOP-10 to Badaraco
Group B races were also marked by uncertainty and great animation inside the track. Chung Kwok Hei, winner in 2023, led the race until a hole forced him to leave. Cheng Kin Sang, representative of MSAR, took the opportunity and took the lead. Bayern Yip Wai Hei has released several attacks, all effectively defended by Cheng. However, an apparent accident on the main line, near the end, caused a new red flag interruption. Cheng Kin Sang won, ending ahead of Bayern Yip and Lam Tou.
In the second race, Bayern Yip exceeded Cheng Kin Sang on the second round and took command. Despite the safety car entrance twice, Bayern Yip kept his calm and secured the victory, winning a first and second place in the weekend. Rao Long, who left the eighth position, showed excellent pace and climbed to the 2nd place in the last two laps. Cheng Kin Sang concluded in 3rd place, adding two podiums on the opening day.
Jerónimo Badaraco, the last winner of the ACP Cup, in 1999, had a discreet beginning, ending in 19th Saturday's race. On Sunday, “Noni” showed that he still has a lot to give local motorsport, reaching a precious 10th place. Already Dionísio Albino Pereira completed the first race in 29th position and did not aligned in the second.
The next, final and decisive journey is scheduled for May 16-18, again at the Guangdong International Circuit.</description><pubDate>2025-04-21 23:40:23</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
