The employee filed a complaint against the company in the US after, in his words, he made several alerts about the situation
 
Admittedly, the former bosses of the Junket Sunning (Alvin Chau) and Tak Chun (Levo Chan) groups are already fulfilled the penalties to which they were convicted, but organized crime cases associated with the two companies that operated in the Macao game sector, raising VIP customers, still raise controversy.
This time, an former employee of consultant Ernst &amp; Young (EY), Joe Howie, who put the company in court accusing it of ignoring the warning signs that something was not well in these Junket companies or in associated companies.
Joe Howie, who co-led EY's global excellence center, says that for years he has warned of adherence to standards defined by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, resisting investigations or denying suspending contracts with clients being investigated.
According to Agbrief portal, Howie worked 35 years at EY and, under the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act” legislation, has now complained in a US Federal Court, claiming that the company retaliated against it for alerting the operations of SUNCITY and CHUN TAK. According to the complaint, violations of the US securities and anti -tic conduct laws are concerned.
In the judicial action it is indicated that EY has done for years consulting work and has audited accounts of the two Junket companies also in other Asian markets. The employee says Ey knew he was working with companies linked to the Suncity group, including US people who had major operations in Macao casinos. EY will not have noticed the absence of data provided by these companies to the consultant.
"Despite repeated warnings, EY continued to profit from contracts signed with these high-risk clients," reads the process. Joe Howie was “marginalized and forced to reform in advance, being expelled from society as a form of retaliation,” is referred to.
The Three Families
In the complaint starring Joe Howie, it is also read that five companies listed in the US, and with connections near the local game sector, were associated with “families linked to the Chinese triads, including Stanley Ho descendants”, and the complaint “identifies three families, but by the association and papers they had in companies, allegedly linked to Alvin Chau Empire Junket and Other contact networks, ”reads the news.
The Agbrief portal also writes that in the complaint against EY there are accusations that it has “provided opinions in the poorly qualified audit, failing to report and identify failures in programs against capital laundering or conflicts of interest”.
On the EY side, the reaction was of unresponsiveness, noting that the accusations are not properly substantiated and that they are based on information disclosed by the media, noting that the processes of the groups of Sunctity and Tak Chun were "considered speculative and politically motivated."</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 01:54:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | GrandView Casino-Satellite will close doors tomorrow</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/jogo-casino-satelite-grandview-vai-fechar-portas-amanha/</link><description>GrandView is the first casino-satellite to end since the legal reform that dictated the end of these spaces. According to the SJM concessionaire and DICJ, at least seven residents may be unemployed, while the number of non-resorted workers was not revealed
 
Although satellites are allowed to operate by the end of the year, the GrandView Casino in Taipa will end the doors tomorrow. The announcement was made yesterday by the concessionaire SJM Resorts, through a statement, and directly affects 166 workers. According to the Directorate of Inspection and Coordination of Games (DICJ), seven of these resident workers will be dismissed.
Satellite casinos result from agreements between some independent dealers and companies, which exploit various game spaces. According to the latest changes proposed by the government and approved by the Legislative Assembly, satellite casinos have to be closed by the end of the year. The alternative is now explored by the dealers, a situation that will only be seen with the L'ARC and Ponte 16 casinos.
"Following the general planning of the company and commercial considerations, the GrandView Casino will officially cease operations earlier than expected, at 11:59 pm on Wednesday, July 30, 2025," was justified. “All game tables currently operating on site will be redistributed to other company casinos to continue to serve our estimated customers,” he was added.
The company also communicated customers with cards, deposits or cash discounts accumulated at the GrandView casino that if they are not reimbursed after closing they can go to the Casa Real casino to deal with the situation. "The company will ensure that all customer rights will be properly honored," he was nominated.
Assured jobs
In the statement issued yesterday morning, the company assured that “all local workers”, hired by SJM, who worked at the GrandView Casino will be transferred to other casinos “according to operational needs”. The potential vacancy of dismissal will only affect non-resident workers, although the number has not been disclosed.
The concessionaire also reported that the seven employees of the company that explores the casino and that they will be unemployed can apply for jobs and will have "priority in hiring equal circumstances." "The company is still committed to fulfill its business responsibilities and contribute to the stable development of the Macao game sector in partnership with the local community," he was bound.
Dicj accompanies closure
Minutes after the SJM statement, also the Game Inspection and Coordination Directorate (DICJ) took a position on a much discussed subject in society and far from consensus, mainly due to the impact on indirect jobs, ie business -generated by restaurants, pledge or hotels that survive due to customers of these casinos.
"As for casino-satellite workers, the DICJ will maintain close communication with the direction of services to labor affairs (DSAL), in order to ensure strict compliance with the commitments made by the SJM, namely the proposal previously presented, as regards the remuneration, the perks and working conditions of its 159 workers highlighted in the referred casino satellite," he was informed.
"And at the same time, providing opportunities to change employment to the 7 workers recruited by the casino-satellite itself, in order to ensure their employment continuity," he was stressed. In the statement, the government indicates that the SJM decision resulted from commercial logic, despite admitting that the law was amended and that the satellite casinos become illegal next year.
DICJ also reported that it will send workers to the scene to ensure the "proper treatment of cash and play cards stored in the treasury, unused cash coupons and the exchange of the play cards."</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 01:52:10</pubDate></item><item><title>SJM confirms construction of low -cost hotel on Mountain Island</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/sjm-confirma-construcao-de-hotel-de-baixo-custo-na-ilha-da-montanha/</link><description>The Macau Holdings Game Society (SJM) announced yesterday that it will even build a three -star hotel in Hengqin after having acquired parts of the “Xin de Kou An Shang Wu Zhong Xin” real estate development, through subsidiary SJM Investment Limited.
Confirmation arises after the preliminary announcement made in December last year, and the investment means not only the expansion of the group linked to game and tourism sectors, but also “the strategic acquisition that supports national policy”, namely increasing cooperation between Macau and Hengqin.
The venture has a “strategic proximity to the central sights of the group”, being a ten-minute drive from Grand Lisboa Palace, Cotai, and 30 minutes from the Grand Lisboa Hotel, in the center of the Macao Peninsula. In this way, new opportunities “for operational synergies, infrastructure sharing and promotions between enterprises” are unlocked.
"When it comes to its conclusion, it is expected that the hotel can complement the group's portfolio through efficient capital expansion" given the existence of response needs in the mass segment, as well as "expand market range and generate more revenue flows."
Lifeline
The acquisition value is 424 million Renminbis, excluding taxes, which is an agreed amount “taking into account the market value, estimated at 660 million Renminbis to the property, and 108 million renminbis in conversion-related costs”. The amount will be paid in seven phases.

The Macao Povo Institute Alliance warned the government to the state of various land recovered in the Nam Van area, conducive to the propagation of mosquitoes. The warning was left through the statements of Tong Ho Laam, the association's executive council vowel, and Tam Sio Pang, director of the association, at a time when fourth cases imported from chikungunya fever were recorded.
According to the report presented, Tong and Tam were approached by residents who complain that a long time ago in the “unoccupied land” of that zone there is “stagnant water puddles” and “the growth of herb”, which creates ideal conditions for mosquito reproduction.
In this scenario the associative leaders expect the government to take steps to prevent the proliferation of mosquitoes on the land that is in its possession.
In the article, members of the Association also recall that previously public works awarded the water removal and mapping service of Nam Van land identified as A3, A4 and A9. The works are contractual to take place between June and September. However, Tong Ho Laam and Tam Sio Pang indicate that although the work is being done on A3 land, which in A4 still there is still a lot of standing water.
Regarding the A9 terrain, next to the AIA building, it is indicated that there is also a lot of standing water and high herbs, since the terrain in question is more depth.
Temporary problems
The members of the Association also appeal to the government to make a better use of unoccupied land, with the creation of public parks and other public facilities. In this way, they indicate, these problems would be easily solved or without checking.
Since the beginning of the year, four imported cases of chikungunya fever have been recorded. The most recent two were released on Friday and led health services to appeal to the population to take precautionary measures.
According to health services chikungunya fever is a viral disease, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, especially those of Aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 01:47:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Nick Lei calls for support to relieve impact of inflation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/economia-nick-lei-pede-apoios-para-aliviar-impacto-da-inflacao/</link><description>New consumer card round and greater access to social housing. At months of the elections, these are the requests of the deputy linked to the community of Fujian
 
Deputy Nick Law has asked the government to launch new measures to counteract the impact of inflation on the resident's portfolio. The request is contained in statements made to the Citizen Journal by the legislator linked to the Fujian community, in reaction to news that inflation in June grew 0.25 percent.
The deputy pointed out that the increase in prices directly affects the life of the population, which has less purchasing power. Nick Law also argued that inflation is highly harmful to the population, especially for low -income families and the elderly who depend on social benefits and support, for whom small amounts of money that no longer is available due to increased prices have greater impact.
In this sense, it argues that the executive should launch a new consumer card round, as the government of Ho IAT SENG did between 2020 and 2022, during the pandemic years. With the elections of September 14 approaching, the deputy also argued that Macau should adopt this measure so that people consume more in the territory, rather than moving to the interior of China.
At the same time, the deputy warned the authorities to the impact of the increase in housing incomes. According to Nick Law, official data show that the rise of incomes was one of the factors that made the prices more expensive in Macao. Therefore, it expects the executive to accelerate the process of distribution of houses and consider increasing the subsidy to pay rent in private housing, while households are waiting for access to social housing.
Houses for all
Nick Law has revealed that although the number of social housing supply is increasing, many residents are currently waiting for an apartment, especially at the level of T1 fractions. The deputy said he had received complaints from a resident who has been waiting for almost three years, without his situation resolved.
The legislator also argues that young people have access to temporary housing, which will be built to houses residents of buildings that will be renewed, within the scope of the urban renewal policy.
Despite criticism of prices, Nick Law has praised the government for in recent years to have brought greater transparency to the market by performing frequent inspections to the supply of first -need goods, such as food, but also the price of oil -derived products and gas.
However, the deputy pointed out that price transparency does not solve all consumer anguish, measures and support plans are also needed to respond to pricing.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 01:42:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Shaolin Temple | Religious Statute withdrawn for embezzlement</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/templo-shaolin-retirado-estatuto-religioso-a-abade-por-peculato/</link><description>Chinese authorities yesterday revoked Shi Yongxin's religious status, abbot of the famous Shaolin temple, which is being investigated by alleged financial crimes and maintaining improper relationships in violation of Buddhist precepts.

Justin Ung caught on sites such as the Tin Hau Temple in the mud, or the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, and created illustrations that teach the history of places
 
“Walking Colors: Architectural Hue Archives” is the name of the new exhibition patent at Creative Macau and is available for a free visit from the public, starting on August 6. The show brings together Justin Ung illustration works that went to inspire the sites of religious character classified and protected by UNESCO, either in connection with Catholicism or Buddhism in Macao, China, but not only.
Thus, betting on a their own artistic perspective, with the abundant use of color, illustrations of places such as the temple of heaven, in Beijing, the Tin Hau temple, in the mud, or the sacred family in Barcelona.
According to a note from Creative Macau, it presents color as "one of the most direct languages of architecture and the most vivid memory code of a city." Thus, the name “Walking Colors” given to this show [street colors] promotes this: a proper path through these special places full of history, including a tour of the “architectural corridors of Macao and the cities classified as UNESCO's world heritage”.
Thus, the audience can see "the solemn votes of the temple of the sky, with a heavenly blue enamel in Beijing" as well as "the romantic whispers of the Portuguese tiles in Pastel of Macao." There are, then, in the case of the Holy Family Cathedral, “the welcoming hug of its earthy tones”, as well as, back to Macau, “the pulsating vibration of the Casinos neon lights, where each tone tells the story of cultural encounters”.
Various rereading
In "Walking Colors: Architectural Hue Archives" is proposed "a visual journey through architecture" and a "chromatic decoding of cultures", in which one can follow "The Steps of Color" and make a rereading "of the architectural stories of our world heritage."
In the case of Macao, its historic center has been classified by UNESCO in 2005. Since then places such as the ruins of São Paulo, Senate Largo and adjacent zones are the target of their own protection and preservation taking into account the classification by the international body.
Also in 2005, the Sagrada Familia's atoning temple was classified, integrated into a set of works by Spanish architect António Gaudi, who lived between 1852 and 1926.
The following year would be classified the temple of heaven in the Chinese capital, which is integrated into a set of Taoist temples and considered the largest in the country.

Hours before the negotiations began, representatives from both countries exchanged accusations
 
Thailand and Cambodia agreed with a “immediate and unconditional ceasefire, the Prime Minister of Malaysia announced yesterday after performing peace negotiations. Anwar Ibrahim, who received leaders from both countries, said the ceasefire will start at midnight on Monday, local time.
"Both Cambodia and Thailand have reached a common understanding," said Ibrahim after mediation negotiations in Malaysia. The ambassadors of the United States and China in Malaysia were also present at the meeting in the administrative capital of Malaysia, Putrajaya.
Malaysia holds the rotating presidency of the Southeast Asia Nations Association (Asean), of which Bangkok and Phnom Penh are members, and already intervened as a mediator between the parts on the second day of the difference.
At least 35 people were killed and more than 270,000 displaced by the worst fighting in more than a decade among neighboring countries. The clashes continued in the early hours of Monday, a few hours before the negotiations began. In addition to the physical confrontation, the leaders of both countries also exchanged accusations hours before negotiations that seem to point to the end of the conflict.
The Thai Acting Prime Minister accused Cambodia of lack of "good faith" by leaving for Malaysia. "We don't think Cambodia is acting in good faith, taking into account the actions to solve the problem. They have to show a sincere intention," Phumtham Wechayachai told journalists at the Bangkok airport.
Cambodia also stated that the attacks continued in the early hours of Monday in the temples of Ta Moan Thom and Ta Kraby, over 400 kilometers of Bangkok and Phnom Penh. Cambodian Ministry of Defense spokesman Mlay Socheata said at a press conference that Thailand attacked Cambodian territory between Sunday and yesterday dawn with artillery obuses and fragmentation pumps.
“We underline the need for both parties to exercise the maximum containment and commit to immediate ceasefire, refraining from any action that may harm it,” reads a statement from the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs even before the meeting.
"We have exhorted both parties to cease all hostilities, to return to the negotiation table to restore peace and stability, and to solve different ways and divergences by peaceful means," said the government of Kuala Lumpur.
Attentive powers
United States Diplomacy Chief Marco Rubio urged the two countries to decrease the tensions “immediately” and to agree with a ceasefire in the border dispute. "Both the president [Donald] Trump and I are in contact with our counterparts from each country and we are following the situation very close. We want this conflict to finish as soon as possible," Rubio pointed out on the social network X.
Also the Chinese Foreign Ministry has appealed to peace. "Cambodia and Thailand are nearby neighbors and friends from China. Peace and the good neighborhood are of the common interest of both parties," said Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun at a press conference.
The statements come after the Thai interim prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, quoted China, along with the United States and Malaysia, as one of the countries that "intervened to help" the meeting between Bangcoque and Phnom Penh, in confrontation since last Thursday due to a territorial dispute on the ordinary border.
In addition to Washington, Beijing and Asean, also the UN, European Union, Japan and Russia, among others, appealed to containment and dialogue between the parties.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 02:19:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Praia Grande | Works in the Catholic Center change traffic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/praia-grande-obras-no-centro-catolico-alteram-transito/</link><description>The second phase of works in the sewage system and other facilities next to the Catholic Center, on Avenida da Praia Grande, will compel changes in the arrangement of traffic between Thursday and next August 30, namely between Avenida da Praia Grande and Rua do Campo.

The idea was defended by Tiago Vasconcelos, advisor to Rocha Vieira, at a symposium promoted by the City of Macau. The Major General also agrees with the extent of the forum to Spanish-speaking countries
 
On Tuesday at the City of Macau (UCM), a symposium centered on cooperation in areas of scientific research and higher education between Macau, China and Portuguese-speaking countries, which served to present various academic projects that are being developed at MSAR.
The event was attended by Major General Tiago Vasconcelos, who was the advisor to General Rocha Vieira in the last years of the Portuguese administration of the territory, and defended a broader look at the role that the Macao Forum can take.
In its presentation, which HM had access, it is read that "the importance of the creation of the Macau Forum cannot be underestimated, both from a symbolic and practical point of view," but "it is necessary to be realistic as to what one can expected from such an organization."
Thus, for Tiago Vasconcelos, “the Macao Forum must find its place among other forms of diplomacy”, such as “bilateral relations, in some cases 'strategic partnerships' bilateral, such as Brazil and Portugal”, or “belonging to other forums” or “multilateral organizations such as G20 or BRICS, of which both China and Brazil are members, or the ASEAN Regional Forum, of which Timor-Leste as China are participants. ”
It is for the person responsible for a "variable geometry", where "the belongings of countries to various forums simultaneously can offer opportunities for the" Macao Platform "to broaden its scope."
And here the former advisor of the last Portuguese governor of Macau highlights the importance of the extent of the MSA platform to Spanish -speaking countries, something that has also been defended by the local executive.
Thus, the MSAR can, with the multiplicity of roles and partnerships of the Macao Forum, “reach other Latin-speaking countries, especially Spanish-speaking, given the similarities between Portuguese and Spanish languages, and existing dialogue platforms, such as the Ibero-American conference, which connects Portugal, Spain and most Latin American countries”.
In general terms, the official understands that one should “understand the proper role played by the Macau Forum among the various personalized bilateral and multilateral cooperation formats, as well as the lessons learned from the more than 20 years of history of the Forum”. This “is of paramount importance to ensure the proper level of ambition and the effectiveness of any new forms of cooperation in which Macau can act as a useful platform,” he said.
A promising land
In conclusion, Tiago Vasconcelos said that since the arrival of the early Portuguese to the territory, in the mid -16th century, that "Macau has played a traditional role as a platform between mainland China and the outside world", playing "part of the" Portuguese world "for almost 450 years, naturally integrating its network."
Thus, ties with Portuguese -speaking countries are "a legacy of their history," which "helps Macao to preserve some of their distinctive characteristics, but also play a useful role in supporting Chinese diplomacy, further facilitating China's relations with Portuguese -speaking countries."
For Tiago Vasconcelos, “Macau's prospects are quite promising to continue to play its traditional and very distinctive role as a connecting platform between China and the Portuguese-speaking countries”, taking into account that it begins half of the 50-year transition period present in the Sino-Portuguese joint statement of 1987.
Still in the area of higher education, the Major General pointed out that "despite its dimension, Macau is becoming, if it is no longer, a center of excellence for higher education in China." "Even worldwide, the same can be said about some specific sectors, making Macau a highly attractive destination for very talented students," he added. The official highlighted the role of the four key laboratories of the existing state, namely VLSI (large-scale integrated circuits) analog and mixed signal at the University of Macao (one); The Quality Research Laboratory in Chinese Medicine, between one and the University of Science and Technology of Macao; The Internet of Things Laboratory to Smart Cities, at UM; and also the laboratory for the Lunar and Planetary sciences, of Must.
The seminar where Tiago Vasconcelos participated, entitled “Scientific and Technological Cooperation between China and Portuguese -speaking countries”, also attended representatives of the central government's connection office on the Macau forum, among other academic and business personalities.
According to a press release on the event sent to HM, José Paulo Esperança, vice-rector of the UCM Faculty of Economics, spoke of the importance of financing academic investigations by the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) in Portugal, highlighting “FCT's efforts to promote international cooperation and resolution of common challenges”.
IP KUAI PENG, Vice-Rector of UCM and Director of the Institute of Studies of Portuguese Speaking Countries of the same educational institution, argued that Macau “should be based on cooperation with Portuguese-speaking countries”, as well as “actively expanding exchange in various areas with Spanish-speaking countries, building a deep, and sustainable cooperation ecosystem, continuing to expand the circle of international friends and international friends and draw a new plan for modernization ”in the format followed by China.
In addition, the official believes that the “remains an important high-level outside opening window for the country” should continue to create “an international cooperation model in areas such as high technology, digital economy and standardization of traditional Chinese medicine, contributing to the construction of a technological power of the country and, at the same time, achieving diverse and moderate economic development”.
Think-Tank to Spanish
The UCM Vice Rector believes it can be created in Macau “an interregional Think Tank with the best universities in Portuguese and Spanish countries, focusing on areas such as green energy, biomedicine and digital technology, promoting transionic circulation with technological means and helping developing countries to overcome digital gap”.
Among the participating researchers in the seminar, highlighting Marta Filipa Simões, from the Macao University of Science and Technology, which presented the Sino-Portuguese Cooperation Project in Fungi and Astrobiology Research. The academic suggested “the conduct of various research projects through cooperation between Macau and scientific research institutions in Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Mozambique and Portugal, in order to promote interregional scientific innovation”.
Already André Antunes, from the University of São José, stressed that, currently, "Macao plays an important role as a point of contact in the network of Portuguese-speaking countries", with a very centered cooperation "in the economic area", although, he defended, "the scientific area will become in a new strong point."</description><pubDate>2025-07-24 05:04:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Dengue Fever | Authorities warn of the risk of imported cases</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/22/febre-da-dengue-autoridades-alertam-para-risco-de-casos-importados/</link><description>Macau is facing a “high risk” period of imported cases of dengue fever and chikungunya. The warning was reiterated yesterday at a joint conference on health services and the institute for municipal affairs. Last year's dengue fever cases have been the highest of the last two decades
 
Health Services (SS) and the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) joined yesterday to alert the population to the growing risk of imported cases of dengue fever and chikungunya fever, given that the summer period is synonymous with more travel and travel.
At a press conference, Leong Iek Hou, doctor and head of the SS disease prevention and control center, said that "there was an increase in cases of dengue fever and chikungunya fever in neighboring regions, which is a high risk to Macao." In addition, he added, "we know that we are in the summer time, there is an increase in the number of Macao residents who travel abroad, or tourists traveling to Macao, factors that may increase the risk of disease." Thus, “the risk of cases [fever] in Macau is high,” said the official.
Leong Iek Hams advanced some numbers, having said that until Sunday, 2,285 confirmed fever cases were reported, 2,100 occurred only in Shunde district.
In the case of Macao, between 2013 and 2019 there were “two to three imported cases of chikungunya fever, all from Southeast Asia”, but in recent years it has increased, although there are no serious cases.
Leong Iek Hou also highlighted the fact that, last Friday, Macau registered the first imported case of this year's Chikungunya fever. According to a statement issued by the SS that same day, the patient is a 61 -year -old man, resident and resident in the Cheng I building, on Avenida do Conselheiro Borja.
Between July 8 and 17, the patient moved to Shunde district in Foshan, with the aim of visiting family members. However, they describe the SS, on the morning of the 17th “began to present symptoms such as fever, headaches, muscle and joint aches, among others”, having returned Macao and sought medical treatment at the Conde de São Januário hospital center.
On the 18th, the public health laboratory confirmed the presence of the Chikungunya virus, with a positive result. To date, the patient has kept stable.
Since the beginning of the year and until July 19, the city of Foshan recorded a total of 1,873 confirmed cases of chikungunya fever, of which 1,790 are from Shunde district, focusing mainly on the villages of Lecong, Beijiao, Chenncun. 49 cases occurred in the district of Chancheng, focusing mainly on the sub-district of Shiwanzhen, Zumiao and Zhangcha; While 34 cases were detected in the Nanhai district, focusing mainly on the Guicheng sub-district.
A dengue of the worst
As for dengue fever cases, Leong Iek Hama pointed out that by 2024 the occurrence of this disease "it was relatively more severe when compared to the last 20 years, as 38 cases of dengue were recorded, nine locations."
"This year were registered eight cases imported of dengue fever, being a place," said the SS official. It has been said that it is possible to lock and combat these infections through, for example, the cleaning of stagnant water, which attracts the proliferation of mosquitoes.
“This year we have done more work to eliminate mosquitoes with Jardim Camões,” said Fong Vai Seng, head of the AMI Environmental Hygiene and Licensing Department.
"We can say that we can eliminate mosquitoes that can be carriers of the virus [causer of fevers], avoiding its transmission. In any of the forms we are at the peak of cases, and residents and tourists may be carried to the virus, so we have to be alert. We have done a series of cleaning work to avoid the source of mosquitoes proliferation, and until June [since the year] we have supervised about 7,400 spaces." It was mentioned.
Inspection actions took place in 140 places that are considered “black points” with regard to mosquito proliferation, and between January and June this year, 1,220 chemical elimination actions of these insects that can cause disease were made.
Both entities promise to work side by side in cleaning land. “AMI and SS have a mechanism for monitoring and treatment of hygiene problems in private spaces or unoccupied land. Whenever the ss find that there is danger to public health, or in case of an emergency situation, and whenever it is not possible to contact the landowners, AMI will collaborate on removing containers or zones with stagnant water that may serve as proliferation of Mosquitoes, ”was said at the press conference.
Leong Iek Hou also explained that there are not yet many places in Macao where tests can be done that disapprove of the infection. "There are not many medical institutions that have this type of test available. When clinics or private hospitals want to take the test for dismissing transmissible diseases, these institutions send us blood samples and we do the tests in our public health laboratory for free for various types of fever, given that symptoms are similar."
Hong Kong on Alert
The risk alert of more imported cases of these two types of fever has also arrived in Hong Kong. According to the South China Morning Post newspaper on Thursday, several experts warn of the high risk of infections taking into account the outbreak registered in the city of Foshan, belonging to Guangdong province.
Wong Hoi-Kei, a senior doctor and head of the Guangdong Center for Health Protection, said that "although outbreaks do not occur in popular cities among Hong Kong inhabitants, frequent trips between Guangdong and Hong Kong mean the risk of imported cases is higher."
Also quoted by the same newspaper, doctor Joseph Tsang Kay-Yan, an infectious illness expert, said it is possible that Hong Kong will have imported cases that may lead to sporadic infections, and explained that the two types of fevers have similar symptoms, but with a big difference: with chikungunya fever, patients feel joint pain.
Wong Hoi-Kei said that several cleaning actions are being developed to avoid proliferation of mosquitoes and to inform the population for symptoms. "We have the ability to reduce the risk of an outbreak triggered by imported cases as much as possible," Wong said.
This year alone, and according to data released by SCMP, more than 220,000 cases of chikungunya fever were registered worldwide in 14 locations, including the Taiwan and Singapore regions. The latest cases of this type of fever in Hong Kong had occurred in 2019, with only 11 patients.
According to the SS, the means of transmission and measures to prevent and control chikungunya fever and dengue fever are identical, both transmitted by mosquitoes of “aedes albopictus” species, which usually reproduce in small amounts of stagnant, clean and stopped water. Given the recent passage through Macao do Typhoon Wipha, the authorities yesterday remembered the importance of cleaning these spaces.
Chikungunya fever is a viral disease and has a period of incubation of three to eight days, which can vary between two and 12 days, with fever symptoms and then joint pain in body areas such as wrists, knees, ankles and fingertips. Two to three days later rashes appear. "The whole course of the disease usually lasts five to seven days, being the state of health of most patients considered light," explains the SS.</description><pubDate>2025-07-22 23:51:12</pubDate></item><item><title>War | Historians defend a monument about Vitória against Japanese invasion</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/22/guerra-historiadores-defendem-monumento-sobre-vitoria-contra-invasao-japonesa/</link><description>In a year of celebration of the 80th anniversary of China's victory in the war against Japanese aggression, Macao schools were encouraged by the government to convey these historical episodes to students. In the fervor of the ephemeris, an academic defended the construction of a monument to mark the date. HM has heard historians who enhance the ideas that should be transmitted by the monument
 
2025 is the year in which the 80th anniversary of China's victory is celebrated in the so -called Chinese people's resistance war against Japanese aggression and anti -fascist World War, that is, when China and Hong Kong managed to escape the Japanese occupation. Macao, having Portuguese administration, and for having kept neutral during World War II, was not occupied by the Japanese, although the neutrality status was quite volatile, as historian Helena Lopes showed in the work “Neutrality and Collaboration in South China: Macau During the Second World War”.
In this context, the authorities have encouraged the territory schools to remember the historical episode through various activities with a patriotic nature, while Lin Guangzhi, director of the Institute for Social and Cultural Research of the University of Science and Technology of Macao (Must in the English), argued that a monument of war in Japan with Japan should be created in Macau.
HM invited two historians, experts in this historical period, to comment on what has indeed happened in these years and what main messages should be transmitted if the construction of the monument actually advances.
Alfredo Gomes Dias, professor of the Lisbon Polytechnic Institute and author of the Doctoral Thesis on Macaense Diaspora in World War II and the Foundation of the Popular Republic of China, entitled “The Macaense Diaspora. Macau, Hong Kong, Shanghai (1850-1952)”, argues that the celebration of this historical period is common to several countries. "In the case of China, the end of the Japanese invasion, taking into account the violence of which it has covered, can and should be celebrated generically throughout the Chinese territory," he said.
But considering that Hong Kong had an effective occupation, while Macau dealt with refugee seizures and power games between Portuguese, Chinese, English and Japanese, will make sense to have a monument on the mashes? Alfredo Gomes Dias understands that yes.
“In the case of Macao, the monument is emphasized if he perpetuates the memory that Chinese, Portuguese and Macanese have fought the invasion, especially on the island of Hong Kong, many of them died on the battlefield. In addition, Macau maintained the tradition of being a territory of refuge that housed Chinese and Macanese from Hong Kong.”
Essentially, the researcher understands that "in any of the cities he can be erected," but in the particular case of Macao, it is important that the monument "intends to take into account the specificity of the history of Macao and the diversity of origin of its residents." Moreover, which argues that it should "preserve the memory of all who have joined side by side to oppose Japanese imperialism at this time."
“Ambiguous neutrality”
For Helena Lopes, a particular interest historian in Macao's landscape in World War II, and author of the work on Macao's neutrality during this period, said she did not see "no problem in building a commemorative monument of World War II in Macao."
In the 1930s and 40s of the twentieth century, he recalls, "most of the population was, like today, Chinese," although "a significant number of the population was a refugee, having sought in Macao (such as in other places not occupied in China) shelter of the violence of conflict."
Thus, Helena Lopes, professor of history at contemporary Asia at the University of Cardiff, in Wales, says it is "normal for China to celebrate victory in World War II, as other allied countries do."
Regarding Macao's neutrality, the historian says it was "ambiguous", given that "many opposite sides intersected in the territory during the war."
In these years, "the territory has been deeply linked to networks of resistance and humanitarian aid during the war: it was not isolated from conflict, but it was deeply linked to several of its dynamics identically to other territories in China under foreign dominance (such as foreign concessions of Shanghai or Hong Kong until these territories were completely occupied)."
In this context, he adds Helena Lopes, "it seems natural to celebrate resistance against Japan during the war, where they participated - openly or underground - several people in Macao (Chinese and other nationalities)," he said.
THE ROLE OF HISTORICAL EDUCATION
Territory schools have been "encouraged" by the Directorate of Youth Education and Development Services (DSEDJ) to organize sessions for students and teachers to watch the ceremonies of the "80th anniversary of the Chinese people's victory in the war against Japan and world victory against fascism." According to a press conference organized to announce these initiatives, the celebrations of the 80th anniversary of victory against the Japanese start on September 3 in Beijing, and DSEDJ intends to organize various events in Macao.
Asked about the inclusion of historical celebrations, with a patriotic nature, in local schools, Helena Lopes says “she has no elements to comment on the educational situation in Macao currently”, recalling that in the years of World War II, “schools in Macau were themselves spaces of refuge and resistance to Japanese occupation of China”.
In turn, Alfredo Gomes Dias stresses that “historical education is always an extension of the narrative of national history”, “a reality common to all countries” and not exclusive to Macao.
The DSEDJ press conference for the presentation of commemorative events was attended by the secretary for social and culture affairs, Lam, which has the Pelouro da Education. The ruler said last June that the government's goal is to "promote the great spirit of the War of Resistance" and "inspire patriotic fervor." All activities will be subordinate to the theme: "Remember the story, stroking the memory of the martyrs, caressing peace and creating the future."
One of the highlights of the celebrations will be the memory of the victims of the Nanjing massacre, a celebration scheduled for December 13. Nanjing's massacre took place in 1937, having stepped for a few weeks after the conquest by the Japanese troops of the one who was the capital of the Republic of China. After the conquest, the Japanese troops massacred the population, including children, women and not combatants.
The invasion of China through Japan began in 1931 with the occupation of Manchuria at first. In 1937, Japan expanded the scope of war, seeking the total occupation of China. What began as a conflict located in Asia would eventually be integrated in World War II, from December 1941, with the attacks of Pearl Harbor. Over the course of several years, estimates point out that on the Chinese side between 3.8 million and 10.6 million people died. Peace was reached on December 2, after the United States attacked Japan with the second atomic bomb in Nagasaki.
HM sent questions to Lin Guangzhi, author of the idea of building a monument, but until the closing of this edition was not obtained.</description><pubDate>2025-07-22 05:02:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs: Seven agreements since Trump arrived at the White House</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/tarifas-sete-acordos-desde-que-trump-chegou-a-casa-branca/</link><description>The United States have reached seven bilateral trade agreements since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January and the latest, signed on Sunday with the European Union (EU), is the largest in terms of business volume.
In addition to the EU agreement, the US government has agreed new commercial terms with the United Kingdom, China, Vietnam, Japan, Philippines and Indonesia, while negotiations continue with dozens from other countries, US authorities.
Here is the data from the list of the seven bilateral trade agreements that Trump was able to obtain since January, when he returned to the White House for a second presidential term.
+++ United Kingdom +++
Signed on May 8, it was the first bilateral agreement signed by Trump since the US government announced a new tariff plan.
This agreement establishes the reduction of tariffs on British cars from 25% to 10% - up to 100,000 vehicles per year - and the elimination of steel and aluminum tariffs; Reciprocal permissions for export of beef and agricultural products, as well as reduction of non -tariff barriers and simplification of customs procedures.
+++ China +++
On June 26, after reciprocal threats of tariffs up to 115%, the United States and China have reached an agreement of principle that is still being developed.
Although it keeps high rates-55% for exporting certain Chinese products to the United States-facilitates the export of rare land in China, eliminates mutual retaliation measures and softens controls on Chinese products to the US market.
+++ Vietnam +++
The US and Vietnam agreed on July 2 to increase the vietnamese exports to the US to 20% (with a 40% rate on the products suspected of being Chinese origin). Trump's previous threat was to establish tariffs in the 46%.

++ Japan ++
Japan agrees with a 15% rate on all its exports to the United States compared to the 25% rate with which Trump had threatened. The country was committed to investing $ 550 billion (about 470 billion euros) in the US and opening its markets to sectors such as car, rice and agricultural products.
++ Philippines ++
The US now imposing a 19% rate on Philippine products, less a percentage point than the 20% that had threatened, in exchange for the exemption of tariffs over US products that enter the Philippines. The announcement was made on July 22, after the visit of Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., to the White House.
++ Indonesia ++
On the same date, July 22, and with almost identical content, Trump's agreement with Indonesia establishes 19% rates on exports to the United States and, in parallel, includes aircraft purchase commitments, US agricultural and energy products.
++ European Union ++
On Sunday, July 27, the trade agreement between the United States and the EU was announced, which states that most European exports will be subject to 15% fees - Trump had threatened with 30% - but included tariff exemptions for certain products.
In the agreement, the EU is committed to buying $ 750 billion (about 650 billion euros) in the United States, investing $ 600 billion (about 510 billion euros) in the country and increasing its US military equipment purchases.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 02:33:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Wipha | Macau reached the maximum signal 10 and only lowered to 3 at night</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/21/wipha-macau-chegou-ao-sinal-maximo-10-e-so-baixou-para-3-a-noite/</link><description>Typhoon Wipha's passage through Macao forced the authorities to take sign 10, and a total of 163 occurrences were registered, highlighting, highlighting five people who were injured and had to receive medical treatment. Sign 3 of storm was only lifted last night
 
Typhoon Wipha passed yesterday by Macau without leaving havoc of larger, although he has obliged the authorities of the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) to keep the 10th of storm, the maximum in this type of occurrences, for many hours, between 12:30 and 17h, when it was passed to signal 8. At the time of the closing of this edition, the probability of the tropical signal 3 Between 21h and 23h, synonymous with permission to resume the activities of daily life. Sign 3 was really lifted at 10:30 pm on Sunday.
At 20h was still the blue sign of “Storm Surge”, with expectations of flooding in the low areas of the city between 4am and 8am this Monday.
According to official data, until 7 pm on Sunday the Civil Protection Operations Center recorded 163 occurrences on both the Macao Peninsula and the islands, especially the registration of five typical injuries, which received hospital treatment in both public health facilities and the Kiang Wu Hospital. Only one person will have been retained in the elevator during the passage of the tropical storm.
It is also mentioned the registration of 54 cases in which authorities had to remove broken lamps, falling trees or overthrowing, or construction infrastructure with potential risk. There were also 98 cases of plaster removal, advertising panels, windows or awnings, as well as seven cases where scaffolding or other facilities was required at work-attest, or even overthrown. There was also the registration of a fire.
It is highlighted, of the data of civil protection, the reception of 24 people in the emergency host center of the Institute of Social Action, around 7 pm, and from the opening of these centers 139 people who were not safe were welcomed.
Posts opened at 17h
With regard to transport infrastructures, the SAI VAN PONTE LOWER TABLE was closed at 11am, being open to the circulation of light cars and vehicles from 17h, but by special permission. The upper passage of the same bridge was closed for a long period.
Also from 17h, it was “obtained consensus among the authorities of Macao and Zhuhai” for the reopening of the migration posts of the doors of the siege, Qingmao and the Transfronho Industrial Park Zhuhai-Macau.
Another transport infrastructure ended due to the passage of the Wipha Typhoon, was the HK-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, having been banned at 3:30 am on Sunday.
Macao bridge closed
Another point to be highlighted from the passage of the Wipha Typhoon through the territory, the closing of the new Macau Bridge, the fourth crossing between the Macao peninsula and the mud. It was the first time that this crossing closed doors regarding the passage of a typhoon, but what is certain is that the authorities never clarify whether this bridge would, or not, ended when the occurrence of tropical storms.
In 2023, when the bridge was still being built, Deputy Lei Chan U raised questions to the Executive on this matter. "In the fourth Macau-Taipa bridge, which is currently under construction, will be installed barriers to wind protection in the main line area, to the wind velocity on the bridge board is not higher than the wind velocity on the ground and it is less than the wind speed provided for signal No. 8, enabling uniforming driving with the conditions in the terrestrial areas," he asked.
However, the deputy stressed the existence of “doubts about the possibility of the fourth bridge may be open to vehicle circulation when signal 8 of Typhoon”.
"In response to my written interpellation, the government stated that, before the bridge's entry into operation, the respective regulation should be observed, which will be defined by the Administration. However, according to recent news, the fourth bridge may also be closed to traffic on Typhoon days, for safety reasons, and to be true, in the future, the pressure of traffic between the Macao peninsula and the mud is even more severe," remembered law chan u.
The deputy asked directly whether the bridge would be “open to circulation when signal 8 or higher of typhoon”, and, if negative, “the administration would consider advancing, as soon as possible, with the construction of the fifth connection, in order to satisfy the needs resulting from the constant increase in traffic between Macao and the mud on typhoon days”.
The response of Lam Hin San, director of services for traffic affairs, granted on August 8, 2023, was comprehensive against the deputy's questions: “When the sign of Tropical Storm No. 8 or of higher degree is a sign, the government will adopt, under the law, restrictive precautionary measures, and the residents and tourists remain at home or in safe places”.

CPSP | Intercepted tourists on the bridge
Two tourists were intercepted by agents of the Public Security Police Corps (CPSP) while walking on the noble bridge of Carvalho in full sign 10 of Typhoon. The agents suggested to tourists a trip to a safer place. According to a statement from the Social Communication Office, the CPSP received the complaint at 11:30, having sent the agents to follow the occurrence with the tourists. Tourists were punished with a fine of 50 to 250 patacas for violation of trafficked traffic, a sanction provided for in the road traffic regulation.
Tin Hau | Temple survived the fall of trees
Yesterday afternoon, during the passage of Typhoon Wipha, the trees dropped and the collapse of a platform near the Tin Hau temple, on Fisherman Street, and is also near Macao Water's headquarters. According to a note from the Cultural Institute (IC), the fall of trees did not damage the main structure of the temple, and contacts were made with the temple administrator, confirming that there were no victims. The IC has stated that "it will send, as soon as the safety conditions allow it, employees to inspect and carefully evaluate the state of the Tin Hau temple and will maintain communication with the administrator, with a view to coordinating repair work."
Health | All services return today to normal
Health Services (SS) issued a note yesterday clarifying that all consultation and exam services return to normal today, taking into account the descent of Signal 8 of Storm for signal 3 after Sunday dinner time.
Today, external specialty consultations will be resumed at the Conde de São Januário Hospital Center, namely in radiology and imaging specialties, clinical pathology, hemato-oncology day hospital, differentiated external consultations, endoscopy center and diagnostic room and daytime treatment, among others.
Also from today, centers or health centers, including Covid-19 vaccination services, provide services regularly, while the blood transfusions center maintains their normal blood donation function.
For users who saw the outdoor consultation or blood collection markings at centers and health posts are canceled due to the typhoon, they may present, according to the scheduled time, next Saturday, July 26, at the center or health center of your residence. In addition, affected residents whose markings at the Macao Neighborhood of Macau in Hengqin and the Medical Examination Center for civil servants will be informed of the new marking date, the SS clarifies.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Sao Tome and Prince | Relationship with China is discreet, but strategic</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/14/sao-tome-e-principe-relacao-com-china-e-discreta-mas-estrategica/</link><description>On Saturday, 50 years of the independence of Sao Tome and Principe were celebrated. The future advances to the rhythm of diplomatic relations with other Portuguese speaking countries. For academic Cátia Miriam Costa, the African country and China are strategic partners, despite the description of the relationship between both
 
Researcher Cátia Miriam Costa considers that the relationship between Sao Tome and Principe and China remains discreet, despite being almost celebrating a decade, with a growing strategic interest of Beijing in the position of the archipelago in the South Atlantic.
"Since neither country nor another talks much about the subject, we end up not realizing the depth of the relationship well. But I believe it is not yet a very deep relationship," the researcher at the Center for International Studies of ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon, noted to the Lusa.
The geostrategic position of the archipelago, located in the Gulf of Guinea, feeds, however, the interest of Beijing, namely in the context of the Chinese bet on the expansion of logistics and sea corridors in the South Atlantic.
"Sao Tome, if it is not a very important port in logistical terms, is a relevant port for control, for example, of piracy, threats. Therefore, this position also certainly reflected by Beijing," he explained.
The restoration of formal ties in 2016, after two decades of Taiwan's recognition by Sao Tome, was a “pragmatic” decision of the African country, and a trump card for Beijing Diplomacy, which always maintained “open channels”, even during the period of removal, Cátia Miriam Costa explained.
"The relationship with China is more fruitful because it brings other counterparts," explained the researcher. "It was also for these counterparts that [in 1997] Sao Tome exchanged the Popular Republic of China for Taiwan, because at that time the Popular Republic of China was a developing country. Therefore, it didn't have to offer what Taiwan had, which was perfectly integrated into the international market," he said.
A VOLTE-FACE
In December 2016, Sao Tome officially announced the establishment of relations with the Popular Republic of China, ending the recognition of Taiwan.
The decision caused the immediate cancellation of the scholarships offered by Taiwan to St.-Tome students, many of whom were eventually integrated into the other Chinese universities. China has quickly become one of the main cooperation partners in São Tomé, with promises of investment and support in areas such as education, technical training, agriculture and infrastructure.
The researcher recalled that even before formal relations, Beijing never completely broke with Sao Tome, keeping the country involved in the activities of the Macao Forum, albeit only as an observer, a strategy he considers "typical of Chinese diplomacy." "China does not fully close the doors. It can suspend relationships, but if it is something of national interest, it is usually renegotiated again," he said.
“Limited Results”
Nevertheless, Cátia Miriam Costa acknowledged that the concrete results of cooperation are still limited. “There are more projects in the role than properly ongoing works,” he said, attributing part of the responsibility to the weak institutional capacity of São Tomé, which only recently began to create structures to attract and negotiate foreign investment.
Among the sectors with the potential for the deepening of cooperation, the researcher highlighted the fishing, the marine resources and eventually the cocoa. Oil exploration raises “high risks”, both for technical complexity and environmental limitations.
"China is interested in the region, but it is not because Sao Tome is an attractive market -because it is not -yes, for its location, stability and integration capacity in a broader regional project," he said.
The researcher also stressed Chinese investment in Chinese language teaching in Sao Tome, which also aims to "create a network of people with language dominance, familiar with culture and potentially useful for the future of bilateral relations." "China maintains a strategic interest in the relationship, even if it does not express it with great visibility. And for a country like Sao Tome, any small help can have a significant impact," he concluded.
Reports of four Sao Tomers who followed courses in China
Denise, Lucineidy, Reginaldo, and Aithysa grew up under the sign of an alliance with Taiwan, until life and academic path were redefined by the rupture of diplomatic ties between Sao Tome and Taipei in 2016.
Denise Aragão Fortes still remembers her hand to Tsai Ing-Wen. It was November 2016, the day of Africa in Taiwan was celebrated, and the official was attended at the time.
It is very likely that behind the scenes would already outline the end of diplomacy between Taiwan and Sao Tome and Principe, but for this student of International Relations at the University of Ming Chuan, in Taoyuan, North Taiwanese, the news, who arrived a month after these celebrations, on December 21, was a surprise.
“There was no rumors, nothing,” recalls Lusa Denise, now 29, working in marketing and living in Almada, Portugal.
When the secondary finished, also the bonds between the island and the African nation, agreed in 1997, had just reached the age of adult. There was “very closeness” between the parts, with Taiwanese friendships in the family.
Normality shaken this December 2016. Studying with a scholarship granted by Taipei, Denise and other St.-Tome students in Taiwan was given the option of continuing studies, without financial assistance, or being transferred to China as scholarships. Being at the end of the academic course, Denise remained in Taoyuan. Most, however, changed geography, university and life.
Country “full of opportunities”
Lucineidy Almeida, now 28, saw the arrival in Tianjin, northern China, as "a new restart" in a "country full of opportunities." Attending the second year of biotechnology in Taichung, this native of Santo António had some difficulty in following the degree in Mandarin. A limitation that would eventually surpass, evaluates today, but in China, had the possibility of studying in English pharmaceutical sciences.
He says he learned of the diplomatic break through social networks and, like all students who spoke to Lusa, left criticism of conducting the process, with “many uncertainties”, information given “on time”, “a feeling of disrespect”, and, in the middle, the suspension of the bags.
Two months after the announcement, he landed in Hong Kong, where he treated his visa, although he still unaware of what his final destination. Only upon arrival in Beijing was he told that he went to Tianjin, recalls Lucineidy, living today in Portugal, in Cacém, and working as an English and Portuguese interpreter in the medical field.
Regarding the diplomatic interruption, it notes that "from what was realized at the time", it was "a monetary question": "in the sense that China offered more [to Sao Tomé] than Taiwan at the time could provide."
The São Tome Prime Minister of the time, Patrice Trovoada, considered the unilateral break of relations as “the right”, taking into account the authorities' view of the country's development. "We decided the principle of joining one China and when adhering implies the cut of relations with Taiwan. The international scenario 20 years ago, not the same as today," he added.
But the new political order did not take students to advance in the academic career. Aithysa Ramos, 32, is still in Beijing, where, after leaving Taiwan, she concluded the master's degree in business management.
If this morning of 2016, the story had not taken this course, would probably have been in Taiwan, where he had lived seven years ago. At the time, it now remembers the English education teacher, it was “devastated and angry”: “It was like my second home, I passed [part of] my adolescence, growth phases”.
Reginaldo was in the second year of Business Management at the University of Yuan Ze, Taoyuan, when he stayed to the news. He realized that he “had no power” to change the course of history.
The initial shock, assumes today, was really the cold. Despite admitting "it was" always a process of doubts, "China, where he moved two months after the cut of relationships," it was a surprise for the better. " “Because I was still here, not coming back, I can say yes, it was the best thing that happened,” he says.</description><pubDate>2025-07-14 01:35:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Coloane | Government canceled project of the Museum of Paladers 9 years ago</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/coloane-governo-cancelou-projecto-do-museu-das-palafitas-ha-9-anos/</link><description>Long before the authorities were part of the 85 square kilometers of maritime areas, there was the idea of lifting a stilts museum to consecrate this type of existing housing in Coloane. However, years later, the direction of tourism services says that the project will not even move forward, having been suspended in 2016
 
Between 2016 and 2017, the government planned to raise a museum about Coloane's stalps to tell the story of these peculiar houses of Macao. However, after news was published in the press to convey the inauguration of the project in 2017, the Directorate of Tourism Services (STD) confirmed to HM that no museum will be born. More: not only will it not be built, but the plan was aborted nine years ago.
“Due to the inclusion of the area where stilts are located in the government's urban planning plan for the coloane riverside, Lai Chi Vun shipyards and Navegantes Street, STD ended the 'Museum of the Museum of the Museum of the House' in 2016, and, subsequently, completed the 'Museum of House Project' procedure. Canceled ”, was referred to in the answer.
The cancellation in 2016 is still surprising, given that on June 14 of the same year the Jornal Tribuna de Macao (JTM) reported that the inauguration of the museum would take place in 2017. In this article, statements were cited by the director of STD, Helena de Senna Fernandes, made to the newspaper or Mun, explaining that the “project was in the [conception] phase of design”. They would have been held, including “several consultations to collect opinions from the residents of that area, expecting to improve the proposal of construction”.
According to JTM, the project should “be completed by the end of the year” in 2016, so that the work will be “started early 2017”, and STD expected “that the construction was completed in the same year”.
After the promise, in 2018 there was still “legal fundamentals” to build the Museum in Coloane, as also reported the JTM. The justification given by the STD was that Macau has not yet had the 85 square kilometers of maritime areas under his jurisdiction, something that has been legislated, precisely, since 2018.
A matter of priorities
HM sought to know the state of the designer of the Museum of Palafites following the recent launch of a book on the stalps of Colaane, by Filipe Afonso, coordinator of the degree in Architecture of the University of São José. Now confronted with the official cancellation of the museum project, the official lamented the decision of the authorities.
"The cancellation of the Museum of Slacinas project is not just news about a project that has not advanced, but a starting point to equate Macao's development priorities, the way the heritage is managed and what means for collective memory, in this case of Coloane," he said. In the opinion of the author of “The Colaane Grammar”, “The Plan for the Marginal of Rua dos Navegantes should include proposals for new buildings that use and reinterpret Madeira as the main and essential element of construction”, and the connection of this street with the Lai Chi Vun shipyards, “especially with regard to the sea front, is a unique opportunity to create a coastal corridor that celebrates Colona's seafront history”.
Thus, and “given the richness of context and cancellation of the stilts museum, the focus should be on integrating the memory of these structures into the new plane”, so the existing structures of the shipyards, stilts should be restored, maintaining their original and material characteristics, but adapting them to new uses ”.
Still on the patrimonial value, Filipe Afonso described, in the interview with HM, the proposal to “classify stilts as heritage to give them legal protection”.
"By cataloging existing stilts, the book contributes to preserving the memory of this type of architecture and a broader discussion about its possible protection," he argued, adding that dwellings, many of them left to abandonment, "could be reused for experience tourism, or cultural interpretation centers, valuing local history."
They could also “be transformed into creative and artistic spaces or in fact propose new wood buildings along the waterline, with various uses and that can generate value to the Coloane community, contributing to Macao's cultural and economic diversification”.
Hopes
Filipe Afonso highlights the process of revitalization and recovery of the Lai Chi Vun shipyard zone as a “initiative with immense historical and cultural value, which refers to the rich tradition of the region's shipbuilding”. In fact, the Lai Chi Vun shipyard zone is one of the “six zones” to recover by the government and operators, which also include places such as the pier in the interior port or Avenida Almeida Ribeiro, among others.
In the area of Lai Chi Vun there is already a leisure zone where cultural initiatives have been carried out, with a museum area that tells the history of the Junos construction industry in the territory.
In this sense, Filipe Afonso asks that “the Macao government does not limit the design of these projects to a restricted range of‘ short-listed Companies ””, ie a restricted group of companies.
Also, in his opinion, "Macau has a new generation of talented architects and creative ready to make his contribution." "I believe that through more open ideas contests, these professionals could offer innovative perspectives for the city's urban and cultural challenges. Deleting them from such crucial processes for Macao's urban and cultural development is a waste," he added.
The HM contacted other architects to get reactions to the cancellation of the museum project, but did not get answers.
What the law says
Between the suspension of the project and today a lot has changed. In 2018, Macao began to have the management law of maritime management, which includes 85 square kilometers of area, and whose principles provides for the environmental preservation of spaces like those that stilts are inserted.
The legislation introduced concepts such as “functional maritime zoning” in the sense of delimiting zones “with fundamental and specific maritime functions according to location, natural resources, environmental conditions and exploration and use needs”.
In the list of principles to be complied with, the legislation speaks of something like “protection of the environment of maritime areas”, in order to “protect natural resources and the environment of the sea, realizing the planning of protection and promotion of the marine ecosystem, and the marine protection should be taken into account”.
It should also be “conserving the sustainability of use and development” of these areas, and their use should be done “scientifically”, according to functional maritime zoning ”.
In addition to the concrete legislation that tied the paddle museum in 2016, there was also a direct planning plan to MSAR, something that was implemented in 2022 and also brings new directives for the exploration of maritime zones.
Coloane now has its own UOPG-Operative Planning and Management Unit, where a “rational organization of public infrastructures and collective use equipment” should apply, as well as “appropriate use of soils” in order to create a “coordinated space structure”.
Coloane's UOPG is part of the “ecological conservation zone”, which aims to “protect areas with ecological value” and “contribute to the greater protection of natural resources with ecological value”. Here it will not be allowed “to allocate soils for housing, commercial, industrial, tourist and amusement uses”, reads in the director of the masket.
Coloane's UOPG is also integrated into the “green or open public spaces”, and here should be “maintaining the current use for green spaces and outdoor activities, integrating it [Coloane's UOPG] into the green zone or open public spaces”.
Specifically, Coloane's UOPG should “promote the development of ecotourism and cultural tourism, with the creation of a tours of nature and the 'green and resilient waist', based on the combination of natural resources, namely hills, sea and coastal lines”. It should also “conserve and optimize existing industrial zones, build the 'waist of knowledge - industry - science' and the 'waist of cooperation of a river, two margins' and, simultaneously, rationally plan the housing zones in adequate location, according to the principle of balance between professional and residential functions”, and these points interconnect with the paradise zone, Navigantes Street and Savings Lai chi vun.
The Director Plan also explains that "the predominant use of soils at UOPG Coloane is an ecological conservation zone."</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:11:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Tiles | Residents ask for greater attention to dangers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/azulejos-moradores-pedem-maior-atencao-a-perigos/</link><description>The General Union of Macao Residents Associations (Ugamm) calls for the government more supervision to the works and the quality and safety of tiles installed in housing buildings. This is how the association reacted to the three cases of tile fall in blocks 5, 6 and 7 of the Koi NGA building in Seac Pai Van, two of which took place during the Wipha Typhoon pass, and the third days in the following days.
According to the association, the government has to intensify inspection efforts, due to public safety reasons, because in block 7 there is an outdoor zone with spaces for the use of residents that can be hit by tiles.
Despite the alerts, Leong Hong said the problems with the Koi NGA building are old and that in May the government, in a response to written interpellation, admitted that in seven blocks two eight blocks there were tiles. However, the executive also reported at the time that in three of the blocks were completed the works of recovery of the walls and that in the other blocks the works were underway.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 01:48:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Chikungunya | People's Covenant warns of danger on government land</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/chikungunya-alianca-do-povo-alerta-para-perigo-em-terrenos-do-governo/</link><description>Association members suggest that the land recovered are temporarily used to avoid the current situation with stopped waters and herbs for cutting, conducive to mosquito reproduction
 
The Macao Povo Institute Alliance warned the government to the state of various land recovered in the Nam Van area, conducive to the propagation of mosquitoes. The warning was left through the statements of Tong Ho Laam, the association's executive council vowel, and Tam Sio Pang, director of the association, at a time when fourth cases imported from chikungunya fever were recorded.
According to the report presented, Tong and Tam were approached by residents who complain that a long time ago in the “unoccupied land” of that zone there is “stagnant water puddles” and “the growth of herb”, which creates ideal conditions for mosquito reproduction.
In this scenario the associative leaders expect the government to take steps to prevent the proliferation of mosquitoes on the land that is in its possession.
In the article, members of the Association also recall that previously public works awarded the water removal and mapping service of Nam Van land identified as A3, A4 and A9. The works are contractual to take place between June and September. However, Tong Ho Laam and Tam Sio Pang indicate that although the work is being done on A3 land, which in A4 still there is still a lot of standing water.
Regarding the A9 terrain, next to the AIA building, it is indicated that there is also a lot of standing water and high herbs, since the terrain in question is more depth.
Temporary problems
The members of the Association also appeal to the government to make a better use of unoccupied land, with the creation of public parks and other public facilities. In this way, they indicate, these problems would be easily solved or without checking.
Since the beginning of the year, four imported cases of chikungunya fever have been recorded. The most recent two were released on Friday and led health services to appeal to the population to take precautionary measures.
According to health services chikungunya fever is a viral disease, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, especially those of Aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 01:47:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Real Estate | Association criticizes government for lack of measures</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/imobiliario-associacao-critica-governo-por-falta-de-medidas/</link><description>The president of the General Association of the Macao Real Estate Sector, IP Kin Wa, again warned of the risk of mischief in Macau banks to reach worrying levels, as a result of the real estate market crisis and the closing of satellite casinos. The statements were made in an interview with Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper.
In the opinion of IP, Macao's economic situation is not unique and the negative trend is equally in the interior of China and Hong Kong. However, the associative leader is concerned because he says that in the other two regions the governments took steps to promote the stabilization of real estate markets. At the same time, IP indicates that in Hong Kong the executive sent an entourage to the Middle East to attract real estate investment and qualified frames.
However, the President of the General Association of Macao Real Estate Sector regrets that in the Mand the Executive does not present measures to attract qualified paintings. IP also criticized the fact that the government did not change the seal tax in real estate transactions, which currently varies from 1 to 3 percent, depending on the value of the property. The association's president said this tax is the highest in the great bay.
"Currently, in Macao, just over 100 real estate transactions per month and only 2,000 transactions throughout the year are held. Property prices are descending and it is necessary to save the real estate sector to stabilize consumption and the economy," IP appealed.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 01:45:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Nick Lei calls for support to relieve impact of inflation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/economia-nick-lei-pede-apoios-para-aliviar-impacto-da-inflacao/</link><description>New consumer card round and greater access to social housing. At months of the elections, these are the requests of the deputy linked to the community of Fujian
 
Deputy Nick Law has asked the government to launch new measures to counteract the impact of inflation on the resident's portfolio. The request is contained in statements made to the Citizen Journal by the legislator linked to the Fujian community, in reaction to news that inflation in June grew 0.25 percent.
The deputy pointed out that the increase in prices directly affects the life of the population, which has less purchasing power. Nick Law also argued that inflation is highly harmful to the population, especially for low -income families and the elderly who depend on social benefits and support, for whom small amounts of money that no longer is available due to increased prices have greater impact.
In this sense, it argues that the executive should launch a new consumer card round, as the government of Ho IAT SENG did between 2020 and 2022, during the pandemic years. With the elections of September 14 approaching, the deputy also argued that Macau should adopt this measure so that people consume more in the territory, rather than moving to the interior of China.
At the same time, the deputy warned the authorities to the impact of the increase in housing incomes. According to Nick Law, official data show that the rise of incomes was one of the factors that made the prices more expensive in Macao. Therefore, it expects the executive to accelerate the process of distribution of houses and consider increasing the subsidy to pay rent in private housing, while households are waiting for access to social housing.
Houses for all
Nick Law has revealed that although the number of social housing supply is increasing, many residents are currently waiting for an apartment, especially at the level of T1 fractions. The deputy said he had received complaints from a resident who has been waiting for almost three years, without his situation resolved.
The legislator also argues that young people have access to temporary housing, which will be built to houses residents of buildings that will be renewed, within the scope of the urban renewal policy.
Despite criticism of prices, Nick Law has praised the government for in recent years to have brought greater transparency to the market by performing frequent inspections to the supply of first -need goods, such as food, but also the price of oil -derived products and gas.
However, the deputy pointed out that price transparency does not solve all consumer anguish, measures and support plans are also needed to respond to pricing.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 01:42:28</pubDate></item><item><title>Education | Government prepares manual for overdated</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/educacao-governo-prepara-manual-para-sobredotados/</link><description>The government is working in a school manual to support overdated students.

In response, Kong Chi Meng also emphasizes that since 2009 DSEDJ has been training teachers to identify this type of students: “To reinforce the capacity for identification and support provided by the front line teaching staff and medium and superior management, since 2009, DSEDJ has been systematically organized training courses and learning and exchanges on the education of overdated students, as well as lectures intended for lectures to Parents/in charge of education, with a view to increasing their knowledge about their overdated children and increasing the effectiveness of education, ”was nominated.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 01:40:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Medical Devices | New Law enters into force in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/dispositivos-medicos-nova-lei-entra-em-vigor-em-2026/</link><description>The new “Supervision and Administration Regime of Medical Devices”, which was approved in Hemiciclo on July 14 and published yesterday in an official bulletin, comes into force on July 1 next year.

The data are part of a jointly conducted hengqin representation of the Macao Women's Association and the Institute for Research and Development of the in -depth cooperation zone, quoted by the newspaper or Mun on Saturday.
According to the data presented, in April this year, 27,629 residents of Macau lived or worked in the deepened cooperation zone, which represented an increase of 27.6 percent, compared to April 2024. Among them, the number of people living on Mountain Island totaled 23,106 (plus 11.5 percent to 2024).
The study conducted by the Association, which has been one of the groups advocating the policy to support the in -depth cooperation zone. It also shows that more than 80 percent of residents living or working in Hengqin are “satisfied” with life on the other side of the border.
Based on about 500 questionnaires, 80 percent of respondents showed satisfaction with “entrepreneurship” and “the employment environment” in the in -depth cooperation zone.
Here and there
When asked by the fact that most contributes to moving to Hengqin, 89.31 percent of respondents highlighted the “beautiful atmosphere” of Mountain Island.
The Chinese language publication points only some of the factors studied, and much if it does not indicate the percentage of answers. However, the most criticized aspect of respondents was the lack of infrastructure on the other side of the border and the lack of other facilities.
Among the main criticisms of people living or working in Hengqin also arise the difficulties of transporting certain Macau products from Macau to Hengqin and vice versa due to customs rules.
As part of the conclusions, the survey of various restrictions on the circulation between the two territories and the access of residents in Hengiqn to areas such as health, social security and education is advocated.</description><pubDate>2025-07-28 05:04:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Financial management</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/gestao-financeira/</link><description>An online communication agency of Macau reported that a cybernaut was circulating (whom we will call John) where he said he had a monthly income of 30,000 patacas, but that he was with financial embarrassment because he was single, had bought a house and paid the installments to the bank, had monthly expenses, had no savings and asked how to do to improve his situation.
Many cybernauts responded to this publication, asking the reason for the high expenses, if they were due to careless spending, if they had bad habits, etc. Many of them highlighted that a way to manage money is to “increase income”. John could look for part-time work or change jobs to make more money. Others suggested that if he lives alone and has a free room could rent him. If I rent the room, John may also consider cooking socks with the tenant to reduce food expenses.
Another important principle of financial management is the creation of “savings”, which implies “reducing expenses to the very least”. Therefore, the cybernauts asked John how much he paid to the bank for the provision of the house and if there would be the possibility of renegotiating it. Others suggested that they shop in mainland China to reduce expenses.
Keeping expenses but increasing revenues, John may have a financial surplus, which can apply to daily spending and savings. On the other hand, with the same income and reduced expenses, it can obtain the same result and achieve your desire to save money.
Which of the two options is better? If you reduce expenses but keep the same income, you will only be able to save a little. If you increase income, you will have several sources of revenue and future financial growth will be higher, and you can still create savings to ensure “times of need”. How much do you need to spare to collect “times of need”? Two million? Three million? We will discuss this issue next week.
To achieve prudent financial management, beyond the above advice, John has to consider two questions. First, what is the objective of financial management? Second, what is the financial management model?
The purpose of the financial management of most people is to make them richer. If you are richer means you have more money to spend in the future, then you will have to have expenditure on expenses. To achieve this goal, John must set different temporal goals. For example, increase the performance between 5% and 25% within a year, changing jobs or getting more part-time work, then having your own business within five years, etc.
After getting his goal, John can give himself a gift, such as a two -month trip to Europe, buy a good car, etc. Of course, both traveling and shopping are ways of getting satisfaction through consumption. John can only be truly happy when he reaches his goals. If it only spends money impensely, it will have a brief happiness and will be on its way to the financial disaster and may pay a very high price, so it must be very careful.
Another purpose of financial management is to increase savings to have more resources in the future, increasing their quality of life. For example, having more money to pay the house at full earlier and get a state of “financial semi-freedom”; This method is better than spending in a thoughtless way.
After setting these objectives, the next step is to consider the model to use to measure your financial performance. The average monthly yield in Macao is about 20,000 patacas. John currently earns 30,000, exceeding the average salary. John owns a house. With a monthly yield of 30,000 patacas, your financial level is very good.
After establishing the model and the financial objectives, there are two points to note.  First, the publication did not mention whether or not John was in love. If you want to get married, your home will be subject to the Macao Family Law and the property can be changed. John must think carefully in the way of dealing with this issue. Secondly, the value of the house is high, but if liquidity is low, the performance may vary depending on market fluctuations. The real estate market is currently slow. If most capital is invested in the house and suddenly it is necessary to have available a high amount, there will be a financial problem and John has to be more careful.
Increasing income and reducing expenses, living within our possibilities, and increasing savings are the basic principles of personal financial management; But we must also have objectives and clarify our financial growth. We can only guarantee that our financial situation is consistent with our socio-economic framework, and that we are not demanding more or less of ourselves when we adopt the correct financial standards.
We must also make the appropriate adjustments to our financial goals based on our own circumstances, ensure that we have enough money to cover daily expenses and have plans to precipate future changes, so that we can enjoy the happiness that money gives us.

Much worse, when the government itself owes millions of euros to firefighters. Firefighters are stick to the whole work: they go out of fire, help road accidents where they often have to disembodate victims, help people inside elevators, help in flooding, carry the most varied sick, help pregnant women who have their delivery inside ambulances. They call them the soldiers of peace.
But in the ambulances is the Busis. The government has a millionaire debt to fire brigade corporations of about 20 million euros and only in unique social rate - mandatory for social security - corporations must pay 35 million a year. Most of the ambulances used in the help are from INEM and it is this institute that will have to pay the default.
Firefighters have warned in advance that if the money is not paid that they will no longer use the ambulances of INEM and only use the ambulances of their associations, although an outpatient way out of INEM costs 21 euros to the state while the same service with firefighters ambulance costs 45 euros - more than double. However, the Portuguese Firefighters League has guaranteed that the population will not be left unanswered in emergency because the crews are the same. One of the problems that make the transport of patients more expensive is the chaotic situation that occurs in the country regarding the end of several hospital emergencies all over the country.
Firefighters often have to walk from city to city due to the end of emergencies and the fact that the mileage increase obviously makes transportation more expensive. In fact, because of the emergency crisis, firefighters have worked more in prehospital aid, but the government has not paid what it should. To this, it is defined to be a default. If the government does not pay the 20 million euros concerned, INEM's ambulances may stand still.
The various crises recorded at the Ministry of Health versus INEM have been a chaos, with several personalities to dismiss the minister and INEM workers to claim the dismissal of the president of the institute. With the strike at INEM citizens died for lack of help. Several citizens and babies have died for long help. The helicopters who should already be in the service of INEM or see them. However, the ridicule happened. Inim paid last week 3.5 million euros debt from the prehospital emergency service, the Firefighters League confirmed. This amount is ridiculous. INEM What it says is that, for your part, the whole bureaucratic process is ready, the only thing it needs is that the Ministry of Health transfer to INEM the values so that they can pay. The “only thing”…
Fire League responsible, António Nunes, stressed that this is a “very complicated period of the year” for firefighters, who have to pay for vacation subsidies, in addition to the unique social fee, a monthly charge that has to be paid to social security. All of this seems like a joke with something very serious. Sometimes there is no idea that the 464 fire department associations pay 35 million euros per year and that if the associations do not make the payment on the 20th of each month, they will fail and fail to take certificates of non -debt, which prevents the state's amounts. The seriousness of the situation is very serious if we meet that the fire brigade bodies transport 1.2 million users per year, by mobilization of INEM.
The Portuguese firefighters are in a dead end, simply by the inoperation of the Ministry of Health and its INEM. We are facing an incompetent management of public money that is necessarily intended for those who do everything by saving our lives. By day and night firefighters always respond and risk their lives in the most dangerous and drastic situations. Where is the consideration of the Minister of Health by the Soldiers of Peace? When 20 million euros are left to pay those who are fundamental in the daily life of the country, there is no classification for this way of rule.
The Portuguese firefighters did not deserve to be treated as beggars, a deplorable and shocking fact that we found to happen within those who have the power to manage our money directed to those who should never have any government late payment. Ai, Portugal, Portugal…</description><pubDate>2025-07-28 05:01:52</pubDate></item><item><title>On Bergman's birthday</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/25/no-aniversario-de-bergman/</link><description>The great Swedish film director was born on July 14, 1918 and would mark our lives like no other when looking from the purest angle of intimacy that gives codes of deciphering and initiation, we look at him how to look at mirrors- and no doubt that almost religious, ritual, enigmatic formalism, and how often indecipherable, was the only liturgy known in two generations.
Its legacy in us remains, its aesthetic meaning was more than we could have required in a world where much of this concept was fading in social priorities, but Bergman was a kind of border that we needed to observe as an almost liturgical rhythm. But the fey Bergman would be much more than that, he lived a lot, he would die in 2007 and his bat side never prevents us from giving him sincere gratitude.
And, what can there be so black? His circumstance and the time where he has developed Hitler's great passion, perhaps for family influence or not, is never known, but suppose yes, and as a young muscular at the Berlin Olympics, Bergman rejected until the last moment, just breaking the reality of what the concentration camps were. An unsettling question if we impose on us: should we judge beings moralisticly, or exulted in them the gift of their legacy?
In this case, and openly, the latter seems the fairest and rewarding, that man at his historical moment can propose to abominable things, but when outdated, he can transmute and be an agent of great deeds. The moral being does not coincide with the genius, the talented being can be somewhat amoral and we do not ask you to confessionalism that hurt your creative source, and this is what we should never forget.
It is quite evident that not all who gave their hand to misfortune have dawned transfigured, changed and more human: no! Most followed the course of time and multiplied by reverberating a hallucinating adage that disagreeed with this hive of unhappy parasites, the extreme European right.
Among the Armilated nationalists, cover and sword congregations, hermeneutic delusions, and barefoot cavalry, they never raised anything but the ridiculous malaria that insists on asserting themselves as unnecessary memory. It is dangerous not knowing how to discern the place where beauty lives, and where the civilizing rhythm fades.
It is this summer that the 'wild strawberries' know well as well as all the fruits that are born of natural sap, and in their memorable, fruitful, and legendary legacy, there have to be dozens of other "fruits" where nature itself does not see. There is one beyond land that populates it and goes towards ontological identities, where we know that going to Fatima on foot is much closer than reaching the miracle of its initiation. Manuel de Oliveira walked slightly close to this record but without the translucent and sequential component of the speeches, and far short of the refined image schematization that requires a shine that a standing machine will never know how to return, but we will find in it hidden reflexes of the master of almost perfection.
Politicians are shadows alongside artists, and what they do only to God belongs, where their lack mean nothing alongside their meaning. The shadow of inquisitive pride cannot blame masters who are entitled to flaws as human as the others, but where there is a hiatus that should always be safeguarded, excellence itself. Professor António de Macedo knew well what he was talking about in his almost cinematic homilies about the work of the great filmmaker.

Pope Leo XIV
The letter to Diogneto was preserved in a medieval manuscript. Destroyed on August 24, 1870 by the Prussian Artillery in the bombing of the Strasbourg Library, but preserved for posterity in three sixteenth -century copies. Between parchment, Constantine and warfare offense, there would be reason to scream miracle and catalog it among the sacred relics. Having no authority to do so, it is limited to evoking the background of this group self -portrait painted by a follower of Jesus to use the pagan Diogneto. Prolegomen to all Christian geopolitics. In Trinitarian Analysis. First, "Christians represent in the world what the soul is in the body." Second, “each dwell in their homeland, but as if they were foreigners; They respect and fulfill all the duties of citizens and assume all charges as if they were foreigners; Each foreign region is its homeland, but each homeland is for them foreign land. Third, "they are like pilgrims traveling among corruptible things, but they expect heavenly incorruptibility." Can you imagine something more current?
More subversive than the Ordo Amoris evoked to her by J.D. Vance as the vicar of the Bishop of Mar-Lago, who raised disapproval in the dying Francisco and then Eminence Prevost? A mysterious thread connects the unknown scribe Paleochristist to the chains of dispute around the evangelizing mission. It is to develop to historicize the anthropological and social essence of Homo Catholicus over three parallel clues and intertwined as miracles of divine geometry in the meaning and shape of the church; its relationship with political power and its euro-widening root. Three ways to understand the crisis of the company co -founded by the saints Pedro and Paulo in its two thousand years of history. We have an idea of what is at stake today. Yes, the boat is sinking while the orchestra plays wonderful melodies. PREVOST is called to straighten it. True, "it is no more time for man alone in charge." But Sine Papa nulla Ecclesia. And without church, many sects. Even satanic.
The Vatican, Sistine Chapel, morning of March 9, 2013. The cardinal gentlemen are gathered in pre-competition to trace the profile of Pope Ratzinger's successor. The Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, gives a five-minute-make-up speech about the Mystery of the Moon. Distilled allegory in the early III century in Alexandrian ecclesiology, around the great Origen Exegete (around 183/6-254/5), which reads the Astral Sol-Lua God-Igreja-Mundo. For Bergoglio, he is a manifesto of the evangelizing church, immune to the worldly inclinations of those who want it closed in itself, and for themselves. Daring to shine with its own light. Not reflected by the sun/God to illuminate your earthly mission. Theological narcissism in saying "I sometimes think that Jesus hits inside, because we let Him come out. The self -referential church intends to keep Jesus within itself and does not let him out. The lunar evocation will contribute to the convergence of most cardinals around the Argentine candidate, defeated by Ratzinger in the 2005 Conclave, also thanks to the support of the Jesuit Cardinal Carlo Martini who will denounce the bicentennial delay of the church in relation to the world in favor of the Bavarian theologian.
Friction between Jesuits. The lunar image speaks of the intellectual inspiration that contact with the Hellenistic-Roman tradition inspires the early Christians. Primitive Christianity is philosophical, then dogmatized in theology. It is based on neoplatonic tradition to seek answers to its paradoxes, such as the presence of evil in the world created by God or the deity of Christ in the monotheistic context established by Judaism. What would have been Christianity, what would remain from it without so much hybridization? "True Philosophy", to say with Justino (100-163/7), father of the church. Thought that becomes poetry. In their allegorical symbols the martyrs, witnesses of illicit faith, are recognized. Atheists, for the pagans. Hence the inculturation between Christians and followers of the Greco-Roman pantheon affiliated with worship, not dogma. Among them stand out the worshipers of the Sun Invictus, Helios beloved by Emperor Juliano (331-363), apostate in the Christian tradition.
However, his solar mystique "was no more than Christianity disguised," Hugo Rahner, Jesuit, to whom we owe a profound investigation in the parable of "MySsterium lunae". The Christian tune between the sun and the moon is, in fact, influenced by the deconstruction of Hellenistic-Roman sun worship to assimilate it to the luminous God-Igreja bond. Preparation for the light of Christ. The crossroads between theology and mission versus the dogmatic self -referentiality that still divides the people of God originates in the appreciation of hybridization between Christian practice and pagan cults, because the Christianization of Helios and Selene is the apex of the syncretism of the Patristic Age. Dilution of true faith, prodrome of heresy, according to purists who contract Christianity in immune doctrine.
Thesis to the iteration of dogma, the feverish recitation of the creed. Enrichment of the Christian community for those who instead fertilize themselves 'from the outside'. Rahner said that "Christianity never presented itself as pure and simple doctrine." He was able to perform with perfect security of himself the gesture of appropriating all that was true and good that had been acquired by the Greek spirit, and originally belonged to him as property, even if no one knew it. From Origen to the future Francis, the “Mysterium Lunae” subsidizes the centuries of the papacy. Its rays focus on both theology and the very structure of the church. In the nineteenth century, century of silelabo and Vatican I, apex of doctrinal and geopolitical isolation of the papacy within the leonine walls preached in the twentieth century by Jesuits such as the brothers Hugo and Karl Rahner or Henri de Lubac is anticipated by John Newman, former Anglican and then Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church, for whom the pagans said.

In the report, traveling the miniatures of Portugal of the little ones (traditional houses, monuments and representations of Portuguese-speaking countries, as well as Macau, India, Azores and Madeira, among others), the official highlighted “LudoGogical inspiration” from a visit that has been made by millions of people from all continents.
"We find here a perfect solution between the possibility of fun and learning, in which the Portuguese language is a living way so that new generations can learn to play," he said.
Both the Armillary Sphere, an ancient navigation instrument that the 1910 Republicans included in the new national flag, such as the cross -linked cross of Vasco da Gama and other navigators, were adopted by the Estado Novo to propagate a “Portugal from Minho to Timor”, imperial, pluricontinental, allegedly one and indivisible.
The Cross of Christ, yet, continues to appear on the flag of the Autonomous Region of Madeira, as well as identifying the fleets of the Portuguese Air Force and the Portuguese Navy.
More pedagogy
In recent decades, following the consolidation of the democratic regime born with April 25, 1974, as well as the rise to the independence of the former colonies, the primitive ideological matrix of Portugal of the little ones has giving way to a more multicultural view that privileges the playful and pedagogical components.
“Deep expression of our language, as it is common” to most Member States of the community of Portuguese-speaking countries (CPLP), except Equatorial Guinea, the park is also assumed by the owner, the Bissaya Barreto Foundation, as “expression of intercultural” and tolerance between peoples linked by historical ties, said Nuno Gonçalves, while explaining the functioning of the playful passport that can be carried. Each country, region or territory.
The trip includes, in particular, Brazil, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, Mozambique, Timor-Leste and Azores, Madeira, India and Macau, whose Portuguese administration passed to China in 1999. “This visit includes the trip, the experience, the dynamics and the narrative,” emphasized Nuno Gonçalves.
Immaculate conception
Conceived by architect Cassiano Branco, the park was born at the initiative of Bissaya Barreto, professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Coimbra, in which he studied at the targets of the twentieth century, making friends with António Salazar, then still a young student from the Faculty of Law.
He opened to the public in 1940, a scarce months after the Portuguese exhibition was inaugurated in Lisbon, which pointed out two centuries -old centuries: eight centuries from the foundation of nationality, by Afonso Henriques, and 300 years of the restoration of Portugal's independence by the 1640 conjured, ending 60 years of Philipian dynasty and Spanish rule.
Fifty years after the political emancipation of the old Africa colonies in 1975, when Goa, Damão and Diu, the so -called Portuguese India, had already been attached by the then Indian Union, in 1961, Portugal dos small, among other valences, magnifies with “Galleries inspired by Portuguese -expression countries”, proposing “a visitation experience that is also learning”.
"It is possible to visit Portugal and other countries in a short time and for a very small value, because we do not have to catch the plane," said the director.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 02:05:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Creative Macau | Heritage of UNESCO prominently in Nova Show</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/creative-macau-patrimonio-da-unesco-em-destaque-em-nova-mostra/</link><description>The new exhibition at Creative Macau reveals a fresh perspective on the historical heritage of Macao and China classified by UNESCO.

The show brings together portraits of Luís de Camões taken from the posters that the designer and artist Macanese has been doing for decades to celebrate June 10. The inspiration, about this and other figures from Portugal and its literature, is far from exhausting
 
“Camões, five zero zero” is the exhibition that can be seen until the end of August at the Passavite Gallery in Lisbon, and the first in the individual name of the artist and designer Macanese Vítor Hugo Marreiros. This is not the first total premiere of martyrs on Portuguese soil, taking into account their previous participation in collective exhibitions, but it is the first time it exposes in their own name and soon to show a job that so much visibility has given him in recent times: the June 10 posters with the face of Camões, and not only.
The show “Camões, five zero zero” is, as the name implies, an exhibition dedicated entirely to the poet's images in these posters, but with a new outfit and artistic language.
“Everything came from the challenge proposed by a colleague of mine, Henrique Silva, better known as bibn,” he told HM. "The paintings that are here are not only taken from the posters of June 10, but also from other works, because throughout my professional life I had numerous opportunities to portray Portuguese themes and icons such as Fernando Pessoa, Amália, even Sardinha," he said.
Vítor Hugo Marreiros makes the posters of June 10 - Camões Day, Portugal and the Portuguese communities for 34 years and has always sought to merge the figure of the poet with some themes of the current of the country, as well as the symbols of Portuguese.
"In recent years I have tried to portray the concerns of the Portuguese community [of Macau], as well as events in Portugal, the crisis, covid-19 or the war in Ukraine. Camões speaks for themselves, in different years and always accompanied by the events of the year. I sometimes put Camões talking for me. My companion always tells me, that I put Camões to say what I want."
There have been times, and posters, in which the artist portrayed some episodes of Macao's current, such as increasing the installation of video surveillance chambers or even the ban on smoking in certain sites. "I felt that, within the Portuguese community and all of Macau, this episode [the prohibition of smoking] had been like an aggression. Sometimes I hear the concerns of the community and also mine, not only in relation to Portugal, but also to Macau. These themes can emerge isolated, but also linked to Camões and other names I put [in the posters], he added.
The artist and the poet
Ironically, Vítor Hugo Marreiros's relationship with the writing of Camões, whether poetry, letters or the Lusíadas themselves is not very close to - the artist even though he prefers Fernão Mendes Pinto's pilgrimage. "I find it funnier." Os Lusíadas "is a heavier, strong, heroic work. I prefer the 'pilgrimage', and even to draw has more joke. Whenever I need to do some work, with a historical, news or literary part, I always start reading the 'pilgrimage'.
Incidentally, Vítor Hugo Marreiros always says looking for explanations whenever his drawings block with the need for some factual or historical information. "I am a Dracula. When I need anything linked to medicine, I go to my friend. I am not ashamed to ask a lawyer friend. I take advantage of the culture of others as well, because it is very important to research," he said.
At the Galeria R through the Gallery, "There are different arrangements in technical terms and there is room for new interpretations." Vítor Hugo Marreiros says he has not yet tired of making the poster and has even prepared for the next two years.
“There is room for new images. Camões has to always appear, but it is accompanied by figures of current events, period figures, national concerns. There are those who say I'm a political chart, but I am not very close to politics, I worry more about society. For example, in the last poster of June 10, I also put a conversation between D. Afonso Henriques and the president of FC Porto Costa], because D. Afonso Henriques was king and he was the president. There are small details, I play with serious things, but I do not teach anything.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Crime | Detained on suspicions of illegal money exchange</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/crime-detida-por-suspeitas-de-troca-ilegal-de-dinheiro/</link><description>A 40 -year -old resident was arrested by the Judiciary Police near a casino on suspicion of the crime of illegal money exchange.

The employee filed a complaint against the company in the US after, in his words, he made several alerts about the situation
 
Admittedly, the former bosses of the Junket Sunning (Alvin Chau) and Tak Chun (Levo Chan) groups are already fulfilled the penalties to which they were convicted, but organized crime cases associated with the two companies that operated in the Macao game sector, raising VIP customers, still raise controversy.
This time, an former employee of consultant Ernst &amp; Young (EY), Joe Howie, who put the company in court accusing it of ignoring the warning signs that something was not well in these Junket companies or in associated companies.
Joe Howie, who co-led EY's global excellence center, says that for years he has warned of adherence to standards defined by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, resisting investigations or denying suspending contracts with clients being investigated.
According to Agbrief portal, Howie worked 35 years at EY and, under the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act” legislation, has now complained in a US Federal Court, claiming that the company retaliated against it for alerting the operations of SUNCITY and CHUN TAK. According to the complaint, violations of the US securities and anti -tic conduct laws are concerned.
In the judicial action it is indicated that EY has done for years consulting work and has audited accounts of the two Junket companies also in other Asian markets. The employee says Ey knew he was working with companies linked to the Suncity group, including US people who had major operations in Macao casinos. EY will not have noticed the absence of data provided by these companies to the consultant.
"Despite repeated warnings, EY continued to profit from contracts signed with these high-risk clients," reads the process. Joe Howie was “marginalized and forced to reform in advance, being expelled from society as a form of retaliation,” is referred to.
The Three Families
In the complaint starring Joe Howie, it is also read that five companies listed in the US, and with connections near the local game sector, were associated with “families linked to the Chinese triads, including Stanley Ho descendants”, and the complaint “identifies three families, but by the association and papers they had in companies, allegedly linked to Alvin Chau Empire Junket and Other contact networks, ”reads the news.
The Agbrief portal also writes that in the complaint against EY there are accusations that it has “provided opinions in the poorly qualified audit, failing to report and identify failures in programs against capital laundering or conflicts of interest”.
On the EY side, the reaction was of unresponsiveness, noting that the accusations are not properly substantiated and that they are based on information disclosed by the media, noting that the processes of the groups of Sunctity and Tak Chun were "considered speculative and politically motivated."</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 01:54:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Game | GrandView Casino-Satellite will close doors tomorrow</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/jogo-casino-satelite-grandview-vai-fechar-portas-amanha/</link><description>GrandView is the first casino-satellite to end since the legal reform that dictated the end of these spaces. According to the SJM concessionaire and DICJ, at least seven residents may be unemployed, while the number of non-resorted workers was not revealed
 
Although satellites are allowed to operate by the end of the year, the GrandView Casino in Taipa will end the doors tomorrow. The announcement was made yesterday by the concessionaire SJM Resorts, through a statement, and directly affects 166 workers. According to the Directorate of Inspection and Coordination of Games (DICJ), seven of these resident workers will be dismissed.
Satellite casinos result from agreements between some independent dealers and companies, which exploit various game spaces. According to the latest changes proposed by the government and approved by the Legislative Assembly, satellite casinos have to be closed by the end of the year. The alternative is now explored by the dealers, a situation that will only be seen with the L'ARC and Ponte 16 casinos.
"Following the general planning of the company and commercial considerations, the GrandView Casino will officially cease operations earlier than expected, at 11:59 pm on Wednesday, July 30, 2025," was justified. “All game tables currently operating on site will be redistributed to other company casinos to continue to serve our estimated customers,” he was added.
The company also communicated customers with cards, deposits or cash discounts accumulated at the GrandView casino that if they are not reimbursed after closing they can go to the Casa Real casino to deal with the situation. "The company will ensure that all customer rights will be properly honored," he was nominated.
Assured jobs
In the statement issued yesterday morning, the company assured that “all local workers”, hired by SJM, who worked at the GrandView Casino will be transferred to other casinos “according to operational needs”. The potential vacancy of dismissal will only affect non-resident workers, although the number has not been disclosed.
The concessionaire also reported that the seven employees of the company that explores the casino and that they will be unemployed can apply for jobs and will have "priority in hiring equal circumstances." "The company is still committed to fulfill its business responsibilities and contribute to the stable development of the Macao game sector in partnership with the local community," he was bound.
Dicj accompanies closure
Minutes after the SJM statement, also the Game Inspection and Coordination Directorate (DICJ) took a position on a much discussed subject in society and far from consensus, mainly due to the impact on indirect jobs, ie business -generated by restaurants, pledge or hotels that survive due to customers of these casinos.
"As for casino-satellite workers, the DICJ will maintain close communication with the direction of services to labor affairs (DSAL), in order to ensure strict compliance with the commitments made by the SJM, namely the proposal previously presented, as regards the remuneration, the perks and working conditions of its 159 workers highlighted in the referred casino satellite," he was informed.
"And at the same time, providing opportunities to change employment to the 7 workers recruited by the casino-satellite itself, in order to ensure their employment continuity," he was stressed. In the statement, the government indicates that the SJM decision resulted from commercial logic, despite admitting that the law was amended and that the satellite casinos become illegal next year.
DICJ also reported that it will send workers to the scene to ensure the "proper treatment of cash and play cards stored in the treasury, unused cash coupons and the exchange of the play cards."</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 01:52:10</pubDate></item><item><title>SJM confirms construction of low -cost hotel on Mountain Island</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/sjm-confirma-construcao-de-hotel-de-baixo-custo-na-ilha-da-montanha/</link><description>The Macau Holdings Game Society (SJM) announced yesterday that it will even build a three -star hotel in Hengqin after having acquired parts of the “Xin de Kou An Shang Wu Zhong Xin” real estate development, through subsidiary SJM Investment Limited.

The venture has a “strategic proximity to the central sights of the group”, being a ten-minute drive from Grand Lisboa Palace, Cotai, and 30 minutes from the Grand Lisboa Hotel, in the center of the Macao Peninsula. In this way, new opportunities “for operational synergies, infrastructure sharing and promotions between enterprises” are unlocked.

The child was alone at home, while the maid went to pick up his brother from school
 
The Judicial Police (PJ) indicated the mother and maid of the crime of abandonment, after a child fell from a window when he was alone at home. The case took place on July 15, but the information about the investigation was revealed on Friday by PJ, according to the newspaper or Mun.
The case was discovered around 1 pm, when the boy was found on the floor of Gamboa Street, after falling from a four -story building. The victim of the fall was taken to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with an intra-cranial hemorrhage, being hospitalized. Until yesterday, the authorities did not reveal whether the male child was at risk of life.
Given the possibility of having a crime, the PJ agents investigated the fall and found that on the morning of the accident both the parents and the child's brother had left home. The child stood to keep a maid, who was also responsible for fetching the victim's older brother from school.
When she fetched her brother, the maid left the boy alone at home with a tablet and locked the housing door. The minor's mother was informed about the conditions in which the child had been left.
However, the PJ says it concluded that when the child was alone at home began to cry and scared. The victim also tried to use tools to open the door. However, as it could not open the door, the authorities believe that the child tried to get out of housing through the kitchen window, which led to the fall.
Authorities also found that this was not the first time the boy has been home alone, which would have happened more often since June 17. The child's injuries were considered consistent with a fall in height.
The case was delivered to the prosecutor and the mother and worker are indicted for the crime of abandonment, punished with a sentence of one to five years in prison, which in this case may be aggravated to eight years in prison, if it is considered that the injuries are serious offense to physical integrity.
Accompanying
After the investigation was made public, Hon Wai, president of the Institute of Social Action, said the family is being accompanied and that is "deeply sad", according to the Macao channel of TDM. "Unfortunately, I believe everyone knows this unfortunate incident. The family is deeply sad and IAS is providing direct assistance to the family," he said. "We need to work hard with this family, how to deal with the future and the care of children," he acknowledged.
According to the or world, the president of IAS also called on families to avoid leaving children alone at home, even if it is for a short time, because there are always "risks" in these situations.
Hon Wai thus asked families to try better coordination to accompany children and involve more members in the surveillance of minors.</description><pubDate>2025-07-28 04:37:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Cotai | Show in the canceled outdoor zone</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/28/cotai-espectaculo-na-zona-ao-ar-livre-cancelado/</link><description>Contrary to what was planned, the performance of a show at the “Outdoor Show site” planned for early September was canceled, according to a press release of the Cultural Institute (IC).

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.
 
10/28/22
In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Aqui está alguém a quem a crença trouxe ponderação!”, pensei, uma aliança rara.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I do not always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification as to their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funeral trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells will we have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts him a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people, which always seems the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my rank of hatter at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

The China Buddhist Association, subordinate to the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Department, announced that he had withdrawn the certificate of monastic ordination to the religious after receiving a request from the Provincial Association of Henan.
59 -year -old Shi Yongxin is suspected of having diverted funds linked to temple projects and usurping the monastery's assets, and for years maintaining relations with several women, of which he will have had at least one child, according to religious authorities.
Located in the central province of Henan, the Shaolin Temple is one of the best known in China and the international symbol of Chan Buddhism and Kung-Fu, subjects that have given it worldwide fame and turned it into an important tourist destination.
Known by the secular name Liu Yincheng, Shi Yongxin had led the temple three decades ago. Built over 1,500 years ago, in Dengfeng, the monastery is considered the cradle of Zen Buddhism and Shaolin martial arts.
By 2015, the monk had already been the target of similar accusations made by former monks and temple officials, but authorities then closed the case without charges.

Hours before the negotiations began, representatives from both countries exchanged accusations
 
Thailand and Cambodia agreed with a “immediate and unconditional ceasefire, the Prime Minister of Malaysia announced yesterday after performing peace negotiations. Anwar Ibrahim, who received leaders from both countries, said the ceasefire will start at midnight on Monday, local time.
"Both Cambodia and Thailand have reached a common understanding," said Ibrahim after mediation negotiations in Malaysia. The ambassadors of the United States and China in Malaysia were also present at the meeting in the administrative capital of Malaysia, Putrajaya.
Malaysia holds the rotating presidency of the Southeast Asia Nations Association (Asean), of which Bangkok and Phnom Penh are members, and already intervened as a mediator between the parts on the second day of the difference.
At least 35 people were killed and more than 270,000 displaced by the worst fighting in more than a decade among neighboring countries. The clashes continued in the early hours of Monday, a few hours before the negotiations began. In addition to the physical confrontation, the leaders of both countries also exchanged accusations hours before negotiations that seem to point to the end of the conflict.
The Thai Acting Prime Minister accused Cambodia of lack of "good faith" by leaving for Malaysia. "We don't think Cambodia is acting in good faith, taking into account the actions to solve the problem. They have to show a sincere intention," Phumtham Wechayachai told journalists at the Bangkok airport.
Cambodia also stated that the attacks continued in the early hours of Monday in the temples of Ta Moan Thom and Ta Kraby, over 400 kilometers of Bangkok and Phnom Penh. Cambodian Ministry of Defense spokesman Mlay Socheata said at a press conference that Thailand attacked Cambodian territory between Sunday and yesterday dawn with artillery obuses and fragmentation pumps.
“We underline the need for both parties to exercise the maximum containment and commit to immediate ceasefire, refraining from any action that may harm it,” reads a statement from the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs even before the meeting.
"We have exhorted both parties to cease all hostilities, to return to the negotiation table to restore peace and stability, and to solve different ways and divergences by peaceful means," said the government of Kuala Lumpur.
Attentive powers
United States Diplomacy Chief Marco Rubio urged the two countries to decrease the tensions “immediately” and to agree with a ceasefire in the border dispute. "Both the president [Donald] Trump and I are in contact with our counterparts from each country and we are following the situation very close. We want this conflict to finish as soon as possible," Rubio pointed out on the social network X.
Also the Chinese Foreign Ministry has appealed to peace. "Cambodia and Thailand are nearby neighbors and friends from China. Peace and the good neighborhood are of the common interest of both parties," said Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun at a press conference.
The statements come after the Thai interim prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, quoted China, along with the United States and Malaysia, as one of the countries that "intervened to help" the meeting between Bangcoque and Phnom Penh, in confrontation since last Thursday due to a territorial dispute on the ordinary border.
In addition to Washington, Beijing and Asean, also the UN, European Union, Japan and Russia, among others, appealed to containment and dialogue between the parties.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 02:19:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs | China and the United States gathered to extend truce</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/29/tarifas-china-e-estados-unidos-reunidos-para-prolongar-tregua/</link><description>American and Chinese guardians have been gathered since yesterday in Stockholm, with the aim of prolonging the truce in the trade war between the two largest economies in the world, in an uncertain context.

Analysts advised a reduction in supply
 
According to the Financial Times (FT) editorial, published on Sunday, “few believe that sustained prices growth is back,” due to the weak internal demand. Beijing has made efforts to encourage consumption, but will have to go further, namely by strengthening social pension systems and benefits, to reduce families' preventive savings.
The FT also underlines that the deflationary dynamics will not be fought if the Chinese Communist Party does not face the excess of offer.
Deflation consists of a drop in prices over time, as opposed to a climb (inflation). The phenomenon reflects weakness in domestic consumption and investment and is particularly dangerous, as a drop in the price of assets, as a rule of credit, generates an imbalance between the value of loans and bank guarantees. Another effect is to lead to the postponement of consumer and investment decisions as a result of lower pricing expectations in the future, and can create a price -descendant spiral and look hard to reverse, affecting the entire economy.
The risk of deflation in the Chinese economy has worsened in the last two years, raised by a profound real estate crisis, which has affected investment and consumption, and excessive production capacity in various sectors.
Production prices have been falling since October 2022, in a context where Chinese factories reduce prices to maintain market share, both in traditional industries, steel and cement, and in modern sectors, including electric vehicles, solar panels and artificial intelligence.
The British newspaper recalls that Chinese President Xi Jinping, and other responsible responsible has denying external concerns about excessive production capacity to criticize domestic manufacturers by the Neijuan phenomenon, an expression used to describe excessive competition in prices.
Efficiency
The editorial emphasizes that Beijing's own policies have feed the problem, with the bet on “new quality productive forces”, aimed at advanced technologies and new industries, triggering a race to attract political support and local subsidies. The result is “an investment outbreak with excessive duplications”, leading to price cuts and stored products, from electrical vehicles parked in ports to semiconductors to unused artificial intelligence systems.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for Chinese manufacturers to export this over production as business partners are more aware of the impact of importing cheap products on their local industries," says the newspaper.
Several of the major business partners in the Asian country, including European Union, United States, but also developing countries such as Brazil, have adopted protectionist measures, including increased customs rates, and launched anti -dumping investigations against China. Dumping consists of sale below production cost.
Financial Times argues that Beijing should limit “generosity of the state” and create a more unified national market, restricting distortion incentives from local governments. It also proposes to change the provincial goals, reducing the emphasis on gross domestic product, and reinforcing the protection of intellectual property to encourage more innovative differentiation.
According to the editorial, Xi Jinping may try to set production ceilings and press manufacturers to reduce the offer, but "Beijing will do well to realize that their excessive support is the problem." “The state can build factories, but cannot manufacture efficiency,” says Financial Times.</description><pubDate>2025-07-29 02:10:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Thailand agrees in principle with ceasefire with Cambodia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/28/diplomacia-tailandia-concorda-em-principio-com-cessar-fogo-com-camboja/</link><description>Thailand's interim prime minister Phumtham Wechayachai said yesterday that the country agreed, in principle, with a ceasefire, but emphasized the need for “sincere intentions” by Cambodia
 
According to Thai Foreign Ministry, Phumtham WeChayachai called on rapid bilateral negotiations to discuss concrete measures towards a peaceful conflict resolution.
The current government leader also thanked the president of the United States, with whom he spoke hours earlier, in a telephone conversation where Donald Trump presented a ceasefire proposal.
Also Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said yesterday that the country accepted negotiations for an "immediate and unconditional ceasefire." "This is good news for soldiers and people from both countries," said Cambodian leader in a statement.
Manet instructed Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn to start discussions with US counterpart Marco Rubio to end the conflict that broke out on Thursday.
Still, journalists from the France-Presse news agency in Samraong, Cambodia, about 20 kilometers from the Thailand border, heard the sound of artillery shots at dawn.
A spokeswoman for the Cambodia Ministry of Defense also stated that Thailand had attacked at 4:50 am (05h50 in Macao) near two temples whose sovereignty is disputed by the two countries.
Colonel Richa Suksowanont, the Thai army deputy spokesman, accused Cambodian forces of shooting yesterday morning heavy artillery against Surin's province, including civilian houses.
Richa Suksowanont said Cambodia also launched rocket attacks against the former Ta Muen Thom temple, claimed by both countries, and other areas, in an attempt to recover the protected territory by Thai troops.
The Thai forces responded with long-range artillery to reach the artillery and the Cambojan launches. Battlefield operations will continue and a ceasefire can only happen if Cambodia formally starts negotiations, Richa Suksowanont added.
On the other side
Cambodian Ministry of Defense spokesman, Lieutenant General Maly Socheata, accused Thai forces of intensifying violence with bombing in Cambodian territory on Sunday morning, followed by a “large-scale foray” involving land tanks and troops in various areas. "Such actions undermine all efforts to a peaceful resolution and expose Thailand's clear intention to intensify the conflict rather than appease it," he said.
A historic border dispute between the two countries led on Thursday to clashes that involved fighters, tanks, land troops and artillery.
The fighting caused 33 deaths and more than 130,000 displaced on both sides of the border. The balance already exceeds the previous series of major border clashes between the two countries, which caused 28 deaths between 2008 and 2011.
The UN Security Council met in urgent and, on Saturday, the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, condemned the escalation of violence between Thailand and Cambodia, asked both parties who commit to a ceasefire and offered as a mediator.</description><pubDate>2025-07-28 04:59:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Telegram | Thousands of men shared intimate photos of women</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/28/telegram-milhares-de-homens-partilharam-fotos-intimas-de-mulheres/</link><description>Thousands of men in China shared pictures and intimate videos of their girlfriends or wives, without their consent, in applying Telegram messages, which generated a general appeal to reinforce women's protection.
The wave of reactions occurred after a Chinese student was expelled from a university in mid-July for “violation of national dignity” after an e-sport's Ukrainian player released videos on Telegram, showing that they had intimate relationships.
A similar event took place on Thursday. A Chinese discovered that photos of her, taken without her knowledge, were shared in a forum of this same messaging with over 100,000 users, especially Chinese men, revealed Southern Daily, a state of state communication.
“We are not content that can be discharged, viewed and randomly fantasized,” one can read in a comment on the Red Note social network. “We can no longer remain silent.” Because next time, I can be me, or be you, ”he adds.
Pornography is illegal in China and conservative behaviors in relation to women remain the norm, reinforced by state media and popular culture. The largest group of this type on Telegram, called “Mask Park”, has been removed since, but smaller groups derived from this remain active, according to the woman contacted by Southern Daily.
Other forum members also shared photos of their current or old companions, according to an article published in the Guangming Daily, a medium of communist communisting Chinese in power, raising a general shock on the Internet.
A hashtag associated with this case has been consulted more than 230 million times on the Weibo social platform since Thursday. Chinese authorities have not yet announced any measures against Telegram, which is forbidden in China, but is still accessible through some virtual private networks, the platform told AFP news agency.</description><pubDate>2025-07-28 04:56:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Technology | Beijing wants to reconcile artificial intelligence and its risks</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/28/tecnologia-pequim-quer-reconciliar-inteligencia-artificial-e-o-seus-riscos/</link><description>The Chinese government has called for reconciliation between the development of artificial intelligence and the risks posed by this technology, defending global consensus, despite the rivalry between Beijing and Washington on this issue
 
US President Donald Trump released this week an action plan to promote unrestricted development of American Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in the United States and abroad, discarding concerns about potential abuse. The US president thus breaks with the line of democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who defended controlled development. “We won't let any other nation won us” in the AI race, Trump said.
On Saturday, at the opening of the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (Waic) in Shanghai, Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang appealed to good governance and resource sharing, namely the creation of an organism, launched by China, to stimulate international AI cooperation. "The risks and challenges associated with artificial intelligence are attracting wide attention ... Finding a balance between development and safety requires urgent and broader consensus of the whole of society," he said.
It did not provide details about the new body, although state media reported that “the first consideration” was that the headquarters was in Shanghai (Northeast). The organization should “promote global governance, broad consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits,” said Chinese state news agency Xinhua.
A Baby Tiger
At a time when AI is being part of virtually all sectors, use has raised significant ethical issues ranging from disinformation to impact on employment and potential loss of technological control, France-Presse news agency said.
During a speech at the Shanghai Conference, the Nobel Prize for Physics, Geoffrey Hinton, used a metaphor, 'as a baby tiger to live at home' to describe the current global situation. Hinton described the current attitude towards AI as similar to "a person adopting a cute tiger puppy as a pet." "To survive," he said, "one must be sure that one can train him so that he doesn't kill him when he grows up."
The huge advances in AI technology in recent years have also placed her at the forefront of rivalry between the United States and China. China “actively encourages” the development of open source AI and is willing to share technological advances with other countries, especially developing nations, he said.
"If we establish technological monopolies, controls or barriers, artificial intelligence risks becoming a privilege of a small number of countries and companies," he warned, in turn, Li Qiang. Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu warned, in turn, against "unilateralism and protectionism" at a subsequent meeting.
The United States has intensified efforts in recent years to restrict advanced chip exports to China, with Washington to manifest concern that they can be used to modernize Chinese military and weaken the US position in technology race.
The Chinese prime minister cited “the scarcity of chips and computational capacity” between a list of obstacles to the development of the sector.</description><pubDate>2025-07-28 04:53:33</pubDate></item><item><title>North Korea | Kim calls for preparation “for war seriously”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/25/coreia-do-norte-kim-pede-preparacao-para-guerra-a-serio/</link><description>The North Korean leader asked the country's soldiers to prepare "for a serious war," during a witnessing scout he witnessed, the Official North Korean press said yesterday.

Images released by the agency also showed projectiles to be fired towards the sea.
During the visit, Kim spoke to the North Korean soldiers, whom they asked to prepare “for a serious war” and to be able to “destroy the enemy in all battles,” according to KCNA.
This visit happens after a North Korean contingent participated in combat against the Ukrainian forces in the Russian region of Kursk, partially occupied by Kiev troops since the summer of 2024 and that Russia announced that it had fully resumed in late April.</description><pubDate>2025-07-25 04:59:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Thailand | Nine dead and 14 injured by Cambojan air strikes</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/25/tailandia-nove-mortos-e-14-feridos-por-ataques-aereos-cambojanos/</link><description>Cambojan air strikes killed nine people, including an eight -year -old, and wounded 14, the Thai army said yesterday, the day the conflict between the two countries intensified
 
Nine people died and 14 were injured in Thailand following the Cambodian air strike offensive. According to the Thai army, one of the deadly victims was a 14 -year -old child. Thailand said it had launched air strikes against two military targets in Cambodia, while Cambodian soldiers fired several rockets against Thai territory.
Six people were killed in attacks near a fuel supply post in Sisaket (Northeast), two in the province of Surin (Northeast) and one in the province of Ubon Ratchathani (Northeast).
Thai authorities announced the full closure of all terrestrial border passages with Cambodia, after clashes between the two armies in various areas that separate these neighboring countries.
The level of security in the border passages was high for the 4-the maximum-which constitutes a complete closure, said at a press conference the spokesman for the Thai center that monitors the situation on the border with Cambodia, Admiral Surasant KongSiri.
"Given the current situation, it is necessary for Thailand to close the barriers on border passages to protect our sovereignty, territorial integrity and the safety of people in border zones," said the center of the Center, Maratee Nalita at the same time.
Coveted land
Since late June, Thailand has implemented access restrictions on all border posts over the more than 800 kilometers of border that shares with Cambodia, allowing entry only for humanitarian reasons, health or education.
The total closure comes after yesterday's clashes between Thai and Cambodian armies in a border zone disputed, according to both sides, who mutually accuse themselves to start the conflict after weeks of tension.
However, Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Manet yesterday requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. "Considering the recent extremely serious aggressions of Thailand, which have severely threatened peace and stability in the region, I sincerely ask you to call an emergency meeting of the Security Council to end Thailand's aggression," Hun Manet wrote in a letter to the President of Security Council, Asim Iftikhar Ahmad.
The longstanding conflict between the two countries rekindled on May 28, after a confrontation between the two armies around an unrestricted border zone claimed by the two nations, which resulted in the death of a Cambodian soldier.
The Thailand Embassy in Cambodia yesterday asked Thai citizens to abandon the neighboring country, after the confrontations and given the possibility of the attacks "continuing and spreading." Territorial tension has been usually approached diplomatically, although between 2008 and 2011, about 30 people died in military clashes between the two countries in a territory adjacent to the Hindu Temple of Preah Vihear.</description><pubDate>2025-07-25 04:57:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Anabela Santiago, Academic: “China is a reformist and moderate”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/anabela-santiago-academica-a-china-e-reformista-e-moderada/</link><description>Anabela Santiago has just defended at the University of Aveiro the doctoral thesis that analyzes how China has been positioned in recent decades as an important actor in the “global health governance”. Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that to realize the will already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those who provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao, between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary-general guaranteed to have "all the pleasure of working with all parties," but stressed that this is a "decision that is up to the central governments to make" and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, is not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a theme that is being debated in the world worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new direction of the fund "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, if by case the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibility of rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but also from countries, but also from countries, but also from countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish-speaking institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo.

Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave to the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the appropriate place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macau, Camões has been poorly enjoyed in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hate speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Great Bay Race learned more pilots for the GP</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/corrida-da-grande-baia-apurou-mais-pilotos-para-o-gp/</link><description>The GT Cup Races - Great Bay Race, integrated at the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix, ended with a double journey at the Pingtan Speed Festival last weekend of June. Of the twenty -eight vacancies assigned by the first two GT Cup races, only one Macao pilot got a direct entrance at the great sports event of November.
Following the success of the two races played under the China Formula 1 Grand Prix, both 30 -minute races of the GT4 Chinese Championship had a total of 21 participants at the event held at the International Circuit of Lago Ruyi in Pingtan. This picturesque track, located in Fujian province, replaced the Zhuhai International Circuit, initially included in the provisional calendar released in January, but did not confirm the holding of his event.
In Pingtan's semiurban layout, Chinese pilot Han Lichao won both races behind his Toyota GR Supra GT4 EVO2. In two very lively races, Kevin Leong Ian Veng (BMW M4 GT4) was the only Macau pilot scoring, having reached a sixth and eighth place, respectively.
Although only one Pilot of the Misrem has guaranteed the direct determination, it is possible that more riders in the territory will align on the GT - Great Bay Race, integrated in the Macao Grand Prix. This is because only 21 pilots scored in these four races, which means that even if all these pilots are signed up for the guide circuit race, seven vacancies will still be filled.
In addition to Kevin Leong, seven other pilots from Macau - Miguel Law, Wong Cheng Tou, Fok Wai Ming, Lao Kim Hou, IP Un Hous, Wong Wai Hong and Law Kit Meng - participated in at least one of the two qualification events and may be repaired for local test if the sports committee's sports committee of the Macau Grand Prix so.
Among the riders are some known names of the region's motorsport, such as Darryl O'Young, double winner of the Macau GT Cup; Chen Weian, 12 -hour separate winner; Liu Kaishun, Chinese F4 runner-up; Daniel Lu, former Champion of the Porsche Carrera Asia Cup; or Luo Kailuo, winner of the GT Cup - Great Bay Race at Macao's 70th Grand Prix.
It's not over yet
This debut season, Sro GT Cup still has two more pointed events, the last, naturally, played in the iconic Guide Circuit. The competition, which has the support of the Macao General Automobile Association - China (AAMC), has reached its intermediate point, and the struggle for the title is in the red. Prior to the mandatory visit to Macau, from 17 to 19 October, the GT4 category cars will compete at the first event held on the streets of Yizhuang, in Beijing.
Beijing's Citadino Circuit is one of the most anticipated auto events in the Popular Republic of China and represents an excellent opportunity for Macao GT4 riders - and not only to prepare for the big challenge that are the curves and counterclaces of the territory layout.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:45:06</pubDate></item><item><title>TCR China | André Couto participated in the Zhejiang race</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/01/tcr-china-andre-couto-participou-na-prova-de-zhejiang/</link><description>Over the weekend, André Couto had an unexpected return to the TCR China Championship, in what was his first race of this season. The rider of the sgas showed that "who knows, never forgets", despite having had a troubled passage through the Zhejiang International Circuit
The Portuguese pilot residing in Macao, who has not competed since November last year-when he played the World Lamborghini Super Trofeo World Finals, having won the title in the Pro-AM category of Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia-received a last-minute invitation from MacPro Racing Team to conduct one of the Honda Civic Fl5 TCR Territory in the third race of the Chinese championship TCR.
Without any prior training, André Couto came back to sit in a car he already knew, also with a technical structure that was familiar to him. By 2023, the territory pilot had already played some TCR China events with this set, then at the service of the official team Dongfeng Honda Racing Team, showing a progress right from the beginning.
"Free training did not go wrong, but in qualification a less attentive pilot hit me on my first departure lap to the track. He hit me from behind and did not realize why. Damaged me the rear, dislocated the convergence and the car was crooked. Hm. "Still, I qualified myself in fourth in Q1, five tenths of the first, which, with the car in the conditions it was, was not bad. The car had potential."
In Q2, due to the damage, the Japanese car “became much harder to guide” and Couto ended in tenth. However, this ended up having a positive effect: “With the reversal of the starting grid, the tenth place of Q2 allowed me to start first to the second race.”
The first race, played on Saturday on the shaoxing track, did not go as well as the pilot wanted, not being able to follow the official links, nor the best Honda and Hyundai. "I ended up eighth. The car was not as good as I expected and we found that there was a damaged damper, still from the crash in the qualification, which was exchanged for the Sunday race."
Inglorius Sunday
In the 20-lathe race, André Couto had everything to shine, as he departed from Pole-Posation and Honda finally seemed in a position to fight for the first places. "On the back of training, the car was good. I didn't feel strange anymore and I was optimistic."
The idea was to get well to distance themselves from the fastest competitors in the first laps and then manage the race with new tires. However, it all faded quickly when it was wrapped by Wu Yi Fan right in the brake for the first curve.
“That was my mission, but I couldn't,” acknowledged the winner of the 2000 Macao Grand Prix. “He hit me on the first curve and the car was damaged. Sports commissioners, but that does not change the fact that I have given up. ”
With Honda's damaged direction, André Couto had no choice but to leave. "I was a bit disappointed because I hope to get a good result for MacPro Racing Team that had given me a good car.</description><pubDate>2025-07-01 00:26:00</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA has already defined what the F4 World Cup will be like</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/25/gp-fia-ja-definiu-como-sera-a-taca-do-mundo-de-f4/</link><description>The Macao Grand Prix hosts the first edition of the FIA Formula 4 World Cup, between November 13 and 16 this year. The International Automobile Federation has published the Sports Regulation, which reveals some details about what will be the latest cup in the world integrated into the 72nd Macau Grand Program
 
Registration for the Formula 4 Macao Race - Formula 4 World Cup of the International Automobile Federation (FIA) is open until July 30, and FIA is the selection of the pilots who will participate. FIA responsible will have been pre-selected by the best Formula 4 national championship riders, also encouraging all the pilots interested in directly contacting the FIA and providing details of their sports history to be considered.
The final list of twenty pilots will be confirmed through an official invitation letter, taking into account the current classification of the pilots in the respective championships. The final selection should only be made public in mid -October, as is tradition in the guide circuit test.
At a time when behind the scenes, it is spoken of the possibility of increasing the minimum age of formula 4 to 16 years, the sports regulation stipulates that all pilots must be at least 15 years old, and the birthday is binding. An inscribed pilot may not have participated in more than two races of a championship with any type of monolugar that has been conceived and/or built to achieve a power-to-weight ratio of less than 3.0 kg/hp, which prevents participation in this riders running regional formula seasons or Formula 3.
The sports regulation does not specify technical details, but in previous communications, the FIA had already confirmed that Mintimes - organizer of the F4 Chinese Championship - will be the “unique operator” of the race, together with FFSA (Fédération Française Du Sport Automobile (FFSA), responsible for the world's cup technical support. In practice, all competitors will use Mygale M21-F4 singlesules, recently re-baptized as Ligier JS F422.
These formulas, equipped with 1.3 -liter Turbo Renault engines, will be rented to teams from the interior of China and operated by a single technical team - the same that organizes the French F4 Championship. Pirelli will be the exclusive tire supplier, as is the case with the Macao Grand Prix of Regional Formula and the FIA GT World Cup.
Although the official time of the event has not yet been released, it is known that the World Cup will feature a qualification race played over 8 laps, or at most 60 minutes, most likely on Saturday. The main race will be held on Sunday, with 10 laps or, equally, a maximum of 60 minutes. Prior to that, a 40 -minute free training session will take place, followed by a qualification session with the same duration.
PATACA AND POINTS
About 350,000 patacas in monetary awards will be distributed to the competitors present in this first cup of the world, with the winner of the main race to raise eight thousand US dollars. As a curiosity, all participants will receive three hundred dollars of participation-the same value attributed to the pole-position of Saturday's qualification race and the rider who reaches the highest tip speed during the event.
More important than the monetary awards, the FIA Formula 4 World Cup winner on the streets of Macau will win two points for the super license - points that may be decisive to access the restricted Formula 1 world. The winner will also be forced to attend the FIA awards ceremony, which will take place on December 12 in Tashkentão, USBekistan.</description><pubDate>2025-07-25 05:01:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Lamborghini | Charles Leong returns to the Academy of Young Pilots</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/20/lamborghini-charles-leong-regressa-a-academia-de-jovens-pilotos/</link><description>The Lamborghini Squadra Corso, the Automobili Lamborghini competition division, will give Macau pilot a new opportunity for Macao Charles Leong Hon Chio, who was again selected to join the Italian -brand prestigious youth academy, the “Young Driver Program”
 
Charles Leong, who participates for the second year in a row in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia, by SJM team Theodore Racing, currently leads the Pro category, with four wins in six races already played. This weekend, the territory pilot travels to South Korea to compete in the fourth race of the Sant'Agata Bolognese builder's Asian competition season, a small locality in the Emilia-Romanha region in northern Italy, between Modena and Bologna.
In a statement, the transalpina brand made known that, in all, selodes were pre-selected pilots of the various Super Trofeo championships and five of the various international GT3 championships, including Portuguese Rodrigo Testa, for the annual Lamborghini Squadra Corso program, which focuses on both track and outside performance. The twenty -one pilots will be accompanied and evaluated throughout the season, with specific analysis of their progression, consistency, experience, professionalism and ability to provide technical feedback. In addition, five additional pilots are part of Lamborghini's young professional pilots, receiving direct support from the factory in Sant'Agata Bolognese and Scola Federale ACI Sport, an entity managed by the Italian Federation.
The big news for the 2025 edition of the Young Driver Program is the selection process: it failed to settle only in age criteria, focusing on the most impressive pilots of the first two rounds of the year, based on a classification coefficient covering the three continental championships. The pilots were evaluated by Scoola Federale ACI-Sport chief instructor Niki Cadei, in collaboration with YDP consultants and official Lamborghini drivers Andrea Caldarelli (North America), who has already competed at the Macao Grand Prix, and Marco Mapelli (Europe and Asia), taking into account several performance indicators.
The results of qualification training and racing are thoroughly analyzed, such as track conduct, the pilot's post-end reports and the technical feedback provided to engineers and Squadra corse's technical team. The average score determines the final list of pilots selected for the decisive phase. A group of these young pilots will participate in a dedicated training camp at Lamborghini headquarters in Sant'Agata Bolognese, as well as at the final selection session in Misano. The best of the session will then receive support from Lamborghini Squadra Corso for the 2026 season.
Future is played in Italy
Among Super Trofeo Junior pilots, ten compete in the European series, while the rest come from the American and Asian championships. In addition to Macao's 24 -year -old pilot in Asian representation, Lamborghini also chose Singapore's Ethan Brown and Ireland's Alex Denning, which this year shares the steering wheel with Charles Leong to join this program.
Charles Leong will be evaluated throughout the season, and the final selection - whether or not to integrate Lamborghini's youth professional riders program - will be made in November at the Italian circuit of Misano, after the traditional closing of the Season of the various Super Trofeo, during the Lamborghini world endings. It is recalled that the winner of the Macao Formula 4 Grand Prix in 2020 and 2021 was part of this program last year, but was not selected. At the time, the final assessment took place at the Jerez circuit in Spain - an unknown layout, unlike his opponents.</description><pubDate>2025-07-20 15:23:35</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA AFINA REGIONAL Formula Rules</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/23/gp-fia-afina-regras-da-formula-regional/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) took advantage of the Macao Extraordinary Assemblies in Macao and its annual conference to publish the Macao Grand Prix Regulation - FIA Regional Formula Cup of 2025. There are not many changes compared to 2024, but the introduced changes aim to browse gaps from the first edition of this macau.
The twelve red flags during last year's qualification session called for the level of pilots at the Guide Circuit, which was the premiere of the FIA regional formula in Macau regional formula. This happened after the controversial decision of the FIA to consider that Formula 3 was no longer adequate to the Macao Citadino layout.
Unsurprisingly, the sports regulation is now clear that, to compete in the FIA regional formula world, “all pilots must have participated at least 3 competitions with a monolugar that has been projected and/or built to achieve a weight/power ratio of more than 3.0 kg/hp.”
Emanuele Pirro, a former F1 pilot, winner of the Guide Race and president of the FIA monoligai committee, said during the weekend of the 71st edition that, in the future, the FIA will be more demanding about track discipline. Thus, from now on, “any pilot who, in the opinion of sports commissioners, is solely responsible for the display of a red flag during the qualification training session, will not be able to continue to participate in this session and its best time back can be annulled.” The new regulation also states that “if a qualification training session is interrupted with less than four minutes remaining, it will not be restarted.”
On the other hand, the FIA maintains the limit in the participation of more experienced pilots, except only “pilots who participated in a maximum of 3 FI F2 Championship competitions of 2025.” This measure goes a little against the spirit and history of the Great Prize, which has always gathered pilots from higher categories in its main race. In fact, this was a fervent question between Macao and the International Federation on two previous occasions.
In 1985, Alfredo César Torres, then responsible for Portuguese motorsport, convinced Jean-Marie Balestre, against his will, to allow the participation of F1 pilots in the F3 Intercontinental Cup in the name of the economic viability of the race. In 2016, the controversy returned with the veto da FIA to the participation of Nelsinho Piquet, a decision badly received by the teams and then coordinator Barry Bland, which would eventually abandon the co-organization of the race a year later.
Bet on continuity
In sports terms, registrations for this second edition of the FIA regional formula Cup will remain open until July 30. The grill may include a maximum of 27 Tatuus regional formula monologues, all equipped with Alfa Romeo engines built by the Italian Autotechnic. Pirelli will once again be the official tire supplier.
The identities of the invited teams have not yet been revealed, but some news is expected in this field compared to 2024. To avoid any behind -the -scenes disputes, it has already been defined that “the position on the boxes for the teams that participate in the Macao Grand Prix will be based on the ranking of the previous year” and, in turn, “the position on the roads to new teams will be attributed based on the order of the application.”
Equal awards and more restricted advertising
The values of monetary awards remain unchanged this year, with a total of US $ 68,500 to distribute, the equivalent of just over 550,000 patacas at the current exchange rate. The race winner will receive $ 12,000, an amount that is still far from covering the costs of participation in this nature.
On the other hand, the sports regulation introduces two new prohibitions on advertising into the monoligales. In addition to the existing prohibition of advertising to fortune or bad luck, tobacco or pornography, also the promotion of electronic cigarettes and alcoholic beverages - a measure that follows the legislation in force in the territory.

Focused on obtaining information about the growth of motorsport and promoting safe, sustainable and accessible mobility to everyone in the Asia Pacific region, the FIA conference opening session highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration, as well as the region's ability to innovate and create solutions that respond to specific questions it faces.
Roberto Carlos Osório, president of the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), said the association has a strong tradition in motor racing and that following FIA's guidelines is being able to rapidly grow the base competition in the region.
“We organized the first GT Macau Cup in 2008,” said the AAMC leader. "Currently, we also have the GT Cup - Great Bay Race for GT4 cars. In addition, in 2008, we created Road Sport Challenge," he explained. “And today, in 2025, we are proud to announce that we have 68 tourism cars in the region to compete in the qualification race to enter the 72nd Macao Grand Prix.”
In a year when AAMC celebrates 30 years of existence - was born as Macao Automobile Club - we also learned that the association's bet for the future will be in the basic disciplines of motor sport. Roberto Carlos Osorio also revealed a curious fact: Macau has 135 pilots with sports license from the territory.
“This growth was achieved following FIA's guidelines to promote grassroots motorsport and create accessible races for riders in the region,” added the manager of the territory. “With the interest of pilots, teams and promoters in developing state-of-the-art activities in Macau, we will focus even more on base competitions and affordable races, not only to support tourism, but also to make Macau in a Karting international center of international events, where champions can be selected for F4 and, later, for regional formula.”
