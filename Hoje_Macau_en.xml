Donald Trump, who had previously stated that he was going to seek Lai's release before returning to power, indicated that he has already raised the issue with Beijing and insisted that he will do “everything he can to save” the former owner of the anti-china newspaper Apple Daily, to be tried in Hong Kong for accusations of collusion and section, for which he can be sentenced to perpetual arrest.
However, Trump acknowledged that "President XI [Jinping] will not be enthusiastic" to free Lai. "That said, the name [of Lai] has entered the circle of questions we are talking about and we will see what we can do," added Trump, warning that Lai "is not a young man" and that his health "is not very good."

The suspension of tariff application is the expected result of the last round of negotiations between Americans and Chinese, held in Stockholm, Sweden at the end of last month.
The possible release of Jimmy Lai, charged with several crimes under the National Security Law of the Chinese Semi-Autonic Region of Hong Kong, would be a demonstration of Xi's goodwill to advance to a commercial agreement with the US, according to western analysts with US agencies.
Lai and the three companies linked to the extinct Apple Daily newspaper, which were one of the main mentors of the anti-china actions elapsed in the former British colonial, including Hong Kong's request for occupation by foreign troops, facing accusations under the National Security Act, which provides for penalties that can go to life imprisonment for acts such as betrayal, insurrection, sabotage, external interference, section, section, section.

However, these can only work in the daytime, and should end at 21h and be able to open at 9am the next day. Restoration sector responsible applaud the measure
 
After a meeting with the Union of Associations of Macao Restoration and Beverages Owners, the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) has even decided to re -issue licenses to Esplanades, a process that had been suspended since 2009.
The experimental license request can be made since last Friday, 15. However, there are many rules to comply with these restoration establishments or bars, starting with the fact that the terraces cannot work at night. It includes “the prohibition of the functioning of the terraces between 9 pm and 9am the next day”, given “the situation of the Esplanades of Anim'Arte Nam Van or Patio of Commander Mata e Oliveira”.
In addition, “loud or other similar equipment that emit sound in the area of the terraces cannot be placed, taking into account the Environmental Noise Prevention and Control Law, describes the AMI in a note.
It is up to the establishments of the establishments to “maintain the cleaning and hygiene of the terrace and the surrounding space, periodically cleaning the respective area during the operating period and immediately arranging the place after daily use”. "Stains should be removed from the floor and immediately remove all objects from the site after the daily closure" of the terraces. There are even rules for the size of the tables and chairs to put on the street, with a cost of 1,200 patacas for each square meter of space they occupy.
Sector congratulations
16 years ago AMI has not attributed new licenses of terraces, and now it intends to do so "in order to optimize the business environment of Macao's small and medium-sized companies" and after "auscultation the opinions of the sector." However, to advance in this decision, “several factors such as the balance between the community environment and the life of the population” were taken into account.
Given that this is an experimental period of license issuance, AMI promises to "constantly monitor effectiveness, creating favorable conditions to revitalize the community economy."
However, Deputies Ngan Iek Hang, Cheung Kin Chung, and some counselors have shown in favor of this measure, saying that the most terraced creation can enrich the characteristics of Macao tourism.
Speaking to the newspaper or Mun, Cheung Kin Chung praised that the measure not only enriches the Macao cultural tourism industry, but also encourages the economic revitalization of community neighborhoods, constituting more support and a source of hope for the tourism sector.
Already Ngan Iek Hang said that clearer guidelines should be made, and there must be a narrower communication with the sector. The deputy, linked to the General Union of Macao residents' associations, also warned that the supervision mechanism should be reinforced in order to ensure that there is no violation of the new rules of the terraces, regarding the noise and cleaning of spaces.
For its part, the member of the Advisory Board for Municipal Affairs, Law Chong In, praised that the Esplanade format is very popular within China and foreign countries, not only spaces for restoration, but also cultural tourism.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:37:48</pubDate></item><item><title>GDP | MSAR ECONOMY grew by 5.1% in the second quarter</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/pib-economia-da-raem-cresceu-51-no-segundo-trimestre/</link><description>Macao Gross Domestic Product grew 5.1 percent in the second quarter of the year, in homologous terms, supported by the increase of visitors in the territory.

Under discussion since the government of Chui Sai On, the law returns to Estaca Zero, after the deputies concluded that the diploma was unable to be voted before the end of the seventh legislature
 
The revision of the road traffic law crossed the legislative agendas of Chui Executives Sai On, Ho Iat Seng and returned to the drawer in the first year of Sam Hou Fai at the head of the government.
Last Friday, the Legislative Assembly (AL) table released a deliberation, signed by the Al, Kou Hoi In, where it is indicated that “the proposed law entitled 'Road Traffic Law' does not gather the requirements for voting by the plenary”. It is added that "after the term of this legislature, the government can renew the initiative when it understands timely."
At the end of Chui's term Sai On, the government eventually removed the law from the agenda after demonstrations against the increase of fines. Following the extinction of demonstrations in the streets of Macao, the reform of the legislation that regulates traffic returned to the legislative agenda of the Ho IAT SENG Executive, but once again did not complete the process.
Almost two decades after its entry into force in October 2007, the law has been the subject of many criticism and promises of updating.
This time, the AL table indicates that the parliamentary committee responsible for analyzing in the specialty the law had August 7 as the initial period of appreciation set, a period that was extended until August 15, last Friday. In the two months preceding the end of the deadline, and the work of this legislature, Kou Hoi In will have contacted the government several times to be aware of the progress of the proposal.
Age of reason
Despite the contacts of the AL, the 1st Permanent Commission that analyzed the diploma, chaired by Ella Law, did not receive “the formal and conclusive alternative version and the work text and the initial version of the bill are immature”, is described in the text signed by Kou Hoi In.
The opinion signed by the deputies of the 1st Permanent Commission highlights that 23 meetings were held to discuss the diploma in the specialty, 14 of which with the participation of government representatives. However, the complexity of the diploma eventually dictated its "death" in the specialty. The government proposed the revocation of 39 legal diplomas, including the current road traffic law, “which implied a large legislative planning.”
The opinion points out that “taking into account the divergence of general public opinions on the changes of the law proposal, it is necessary to continue to seek consensus”, and that “the government has not yet answered the issues of the commission” and that the “new work text continues to present some problems of principle”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:31:20</pubDate></item><item><title>AL | Sam Hou Fai enhances deputies' work for constitutional order</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/al-sam-hou-fai-realca-trabalho-dos-deputados-para-ordem-constitucional/</link><description>At a dinner with all the deputies, before the election of the new Hemiciclo, the chief executive praised the work of legislators in safeguarding the “constitutional order of the sashers established by the Constitution and the Basic Law”.

According to sources cited by the newspaper, Beijing warned that excessive storage of rare lands and derived products, such as ways used on electric motors, could expose companies to higher risk of scarcity. Authorities would also be deliberately limited export volumes approved to wage the creation of large inventories abroad.
China processes about 90% of the worldwide supply of rare land and manufactures 94% of permanent iam, using this control as a pressure instrument during the commercial war with the United States. In April, he placed seven medium and heavy rare land categories on the export control list, which also encompassed permanent iam and other finished products, causing shortage in sectors such as the car.
Efforts to prevent companies from accumulating major inventories, which would give them more flexibility to respond to scarcity and price fluctuations, show Beijing's determination to maintain maximum influence on the sector, sources said.
In April, China placed seven medium-sized rare land categories on an export control list in response to the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. The measure, which also encompassed permanent iam and other finished products, caused scarcity in various sectors, particularly in the automotive industry.
Although Washington and Beijing have woken up this week a new 90 -day length of trade war, Chinese control over rare land supplies remains an important part of negotiations.
Beijing controls the production of rare land through extraction and processing quotas. Last year, only two state -owned companies received quotas.
China exported 3,188 tons of permanent rare land in June, more than twice the May volume, but less than 38% than the same month as last year. From three months to June - since Beijing imposed commercial restrictions - the exports of the imm were about half of the volume recorded in the same period of the previous year.
A study by the US Business Council, conducted in July, indicated that half of the companies inquired saw their pending or rejected export requests, especially when the volume exceeded the historical average.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:52:15</pubDate></item><item><title>PJ | Detained by burla and laundering of capital</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/pj-detido-por-burla-e-branqueamento-de-capitais/</link><description>The Judiciary Police (PJ) has detained a man from Hong Kong on suspicion of being involved in cases of circumstels and money laundering.

Costa</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/sara-f-costa/</link><description>Nursed to observing European powers to enslave and colonize various spaces around the globe, Qing Dynasty China was not interested in negotiations with Western countries. In addition to wanting to maintain distance in diplomatic and relational terms, I felt no need to import any western manufacturing, that is, it did not depend on any imports.
Several European countries, however, did trade with China as they were interested in Chinese products, especially in tea, porcelain and silk. These products were particularly appreciated by the British.
The Chinese attitude was not well regarded by Britain that was displayed before Europe as a dominant hegemonic power. Since Britain imported large amounts of tea, silk and porcelain China, via its trade balance very unbalanced with the Chinese.
This happened until they realize a highly lucrative product planted in their India colony that could be interested in the Chinese: opium. In addition to being lucrative, this product also had the power to weaken this country-continent country that appeared so interesting as a market for the European powers. With the introduction and rapid propagation of opium into Chinese society, the Beijing government decided to ban the marketing of the narcotic that was being devastating and to constitute one of the most serious public health problems in the country's history. This decision is seen by the British government as an affront to its commercial freedoms. After the introduction, marketing and spread of opium in China in 1839 Britain declares the First Opium War.
Its official narrative falls on the importance of opening China's doors to international trade, for the sake of order, stability and peace. This essay aims to refute the thesis of peace by trade referring to this historical context. When objectively analyzed the international economic situation of the time, Britain's commercial interest in China was more than evident. It was a large market and, if weakened and dominated, another colony with a lot of labor to explore. That is, behind a narrative that wanted only a modern, worldwide order and, above all, led to peace, there was a marked material interest in the Chinese market that was not harmful as it was for the British to date. Beyond material interest, the sovereign interest was also present, it was not represented in the one that would become the British colony of Hong Kong.
The mandate of the sky and the singing system
Beijing's isolation was an economic model parallel to the western model and did not fit the general belief in Europe of the 19th century. XIX that integration into an international order of law and trade was the only possibility of a sovereign state being recognized as civilized and, consequently, as peaceful - as it would become transparent, predictable and, according to Palmerston, modern (Palmerston, 1840).
However, the Qing Empire did not share this belief. By this time the mandate of heaven [i] (天命, in Pinyin: Tianming) [II] was still the model of governance followed. According to this model, diplomacy and international trade were forms of recognition of Chinese prominence. The mandate did not necessarily imply a war relationship with neighboring peoples. Like the United States, China thought he had a special role in the universal order and they were all free from enjoying the privileges that conveyed contact with its culture. However, in an antithesis to the United States, he never expressed a desire to disseminate their values around the world: it was limited to achieving foreign states to consider the tax states of China.
International trade between the Chinese and foreigners formed the first sino-widening place of the modern era. Although Porto Xiamen in Fujian, it was the main gateway with Southeast Asia and the Chinese coast, after 1759 Guangzhou had become an official door for meetings with Europeans.
The “Canton System” as it became known in the West was organized from typically Chinese lines: the government commissioned one of the Chinese families of merchants to act as controllers of trade with the abroad. These merchants formed an association known as Cohong, who responded to the command of a Guandong trade specialist, usually a Manchu sent from the Imperial Court in Beijing, known by foreigners as HOPPO. Cohong and Hoppo had the task of taxing foreigners and especially tea and silk exports.
Until 1834, when the British Indian Company lost real support to monopolize trade with China, the company had adapted to this particular singing system. During the seasons of exchanges, the Board of Directors of the British Company of India in London lived in the British Factory (Center for Commerce and Residence), in Rio, outside the Great Capital of Guangzhou, from October to March. At the time without exchanges from April to September, they retreated to the only Chinese space concessioned to Europeans, the Portuguese city of Macau.
For the Chinese, the accumulation of European interest on the Southeast coast required an efficient method to deal with “Western Sea barbarians” as they were officially designated.
Nursed to observing European powers to enslave and colonize various spaces around the globe, the totalitarian attitude of Qing was not interested in major negotiations with “barbaric merchants”. It was not authorized to grant a space of foreign representation in the capital - embassies [III] - and were rarely admitted to the Court in Beijing representatives. When this happened, it was expected to be familiar with the prostration ritual before the emperor [IV].
This prostration ritual is an important detail in the British mission led by George Macartney in 1793 to Beijing to meet Emperor Qianglong. Its purpose was to ask the Qing Empire to respect those who were at the time the minimum international rights of which Europe enjoyed almost all the rest of the world: free trade, permanent embassies and equality of sovereignty. Until then, Europeans had no choice but to reduce the role of supplicants in the Chinese tax order-trade with barbarians was considered no more than a tribute to the Great Empire of the environment. The Macartney Mission was a failure at various levels, as appealing and trying to demonstrate the technical and scientific superiority of the West, could not carry out any of the negotiations that had been ordered to it. This Chinese attitude was particularly offensive to Britain, but China's GDP was even about seven times that of Britain and hence the Emperor considered that it was London who needed help and not the other way around (Maddison, 2006).
The rising western powers would not tolerate a diplomatic mechanism for much longer that referred to them as “barbarians” who paid tribute or a tight seasonal trade regulated in a single port. After the Macartney mission the Britain of the Western civilizational top had been particularly offended.
A single world order
- From trade to peace
With the trade balance unbalanced in the face of Chinese disinterest in British manufactures, the insistence on import without opium restrictions to China was the solution found by them to finally conquer the Chinese market. Opium was introduced illicitly and with the clear purpose of addicting the Chinese population in the only product that could make profits to Britain.
When opium began to circulate in the country, Beijing made an attempt to regulate and sell the product. However, the progressive destruction of populations and public health problems that quickly became visible all over the country led the court to ban their marketing. For a Britain that was beginning to ban the globalization of slavery (of which it had been paradoxically path) in order to affirm its moral superiority before the rest of Europe, the commercialization of opium caused Western a certain sense of embarrassment. But it was not only westernly that opium marketing was seen as an embarrassment. The official agent for opium eradication in China, Lin Zu, even asked Queen Vitória to be in charge of suppressing opium trade not only in China but in the Indian territories of Great Britain from where the deep degradation reports caused by the drug use were already heard all over the world (TSE-HSU, 1839). Lin makes an ultimatum to Britain that threatened to end the export of Chinese products if the British did not end the opium marketing. Certainly the great Chinese empire could not suffer from greater retaliation, the Chinese court underestimated foreign military capabilities already much more developed than the Chinese - which never had to wage great battles after the unification of the empire due to more exquisite ways to call war, such as those that can be studied in the classic art of Sun Tzu war. Centuries of supremacy had distorted the meaning of the reality of the heavenly court. The claim of superiority only accentuated the inevitable humiliation (KISSINGER, 2011).
British commissioner Palmerston writes back to the Chinese court and clearly defends his point of view: Chinese legal systems had, according to western legal principles, labeled a long time ago, so the next step of the British government was to immediately send an armed to block the main Chinese ports, to take 'all the Chinese ships that can be' convenient part of the territory ' Chinese »Until London gets satisfaction. (PALMSSTON, 1840). [V] The results of the interaction between the overwhelming Western force and the typical psychological management of China resulted in two treaties: the Nanjing Treaty and the Bogue Treaty. China had to pay Britain six million dollars of compensation, to give up Hong Kong and open five coastal ports in which Western residence and trade would be allowed (Guangzhou, Ningbo, Shanghai, Xiamen and Fuzhou).
The “Canton System” had come to an end. The British also obtained the right to make direct trade that did not pass by Beijing and the power to exercise jurisdiction over their national residents in the Chinese ports of the treaty. This meant that foreign opium traders would be subject to the laws of their own countries and not China. This principle of "extraterritoriality" eventually represented the decline of imperial power. Following the concessions allowed to Britain, many other Western powers wanted to come to complain about their piece. The mandate of heaven had ended and had been replaced by the western concept of sovereignty.
The Peace Thesis for Trade
The thesis of peace for commerce argues that it reduces the likelihood of armed conflicts between states in a logic of interdependence in which commercial liberalism plays a central role in conducting peace, thus surpassing the conflict logic defended by realistic theorists. The Organization of International Trade (WTO) presents several arguments that underlie the fact that trade between sovereign states leads to peace, namely arguing that traders have less tendency to generate conflicts with their clients (World Trade Organization, 2003: 2); The second argument is that disputes are constructively dealt with in the procedures of institutions and organizations. Liberal peace supporters argue that interdependence reduces conflict because conflict reduces trade. Economic interdependence promotes peace because the conflict is inconsistent with economic ties that promote mutual benefit (Polachek &amp; Xiang, 2008).
The thesis was, however, over time changing the empirical basis. At first time when the essential operating concept is called “comparative advantages”. It is the time of international economic life that has been conceptualized in traditional international trade theories. Each state explores the competitive advantages it has in the international system. Where before we had political units, we now have economic units. From the 80s onwards it becomes a mesh of bilateral relations, thus globalization the loss of this national reference.
The Anglo-Chinese war was presented by the British government as a necessary process in which the ends justified the means. Despite the universally recognized ethical and moral failure of the illegal dissemination of a narcotic view to the forced opening of a state to international trade legislation, the united kingdom's official apology has never been formalized, not even when the recovery of Hong Kong sovereignty by the popular republic of China in 1997. To free trade, invasions and attempts at colonization by the Western powers continued to foster war in China in a logic of expansion of power and sovereignty. 完

In the Chinese capital 82,000 people had to leave their homes, while in Hong Kong streets and a hospital suffered floods and some subway stations were closed
 
Strong rains continue not to give respite, not only in Macau (see page 7), but in Hong Kong and in the interior of the country. In the case of China, Beijing authorities moved more than 82,000 people from home due to torrential rain, a week after deadly floods that led those responsible for recognizing failures in the response, the official news agency Xinhua said yesterday.
Thus, tens of thousands of residents were removed from the most affected areas by rain until 9 pm on Monday, local time, according to the Municipal Flood Response Center. The center warned of the high risk of floods in the districts of Miyun (northwest), Fangshan (southwest), lied (west) and Huairou (north).
The Chinese capital kept in force the red alert-the highest-until yesterday morning, before predictions of heavy rain between Monday and the morning of Tuesday.
Last week, these same rural districts north of Beijing were the most affected by the weather that caused 44 dead and nine missing, according to official data. Most of the deadly victims were registered in a home of elderly in Miyun.
New measures in agriculture
The severity of the catastrophe led municipal authorities to recognize “gaps” in the preparation of emergency services. Natural disasters are frequent in China during summer, with some regions subject to torrential rainfall and others to severe droughts.
However, the Chinese authorities have reinforced the device to respond to the adverse effects of intense rainfall and heat waves on agricultural crops in various regions of the country, at a crucial time for autumn harvesting.
Since the beginning of the rainy season, east and northern China areas have recorded episodes of extreme precipitation, while provinces such as Henan (Center) and Anhui (East) face prolonged periods of drought and high temperatures.
This combination of meteorological phenomena represents a challenge for farmers, especially when about two months left to harvest the main autumn cereals, the official news agency Xinhua yesterday pointed out.
In the province of Shaanxi (Center), where precipitation recently exceeded 100 millimeters in less than 24 hours, local authorities adopted preventive measures such as channel cleaning and reinforcement of dikes, which allowed to protect most of the cultivated lands.
However, Henan agricultural cooperatives affected by drought opted for gout watering systems and localized application of fertilizers to conserve moisture and minimize losses.
Authorities have given priority to the rehabilitation of water infrastructure and the dissemination of efficient water management techniques in the absence of precipitation in some areas. The autumn campaign represents a fundamental component of China's annual cereal production.
In a statement issued yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs warned that weather conditions in the coming weeks will be determining and appealed to "all efforts to protect the harvest and give strong support to the country's food security."
Chinese President Xi Jinping said in 2023 that, although “1,400 million Chinese eat well” currently, “the food issue should not be careless”, stressing that the supply of food “is not an insignificant issue”.
China has less than nine percent of the planet's aurable land, although it represents about 18 percent of the world's population. In the last summers, weather disasters have caused significant damage in the country: the 2023 scirred months were marked by flooding in Beijing, which caused more than 30 dead, while by 2022 several extreme and dried heat waves hit the center and east of China.
Hong Kong on Alert
With regard to the panorama of heavy rains in neighboring territory, they have not given respite either. According to public broadcaster RTHK, some hong Kong stations were closed yesterday due to the risk of flooding, given that the Hong Kong Observatory kept the black signal of storm [Black Rainestorm Warning Signal] until around 17 hours.
Winds of about 110 kilometers per hour were recorded in some areas of the territory, and thunderstorms were also registered. The rthk channel also reveals that more than 10,800 lightnings were counted in the territory between midnight and 10 am yesterday, half of them occurred on Lantau Island.
Until 11 am yesterday, the authorities responsible for the drainage systems recorded 21 episodes of flooding, and 180 emergency responses were made in 240 different locations.
Highlight for the occurrence of an episode at Queen Mary Hospital this Tuesday, namely “on some roads” hospital access in Pok Fu Lam, and patients were displaced by firefighters to Ruttonjee Hospital in the Wanchai area. In some zones of the hospital the water reached the knees, and sand bags were placed to stop the flow of the rains. At about 11 am yesterday this scenario was resolved, with the normal one returning to the Queen Mary Hospital near noon.
The rains also led to the large increase in water level in the Lower Shing Mun reservoir in the Shaan area, which led to the notification of nearby housing complexes, such as Mei Lam Estate, May Shing Court, Mei Chung Court and Granville Garden.
Despite the heavy rains, some people went to work normally doing alternative routes. This was the case of Mak, a woman who, to the RTHK channel, said she had to make a deviation to get to the office. “I couldn't go straight to there and had to make a longer route. The metro [mtr] made some warnings [about the storm and closures], but I would like them to do them in the carriages as well, because I only realized that access was closed when I got to the exit,” he described.
The sun
Information provided by the Hong Kong Observatory speaks of the passage of an active "southwest monsoon and high altitude disturbances that are bringing heavy rainfall and violent thunderstorms to the southern coast of China and the northern part of the southern China Sea."
Yesterday the highest daily precipitation record was broken to August since 1884, upon registered, until 14h, 355.7 millimeters of precipitation at the Observatory's headquarters.
For today time should stay unstable in Hong Kong, with “heavy rains at the beginning” of the day. However, these "should gradually decrease" tomorrow, expected "a lot of heat with sunny periods in the next two days."
Also the Meteorological and Geophysical Services (SMG) leave a heavy rain alert to this day with “frequent, sometimes intense, thunderstorm”. The sun is expected to start appearing at the MSAR from tomorrow, still with some clouds, extending this weather scenario until next Monday. Temperatures should reach 33 degrees.</description><pubDate>2025-08-06 00:29:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Iam | Cats captured due to complaints from the University of Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/05/iam-gatos-capturados-devido-a-queixas-da-universidade-de-macau/</link><description>The collection of cats from the land of the University of Macao resulted from “university complaints about the large amount of cats in its campus,” the institute for municipal affairs told HM. The public body removes, for now, the scenario of slaughtering animals, feared by the students
 
The Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) clarifies that the collection of 15 cats between July 22 and 25 of the University of Macao campus (one) emerged in response to complaints from the institution of higher education in relation to hygiene problems in the campus generated by the presence of animals.
"AMI has constantly receiving complaints from one about the large amount of cats on its campus and food waste that is not removed in time and affecting environmental hygiene," was referred to in the response sent to HM.
UM UM Campus Cats led to a wave of students' indignation, who say Temer the slaughter of animals after the period of complaint and adoption. AMI will move away, this scenario.
"Regarding cats captured, if they are not claimed by the owner after the period of complaint, AMI will implement the policy of" open capture, sterilization and adoption "(TNA), prioritizing finding appropriate adopters for cats. It should be noted that AMI does not set a deadline for retention of the adopted animals."
In the same answer it is said that during the waiting period for host families, AMI “will continue to provide clinical care and daily care to animals, never existing their slaughtering situation due to the term of retention period”.
In this sense, it is explained that AMI veterinarians “are performing a series of medical care that include body examination, vaccine administration and microchips.” In addition, “cats can only be available for adoption after being sterilized,” Iam said.
“Lack of sensitivity”
The warnings for the adoption of these animals continue on social networks, and in a note sent to HM and signed by “a member of the UMERS - UMM groups”, is questioned the “worrying situation” that occurred during the summer vacation and therefore the absence of most students.

“These cats, considered an integral part of the university community, survived the sign of signal 10, but unfortunately they could not escape these AMI capture operations in recent days. For many students and teachers, these cats were like 'veterans' of campus, following them during significant moments of academic life and providing comfort and joy in the university environment.”
The note explains that "UMERS" members cannot adopt cats "due to various circumstances," such as family allergies, possession of other animals, or "additional restrictions" for students in the interior of China.
The alerts on social networks aim to “sensitize the public for this situation and encourage people with adequate conditions to adopt these cats in the municipal Kennel of Macau.
On the Red Note platform there is even the group “A CatStories”, where the stories of cats captured by AMI are shared, and only one publication generated 460 tastes and 160 comments. A group was also created on Facebook, “Macao Cats II”, and there is also publications on Threads, with a total of 500 tastes and 500 shares, including the ten thousand views.
One of the profiles of the "a catstories" concerns a "slight little cat," described as "a" unnamed "file, just created on the computer: still blank, slowly exploring the world and trying to type loose fragments to write" his own story.
“Hurryned to a corner, I watch the people who pass, evaluating who can become an important character of my plot. So far, few people have been written in my story, and I have also left few brands in someone's life. Before leaving the campus maybe this" unnamed "file is only 5kb, registering some timid explorations and a soft desire for human warmth," reads the adoption.
HM questioned one on this subject, given that the animals were being cherished by the students, but until the closing of the edition did not receive an answer. "UMERS" members also question how one can one, "an institution that seeks academic excellence and better classifications in the world rankings, demonstrate such a lack of sensitivity, allowing the capture of these animals without any alternative solution."
Aborted association
In the same grade it is said that students considered creating an association to “organize the sterilization of campus cats, but the university did not approve the creation of such a student association”.
UMERS members enhance “contrast with renowned universities in the interior of China, such as the University of Beijing, where there is a student association dedicated to the care of university campus cats, and at the University of Zhejiang, where UM UM Rector Song Yonghua has previously worked an association to protect university campus animals since 2005”.
Regarding animal collection and treatment actions, AMI says that "TNA policies correspond to the guiding principles of the World Animal Health Organization (WOAH), which contribute to reducing the possibility of stray animals being exposed to disease and facing unfavorable environmental factors."
Such policies also contribute to the reduction of the number of animals "and their excessive long -term reproduction." It is also noted that "TNA policies still take into account the state of survival and welfare of animals, in order to find adopting families for animals with conditions, dedicating themselves to helping them to obtain permanent and stable proper care."
The AMI also says it has "constantly optimized the municipal kennels", and in recent years, "complementary facilities and equipment have been perfected." In addition, there is also cooperation “with animal protection associations”, and joint projects in schools and community neighborhoods for animal adoption and care.
Official data available on the AMI website indicates that in the first quarter of this year 264 animals were captured without microchip, which increased to 280 in the second quarter. The numbers are similar to the first two quarters of 2024: the first were caught 266 animals without microchip, followed by 327 animals in the second quarter. In the third and fourth quarters of last year 258 and 203 animals were caught, respectively.
Regarding sterilization actions, in the first quarter of this year 289 were made, followed by 211 actions of this kind in the second quarter. In the first quarter of this year were claimed, or adopted, 102 cats and 29 dogs, and in the following quarter, 93 cats and 49 dogs were adopted.
As for the number of animals slaughtered, in the first quarter of this year alone 32 cats and 69 dogs were killed. If in cats this number reduced in the second quarter to 11, the same did not happen with the dogs: 101 were slaughtered.</description><pubDate>2025-08-05 01:24:52</pubDate></item><item><title>CCCM | Fusion with Foundation for Science and Technology creates new agency</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/04/cccm-fusao-com-fundacao-para-a-ciencia-e-tecnologia-cria-nova-agencia/</link><description>Operating since 1999, the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center will merge with the Foundation for Science and Technology and the National Innovation Agency, creating a new institution. The practical consequences for the CCCM that aims to promote studies on Macao, China and Asia in Portugal are unknown. The president of the center says it is early to make comments
 
It is not known whether it will maintain its name, the number of scholarships for studies on China, Macao and Asia, or whether to change staff, but what is certain is that the Macao Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) will merge with the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) and the National Innovation Agency. Of these three entities will be born the new agency for research and innovation.
The process is linked to the desire to reform the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology by the Portuguese government led by Luís Montenegro, and the changes were announced on Thursday.
However, there is still no great information about the consequences of this merger to the CCCM. At HM, Carmen Amado Mendes, its president, chose to refer to clarification for the future operation of the center, considering that it is "premature" to give answers about something "that is not yet defined."
On Thursday, Minister Fernando Alexandre announced the reform of the Ministry of Education, Science and Innovation with the extinction of several entities, including FCT that has been the main financier of PhD and other research projects in Portugal.
The reform of the ministry was approved by the Council of Ministers and, at a press conference at the end of the meeting, Fernando Alexandre justified the restructuring by describing his ministry as an “anacronic structure”, with fragmented organizations, disintegrated information systems and disarticulated governance.
With 18 entities and 27 higher leaders between the services of the non -higher education system and higher education, science and innovation, the ministry will have only seven entities and 27 higher leaders, with the integration of extinguished entities into new entities.
Regarding the extinction of the FCT, the minister assured that the financing of science will be preserved, with funding for four years that guarantees stability, predictability and “the protection of the financing of the most basic fundamental investigation”.
“When we started thinking about this reform, we do it with a vision: to ensure equal opportunities to access quality education,” said Fernando Alexandre, also underlining the reinforcement of the education system.
Marcelo can veto
The extinction of FCT has generated some less good reactions in Portugal because it fears a reduction in investment in science and research. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, president of the Portuguese Republic, said he had “the sensation” that the foundation was replaced “with an agency in which he was integrated, and had other functions beyond those of FCT.”
Marcelo acknowledged that the Foundation was a “very old structure” and that “it had many aspects that deserved to be rethought”, but said: “Just seeing what the new agency will do can I answer if this extinction is a good or bad idea.”
As for the eventual 'green light' from Belém, Marcelo said that if he thinks this extinction is "good", promulgates the diploma "without anguish." "If you have doubts about a point that is this diploma that is very important I ask the government to rethink. It has happened. I may not veto soon. If the government insists, I can come to veto, if it is until the end of my mandate," he also admitted.
A history of the transition
The CCCM was born in 1995 during the administration of Vasco Rocha Vieira, the last Portuguese governor of Macao, intending to be “a place of excellence for the dissemination of Macau, its history, its culture and its economy”, reads in the memories of Rocha Vieira, “to all the ports I arrived”.
This entity, operating in the Alcântara area, in Lisbon, was inaugurated in November 1999 by the then President of the Republic, Jorge Sampaio, and had as first president Alexandra Costa Gomes.
On the CCCM website it is read that the institution is endowed with administrative autonomy and its own heritage, being a public institute integrated in the indirect administration of the state and under the tutelage of the Ministry of Education, Science and Innovation.
In the objective booklet, it is read that the CCCM “has as its mission to produce, promote and disseminate knowledge about Macao as a platform between Portugal and the Popular Republic of China, as well as between Europe and Asia”, also presenting itself as “a space dedicated to the study and teaching of Chinese language, culture and history”. The center has also been established as "a center for scientific research and continuous and advanced training on the relations between Portugal and China, as well as between Europe and Asia."
After the long presidency of Luís Filipe Barreto, academic at the University of Lisbon, the CCCM began to be chaired, from February 2020, by Carmen Amado Mendes. The leader recently saw her service committee renewed by 2030.
A few months after taking office as president, Carmen Amado Mendes presented, on September 18, 2020, the new “Strategic Development Plan of the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center 2020-2030”.
Since then, the CCCM has awarded dozens of doctoral scholarships for the studies of Macao, China and Asia, and the “Spring Conferences”, which bring together academic performances around the same themes every year. Also noteworthy that the CCCM opened, in December last year, the “Gallery of Governors”, with 41 paintings of the former Portuguese governors of Macao. A new building that houses the file and library was also inaugurated.
This plan sets objectives by 2030, "the reinforcement of scientific and cultural cooperation in the domain of past understanding, present and future trends of relations between Europe and Asia."
With regard to archives, it is intended to “modernize and dynamization within a network of documentation centers and international reference file on euro-seatic themes, with emphasis on the various files in Lisbon, but also in Portugal and Europe”.
Given that the CCCM houses, in its facilities, the Macao Museum, the board points to the “insertion and appreciation in the museum network at the level of Lisbon and National”.
The central idea of the plan was to develop, by 2030, “CCCM facilities as a pole of streamlining scientific, cultural and economic relations between Portugal and China, including the installation of entities such as the Luso-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Erasmus+Youth Entrepreneurs Association, as well as research nuclei in eurical studies”. It remains to be seen if, with the merger, all these initiatives will continue their initial course.</description><pubDate>2025-08-04 07:39:48</pubDate></item><item><title>USJ | Researchers discover a new species of bacteria in Portugal</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/08/usj-investigadores-descobrem-nova-especie-de-bacteria-em-portugal/</link><description>A team of local university researchers identified a new species of bacteria in the Salinas of Rio Maior, Portugal. The type of discovered organism, which lives in extreme environments, widens the limits of biological knowledge and may have implications in areas such as biomedicine, pharmacy or even spatial exploration
 
There is news in the field of microbiology thanks to the latest discovery of a team of researchers linked to the University of São José (USJ), led by André Antunes, interim director of the Institute of Sciences and Environment of the same educational institution.
It is the discovery of a new species of bacteria from 12 samples collected in the Salinas of Rio Maior, in Portugal, which led to the establishment of the new species “Fodinibius alkaliphilus”. The species of bacteria previously known as “Alifodinibius salipaludis” for “Fodinibius salipaludis” was also reclassified.
The conclusions appear in the article “Fodinibius alkaliphilus sp. Nov., Moderately halophilic and alkaliphilic bacterium isolated from an Inland Saltern in central and reclassification of aliifodinibius salipaludi as fodinibius salipalis sp. SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY. The scientific journal is a publication “reference for new macrobial data”, being the official publication of the International Procaryotes Systematic Committee and the Applied Bacteriology and Microbiology Division of the International Union of Microbiological Societies, describes a USJ note.
In addition to André Antunes, the authors team includes researchers from the University of Science and Technology of Macau, coordinated by Marta Filipa Simões; Researchers at the University of Minho and Seville University.
According to the same USJ note, "the new [bacteria] species grows better in salinities about four times higher than those of seawater and also prefers alkaline conditions, combining the ability to grow in different extreme environmental conditions."
The importance of this type of studies, including analyzes to “such extreme environments”, is “future applications in a wide range of fields, including biomedical and pharmaceutical, but also extends to the discovery of new useful materials and the provision of useful information for future space exploration”.
The same team of investigators is not stopped, as "other samples of these places are currently being investigated and new publications describing other new species are expected in the coming months."
“This publication highlights the strengths of Macao in articulation with partners from Portuguese and Spanish -speaking countries, as well as its growing importance in the fields of biodiversity and biotechnology,” is still described.
The Power of Salinas
The researchers explain that "the species Aliifodinibius Salipaludis has been described, but their name has not yet been validly published." In field work the team isolated these species from “hypersaline environments, including saline, salt mines and saline soils”.
Prior to the field work itself, the team conducted “an investigation to the microbial diversity of hypersaline environments in downtown Portugal”, with samples in the Rio Maior area in July 2019, 12 genera bacteria were isolated from the Rio Maior salines.
Located in the central area of Portugal, in these Salinas there is the “brine, which is about seven times more salty than seawater”, being “pumping from a well and generated by the crossing of a local underground course with an extensive salt deposit”.
The article also gives a historical context of this location. "Although they were first referred to in twelfth-century documents, these places are believed to have been linked to salt extraction from prehistoric times. They offer a single scenario, as they are the only interior saline in Portugal and the only ones in full functioning throughout Europe."
Thus, the study in question "was part of a bioprospecting campaign centered on this place", resulting in "in the isolation of a bacterial strain (N2T) and the discovery of a new putative species within the genus Fodinibius."
In this work is determined “the taxonomic position of this new isolated based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonos and molecular properties”, is described.
Importance for Science
At HM, André Antunes explained that this discovery is, first of all, interesting to the scientific community, by bringing “additional information” and constituting a discovery “about the biodiversity that exists on our planet, more concretely at the macrobial level”.
"So far, we have been able [general scientific community] to study less than 1 percent of all microbes species on the planet. In over 99 percent we have no idea what they are, what they do and what their abilities, or what impact on the environment and our lives," he explained.
The researcher also said that "the microbes that come from extreme environments, and above all from environments with a lot of salt, which is the case of this species we now discover, are very interesting for a large range of biotechnology applications."
"We can include things like the medical area, biomedicine, the production of new pharmaceutical compounds or the production of new biomaterials, such as bioplastics," said André Antunes. The academic even talks about applications in “more exotic areas, which are now beginning to have a little more visibility, such as the potential application in construction, the production of more sustainable cements or concrete structures that have the self -repair capacity”.
This discovery also has some impact "for space exploration, more specifically to better understand what the limits of life are and where to seek life outside our planet." It is also included "very important implications for missions that are exploring Mars, namely as to the type of environments where it may be feasible to find past signs of life or present or other parts of the solar system."
A job that continues
The investigation is not for the Salinas of Rio Maior, and the team led by André Antunes last year, an expedition to Antarctica. “There are antarctic samples that we are currently studying and we have samples taken from the red sea bottom, where salt concentration is also quite high.” Therefore, the saga of discovering new bacteria and potential reclassifications in those that already exist.
André Antunes says that the discovery of a new species of microbes "is quite important to science, not only for the perspective of science at the basic level, but because we can have a better perspective of diversity we have on the planet."
“As we study extreme environments we can have additional information about what the limits of life are and how life adapts to extreme conditions.” Thus, André Antunes advocates investment in science so that there is later “an associated practical component, so it is not always easy to convince the financing entities”, as to this point.
The researcher also points out that the article and the investigation fits “very well in the priorities of Macau and the USJ itself, with regard to the focus in the area of environment, biodiversity and biotechnology, anchored in connection with Lusophony”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-08 00:04:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Australia | Great Coral Barrier has been declining since there is a record</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/07/australia-grande-barreira-de-coral-sofre-maior-declinio-desde-que-ha-registo/</link><description>The Great Barrier of Choir, with 2,300 kilometers long, off the Australian East, has been suffering the largest coral decline since registrations began in 1986, a yesterday report published.
The Australian Institute of Marine Sciences of the Government, documented the condition of 124 reefs between August 2024 and May 2025 to determine the widespread coral bleaching in the three sections of the Greater Barrier.
The impact is higher in the northern areas (Cape York to Cooktown), with a 24.8 percent decline compared to the 2024, and southern levels (proserpine to gladstone), with 30.6 percent, representing these two values “the largest annual decline in coral cover” in 39 years.
In the central region (cooktown to proserpine), the decline recorded is 13.9 percent compared to last year. The last episode of bleaching on site, declared UNESCO's World Heritage Site, has a "high to extreme" prevalence in all three areas, scientists find in the report.
“Individual reefs registered a decline of corals of up to 70.8 percent” near Lizard Island in the North Zone, it refers to the study. The death of the corals, manifested by its bleaching, is caused by the impact of water heating - temperatures were recorded one to 2.5 degrees Celsius above average during the southern summer of 2025 - associated with the climate crisis.
The large coral barrier “experienced unprecedented levels of thermal stress, resulting in the most extensive and severe bleaching that there is registration to date”, read in the document, in reference to the phenomenon that occurred in 2024 and continued during the first months of this year.
The Australian agency warns that the habitat can reach “a point of non -return”, where the choir cannot recover sufficiently quickly between catastrophic events.</description><pubDate>2025-08-07 00:22:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Economic Report Highlights Startup “Historical Record”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/06/hong-kong-relatorio-economico-destaca-recorde-historico-de-startups/</link><description>"Hong Kong's startups are on the rise." This is how the executive in the neighboring region describes the business environment in the region, where they were created in 2024 about 4,700 startups, plus 10 percent of 2023. In the “Report of Hong Kong's Business Environment 2025” reads that the territory is far from losing economic competitiveness
 
The Hong Kong government released last July 30 the latest report on the neighboring region's economic scene. And one of the highlights is given to the scenario of growth of entrepreneurship.
In the “Report of Hong Kong’s Business Environment 2025” [Hong Kong 2025 Business Environment Report] it is noteworthy that “Startups in Hong Kong are on the rise”, given that last year there were “about 4,700 startups in the city, a historic record and an increase of 10 percent from the previous year”.
The document explains that "more than a quarter of these startups has founders from outside Hong Kong," it is companies that operate in a "broad spectrum of sectors, including Fintech [High Technology], Electronic Trade and Information, Informatics and Technology", having hired more than 17,000 people. This number of human resources also represents an increase of seven percent compared to 2023. "All this is proof of Hong Kong's strong appeal for startup entrepreneurs," the authorities highlight.
But it is not only startups that record growth, with the report to point out that the current government, led by executive head John Lee, "achieved remarkable results in attracting companies, investments and talents."
"For example, in 2024, the number of companies in Hong Kong with headquarters outside the territory increased significantly by about 10 percent, reaching almost 10,000." The “Office for the attraction of strategic companies, created more than two years ago, attracted 84 strategic companies to establish or expand their business in Hong Kong, including companies with market capitalization or valuation of over $ 10 billion, involving cutting -edge technology”, it is added.
The report also points out that between January 2023 and the first half of this year, Invest Hong Kong, linked to the Raehk government's direct foreign investment department, "helped over 1300 foreign and continent companies establishing or expanding their business in Hong Kong, bringing investments of over $ 160 billion."
Still with regard to Invest Hong Kong, the entity helped "539 companies from the continent or foreign to establish or expand their business in Hong Kong, which represents an annual growth of over 40 percent."
At the end of June this year, Hong Kong had 1.5 million local companies, while the total number of companies not registered in Hong Kong reached 15 509. "Both numbers represent historical records," it reads, and for the government of the neighboring territory the data "demonstrate the great confidence that continent and abroad companies have in the future of Hong Kong."
Given that Hong Kong also has a talent capture program, the Hong Kong Talent Engage, reads in the report that by June this year "were received about 500,000 candidates in the shelter of various talent admission programs, of which about 330,000 were approved." Of these numbers, Hong Kong actually arrived to work 220,000 qualified frames.
Good scholarship scenario
Quoted on an official press release, a government spokesman stated that "in a complex and volatile external environment, Hong Kong is undergoing a phase of economic update and transformation, but there are more opportunities than challenges."
Given that the territory has always positioned itself as a strong financial market worldwide, this scenario seems to have recorded a recovery in recent years.
“This year Hong Kong's financial market performance has been constantly improving. The Hang SENG Index has a 18 percent increase last year and an increase of more than 25 percent this year so far. The average daily business volume in the first half of the year was about $ 240 billion, with an increase of about 120 percent.”
Authorities highlight the maintenance of the economic competitiveness of the territory, pointing out that "over the years Hong Kong has been constantly classified as a global leader in economic freedom and competitiveness."
Attention to the trade war
In conclusion, the Raehk government clarifies that the territory seems to maintain economic stability in times of constant commercial conflicts, with Donald Trump threatening and imposing tariffs on a number of countries.
“As volatile and turbulent as the world may be, we remain firmly committed to the rules -based multilateral commercial system, with the WTO [World Trade Organization] as a nucleus, while actively participating and supporting regional economic cooperation.”
The “numerous advantages of Hong Kong” are referred to, with its “highly internationalized business environment, a flexible and solid financial system, a simple and secure tax regime with low tax rates and a robust and independent legal system”.
However, in the document it is also stressed that the “tariff war caused a global reallocation of capital”, and Hong Kong wants to bet on the attraction of “foreign companies and capital” to the region.
The report also tells that "international organizations and foreign trade chambers in Hong Kong are confident in the future perspectives" of the territory, and that for the authorities "there is no reason to worry about some excessively pessimistic feelings."
"In fact, the Raehk government is creating a new momentum and expanding the ability to support Hong Kong's economic growth, thus increasing its overall competitiveness and achieving high quality development," is still added.
The executive spokesman also established a parallelism between good economic situation and political stability. "In recent years, the implementation of the National Security Law has restored a stable social environment in Hong Kong. This not only protected the rights and freedoms of the general public, but also made Hong Kong a safe haven to attract international capital and investment," he concluded. The report was presented by the secretary for Hong Kong finances, Paul Chan.</description><pubDate>2025-08-06 23:29:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Portuguese knight bets on the formation of competition horses in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/cavaleiro-portugues-aposta-na-formacao-de-cavalos-de-competicao-na-china/</link><description>Report by João Pimenta, Agência Lusa
Step, trot and gallop: On a farm outside Beijing, Portuguese João Ruas training six horses daily to the practice of Dressage, an equestrian Olympic discipline that seeks to expose the maximum of the animal's athletic capabilities.
“It's a very very relationship,” he described to Lusa the Knight, a native of Lisbon. "There are days when we are almost like a father to teach the son, others where it is the horse that teaches us to us. But there must always be mutual respect," he said.
Ruas, de 28 anos, chegou à China há um ano para criar seis cavalos e dar formação em dressage numa quinta em Shunyi, o distrito no nordeste de Pequim onde as aldeias e campos agrícolas lembram mais o interior da China do que a capital de 22 milhões de habitantes.
Ten kilometers from the Huairou reservoir, a 12 -kilometer artificial lake that supplies Beijing and regulates the flow of local rivers, the fifth is surrounded by watercourses, tree -lined slopes, corn fields and natural reserves.
On the horizon, the mountainous chains that rise to the north of the Changing and Huairou districts complete a landscape that contrasts with the tangle of glazed torres and apartments blocks of Beijing's urban network. “When I'm here I don't remember if I'm in China, Portugal or Germany,” explained João Ruas. "I'm in a bubble, let's say, and it's a good bubble."
Without previous experience in the country, the Portuguese was surprised by the sympathy of the Chinese and the reception of the local community. On the day he was interviewed by the Lusa agency, his cargo tricycle advocated on his way to the supermarket. Depressing the neighbors quickly sent to try to fix the vehicle.
“I am the only foreigner here. I communicate for gestures, I am still learning Chinese, but I have always been very well treated. The neighbors help in everything,” he said.
Despite the enthusiasm with life in the countryside, the coach admits difficulties in the exercise of the sport he has been practicing since he was nine years old. "There is a lot of amateurism, little technique, expensive and poorly frequency evidence. And everything that involves horses here is frankly more expensive than in Europe."
The horse “is not dominated by force: it requires patience, knowledge and sensitivity,” he said. "It's like an athlete. There are good days and bad days. And don't speak. We have to know how to read the signs. A small reaction may indicate a serious problem," he noted.
In Portugal, João Ruas studied at the D. Dinis Agricultural Professional School, where he reconciled classes for last weekends with the coach. Since then, it never left the horses. "I started with once a week, then two, then three, until I got to five. I had to insist a lot with my parents to start," he said.
In China, he works with European horses, brought on purpose to compete in Dressage evidence. The goal is to prepare animals since the age of three for competitions that normally start at four. "There is still a tradition of creation with sports focus. Horses have been raised for many years, but not with selective criterion for sport," he said.
Shanghai, the country's economic “capital”, leads the practice of drassage in the country, with more proof and better infrastructure. In Beijing, there is a growing interest, but there is still a long way to go. “It can be good to start like this, almost from scratch. It allows you to do things well. Without addictions,” reflected streets.
With the arrival of another horse soon and the prospect of continuing work in China, João Ruas is said. "I see myself here for many more years. It only costs the distance. But with today's technology, we managed to shorten it," he said. "There are sacrifices that are good for the soul."</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:54:44</pubDate></item><item><title>Traffic | Law returns to stake zero and moves to the next legislature</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/transito-lei-volta-a-estaca-zero-e-passa-para-proxima-legislatura/</link><description>The revision of the Traffic Law returned to the drawer and the legislative process will have to start over in the new legislature. Under discussion since the government of Chui Sai On, the law returns to Estaca Zero, after the deputies concluded that the diploma was unable to be voted before the end of the seventh legislature
 
The revision of the road traffic law crossed the legislative agendas of Chui Executives Sai On, Ho Iat Seng and returned to the drawer in the first year of Sam Hou Fai at the head of the government.
Last Friday, the Legislative Assembly (AL) table released a deliberation, signed by the Al, Kou Hoi In, where it is indicated that “the proposed law entitled 'Road Traffic Law' does not gather the requirements for voting by the plenary”. It is added that "after the term of this legislature, the government can renew the initiative when it understands timely."
At the end of Chui's term Sai On, the government eventually removed the law from the agenda after demonstrations against the increase in fines. Following the extinction of demonstrations in the streets of Macao, the reform of the legislation that regulates traffic returned to the legislative agenda of the Ho IAT SENG Executive, but once again did not complete the process.
Almost two decades after its entry into force in October 2007, the law has been the subject of many criticism and promises of updating.
This time, the AL table indicates that the parliamentary committee responsible for analyzing in the specialty the law had August 7 as the initial period of appreciation set, a period that was extended until August 15, last Friday. In the two months preceding the end of the deadline, and the work of this legislature, Kou Hoi In will have contacted the government several times to be aware of the progress of the proposal.
Age of reason
Despite the contacts of the AL, the 1st Permanent Commission that analyzed the diploma, chaired by Ella Law, did not receive “the formal and conclusive alternative version and the work text and the initial version of the bill are immature”, is described in the text signed by Kou Hoi In.
The opinion signed by the deputies of the 1st Permanent Commission highlights that 23 meetings were held to discuss the diploma in the specialty, 14 of which with the participation of government representatives. However, the complexity of the diploma eventually dictated its "death" in the specialty. The government proposed the revocation of 39 legal diplomas, including the current road traffic law, “which implied a large legislative planning.”
The opinion points out that “taking into account the divergence of general public opinions on the changes of the law proposal, it is necessary to continue to seek consensus”, and that “the government has not yet answered the issues of the commission” and that the “new work text continues to present some problems of principle”.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:31:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Journalism | Ron Lam stop writing opinion for Son Pou</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/jornalismo-ron-lam-deixa-de-escrever-opiniao-para-o-son-pou/</link><description>Deputy Ron Lam decided to stop writing an opinion for the Son Pou newspaper, something he had been doing since 2017.

Ron Lam said it is at a stage when he needs to change his career, so it is "time to end this column." The deputy also explained that the opinion column functioned as a kind of record of his political work, in which he analyzed various policies and measures of the executive from his perspective.
The official said that, in recent times, the opinion articles have ceased to be in vogue, being replaced by the proliferation of short -term videos on social networks, weakening of the most traditional media or the explosion of information. However, Ron Lam always wanted to document the history and context for some government policies, as well as explain advantages and disadvantages, so that the interested public could know the general aspects of some more specific subjects.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:29:53</pubDate></item><item><title>Higher Education | CE gathers with Chinese Education Minister</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/ensino-superior-ce-reune-com-ministro-da-educacao-chines/</link><description>Sam Hou Fai, chief executive, gathered last Thursday at the headquarters of the Government, with China Minister Huai Jinpeng, and the contours of the Futura University City project to develop in Hengqin was discussed with local higher education institutions, which will be named “City (University) of International Education of Macau and Hengqin”.

On Friday, Sam Hou Fai offered a dinner to all the deputies of the 7th Legislature, which will end at the first meeting (in mid-October) of the new cast of legislators found in the next legislative elections. The Chief Executive toasted the deputies with praise and highlighted the successes achieved by the deputies, who "provide solid foundations for the new legislature", in the effective safeguard "of the constitutional order of the Misrece established by the Constitution and the Basic Law".
According to a statement issued by the Social Communication Office, the ruler stressed that the deputies ensured “the effective and smooth functioning of the structure with the predominance of the Executive Power established by the Basic Law, always supported, collaborated and supervised the government in governance according to the law, effectively exercised the powers and functions attributed by the basic law”.
Among the “fruitful results” of legislative work, Sam Hou Fai highlighted the “modernization of the legal system of masters”, namely the improvement of the legal regime of state security defense.
All deputies participated in dinner, including those who are leaving. One of them was Ron Lam, who despite the compliments of Sam Hou Fai about the safeguard “of the constitutional order of the Mand to be established by the Constitution and the Basic Law”, was disqualified from the next elections allegedly because it is not true to MSAR and the Basic Law.
In due place
In total, during the four years of activity, the seventh legislature deputies approved 86 laws. In addition, Sam Hou Fai praised the works of deputies to “raise the governing capacity of mashes, the development of the proper diversification of the economy”, as well as me important areas for the well-being of the population.
The chief executive indicated that in the last four years, the operation of the Legislative Assembly (AL) has provided "three important experiences and inspirations." The first was to ensure the firm implementation of the “Macao governed by Patriotas” principle. The second was the correct fulfillment of AL's functions and responsibilities to ensure the smooth functioning of the structure with the predominance of the executive branch. ” The third was the continuity of improving legislative efficiency and quality “to ensure the legal compliance of Macau's environment and prestige to the environment and prestige in law”.
Finally, Sam Hou Fai said he hoped Kou Hoi In, Chui Sai Cheong and deputies who will leave office soon will continue to support the government in governance according to the law and contribute to efforts and suggestions for the development, prosperity and stability of the long run.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:26:04</pubDate></item><item><title>SS | More than 120 thousand inspections to alcohol and tobacco in six months</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/15/ss-mais-de-120-mil-inspeccoes-a-alcool-e-tabaco-em-seis-meses/</link><description>Health Services Inspectors (SS) performed, in six months, ie, between January and June this year, a total of 123,085 inspections to night establishments to verify compliance with the law in alcohol and tobacco consumption.

Regarding the control of alcoholic beverages, between January and June 2025, there were 11 suspected cases of violation of the prevention and control of alcohol consumption by minors, and three of these cases involved the sale or availability of alcoholic beverages to minors.</description><pubDate>2025-08-15 16:11:44</pubDate></item><item><title>RON LAM | Last episode of the podcast highlighted lack of government responses</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/15/ron-lam-ultimo-episodio-do-podcast-destacou-falta-de-respostas-do-governo/</link><description>The last episode of the podcast held by the Macau Synergy Association, directed by still deputy Ron Lam, was recorded this Wednesday night and highlighted the absence of answers from the executive to the population. The project, which lasted eight years, came to an end, with Ron Lam admitting tiredness
 
Eight years ago the Macao Synergy Association, whose vice president is Deputy Ron Lam, released political ideas through a weekly podcast. However, this was over, having recorded the last episode on Wednesday.
One of the ideas left by Ron Lam was precisely the absence of government responses to the population, fearing that they continue to ignore the voices of society.
The official stressed that Macau synergy has made several proposals over the years to various problems in the territory, but that the government has never accepted or heard these ideas. "We have made every effort to make concrete suggestions and some are expected by the population. Why are young people confused about the future? Why are society's perceptions? These issues have to be faced by the government so that they can solve them," said Ron Lam.
One of the cases described in the last episode of the podcast concerns urbanism, namely the viaduct project between zone A and zone B of new urban landfills. "In the middle of last year we started talking about it, putting questions about the viaduct, but the government always said the viaduct was not going to be like a building. Then the project was eventually suspended by UNESCO requirement," he added.
Unrestrained
Johnson Ian, former Journalist and President of the Association, recalled that, looking at perspective, many of the problems pointed out in eight years of podcast have not been solved. "The themes have always been discussed, namely the housing issues. The second most discussed theme was the light meter. We have been discussing eight years ago, and now we continue to do so," he said.
The interveners said the podcast emerged as a way to explain government policies and other news in detail to listeners, and was a tool to prepare elections to the Legislative Assembly (AL) of 2017.
In the last episode Ron Lam was also questioned by a listener about a possible return to politics through the Federation of Macao Workers' Associations, which he belonged to before creating the Macao Synergy Association to recover the qualification as a candidate. But he pushed this possibility away.
“I won't think of an application for AL in the near future. For me, the deputy's role is a tool for change, and when this tool cannot be used, it is no longer an objective.”
Ron Lam also said that he established for himself the maximum limit of three legislatures at work as a deputy, recalling that he has been in politics since 2010. Now it seems to be time to leave the stage. "I'm tired and I need the time to breathe," he revealed.</description><pubDate>2025-08-15 16:07:49</pubDate></item><item><title>1st Trade Fair in Dili attracts investments from Macau and China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/15/1a-feira-de-comercio-em-dili-atrai-investimentos-de-macau-e-china/</link><description>Dili, capital of Timor-Leste, is preparing to receive the first edition of the Dili International Trade Fair, which will feature 19 businessmen from Macau. The information appears in a note released by the Macau Forum, signed by António Ramos da Silva, delegate of the country with the permanent secretariat of the Macao Forum.
The event, which will take place between August 28 and September 1, is the first of this nature in the country and “intends to attract more investors from the Great Bay (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau) and entrepreneurs from all sectors, from commerce, services, financial institutions and bank”. Macau participates with a delegation of 19 entrepreneurs, organized by the Institute for the Promotion of Investment and Commerce (IPIM), while China sends a delegation of 14 entrepreneurs from various regions, organized by the China Macao Natural Industry Association.
Coffee and company
According to the same note, “During the event the companies of Macau and Guangdong will sign cooperation protocols and purchase and sale contracts with Timor-Leste companies” in areas such as coffee and shellfish production or construction, among others. One of the highlighted examples is the contract between Macau Coffee, a limited company and Timor Global, a coffee distributing company in Timor-Leste, which will have the global value of 808,800.00 US dollars.
Already the company Água Nova de Timor (Macau) will sign an agreement with the Ministry of Education of Timor-Leste “to install drinking water machines in public schools” in the country, read. Another highlight is the agreement signed in this event between the Top Builder, Macao and Huafa Group, Zhuhai, “to participate in the development of infrastructure in Timor-Leste”.
António Ramos da Silva also points out that from the Greater Bay area, investments in Timor-Leste are expected, namely Caizi Group's investment in partnership with Leong Iu Kau, from the Zhuhai Deguang Electronic Products Factory Co, Ltd group. The same note reports that in January this year Caizi Group "signed a pre-agreement of investment with the Timor-Leste [Macao Forum] delegate in a total amount of investment of about 1,000 million US dollars, and that is divided into several phases." It intends to build “integrated resorts, manufacturing factories for construction and other industries”, is mentioned.</description><pubDate>2025-08-15 16:06:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Eternal beatas</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/beatas-eternas/</link><description>No, I will not write about the beatas who frequent the sacristies of the churches and who are insinuated with the priests to provoke sex, because this would give a very controversial chronicle and I won't be there. I come to emphasize what is happening from north to south by all the cities, villages and villages of this country about the cigarettes consumed by smokers.
Cigarette beatas take between 10 to 12 years to deteriorate in nature never to decompose in full. And if the beatas filters are plastic, the beatas take over 100 years to disappear. During this period, the beatas release toxic chemicals in the soil and water, contaminating the environment and impairing wild and urban life. We no longer consider the fact that smokers harm their health, each makes the decision they want. But smokers have to compete in this severe fact that the beasts are thrown to the floor or water.
In any town, village or village we can see Blessed on the floor. Are to the millions. We well know that some coffees do not put ashtrays on the terraces of the terraces, although there are already people who have their reduced dimension grades to put their beatas who later throw the trash. Often citizens are walking the streets, passing their own container to put the beatas and throw them to the ground. They are abroad of a bar in the conversation and shoot the beatas to the floor. They are boating and shoot the beatas to the water. They go to the beach and put the beatas in the sand or throw them into the sea. They are driving a car smoking and in the end shoot the beatas through the window with grant in the car. They are in a picnic in forest zone and throw the beatas anywhere, forgetting the danger of starting a fire. The streets are full of millions of beatas. In conversation with a municipal worker who cleans the streets, he told us that it is virtually impossible to collect all the beatas because some are among the sidewalk stones.
Blessed are a serious damage to the environment and the health of humans. Most smokers have to compensate that they have to change their habit of throwing the beatas to the ground or the waters of a river or sea. It is a gesture of civility and solidarity for the health of others if the smokers do not put the beatas in their own containers. It seems to be a fact of less importance, but it is not. Seriously is millions of beatas through the open -air streets. An environmental matters expert has conveyed to us that one of the worst health of the health of the streets is the existence of thousands of Beatas in their city, village or village. This paradigm is important that it is gradually changed and that smokers stop shooting the beatas where they should not.
According to the Continental Portugal Monitoring Program promoted by the Portuguese Environment Agency, in 2022, the Beatas and the Cigarette Filters occupied third place in the top 10 of the marine waste, corresponding to 13.1% of all caught trash. Read well: It is estimated that 7000 beatas to the ground is estimated. The cigarette beatas are the remaining part after the cigarettes are smoked. They are made up of tobacco remains and a filter. Tobacco remains contain about 4000 chemicals, of which more than 50 are proven carcinogens. They will tell me that they know 80-year-old smokers and smoke one pack a day and have not caught cancer. And we responded that smokers have already died, 40 and 50, and that doctors diagnosed that the contracted cancer was due to tobacco.
It turns out that filters include a central part of cellulose acetate (a synthetic fiber that looks like cotton, but consists essentially of plastic and hence the possibility of being able to get 100 years to undo), involved in two layers of paper or other synthetic fibers. While the cigarette is smoked, the filters accumulate part of the pollutants present in the smoke. When the beasts degrade, filters free these pollutants, such as nicotine and heavy metals such as iron and copper. A cigarette beat can contaminate up to six liters of water. We think it is a serious matter and to take into account, that we cannot continue to shoot with the beasts to the floor or water. It is an appeal that we leave to potential smokers, who think twice before we get rid of the Beata who have their fingers. To the floor, the river or the sea, please, no!
P. S. - Our solidarity for how many in Macao were harmed by the recent and serious floods that were recorded in the MSAR.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:56:53</pubDate></item><item><title>A very cold winter fears</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/15/teme-se-um-inverno-muito-frio/</link><description>After sending the article “Mega-Terramoto” to Jornal Hoje Macau, I received the news that Ron Lam U Tou, a current deputy of the Legislative Assembly, had been disqualified this year for the race to the 8th Legislative Election for direct suffrage. I thought that as Ron Lam U Tou had passed in the evaluation of the Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal) for the 7th election to the Legislative Assembly in 2021, and taking into account his performance as a deputy over four years, and his conduct, also as columnist for a certain journal, everything would be normal.
A columnist for a local newspaper even declared, before learning the disqualification of Lam U Tou, “the“ power of synergy power ”list has strong possibilities to elect two deputies in scrutiny of 2025. In fact, many believe that. Ian Heng Ut, the second candidate on the list 'power of synergy', is skilled, pragmatic and in depth and in detail his arguments. Lam was removed from the race for direct suffrage, the 3,729 votes he had received could be displaced to the 'Macao Synergy Association'.
I thought that after the “mega-terramoto” that shook Macao's political scene in 2021, society would resume stability. Unexpectedly, four years later, they felt "replicas", which raised questions about the impact of "shock waves" on Macao's political stability and causing subsequent changes on society, which I believe will be revealed soon.
At the end of my article “Another misfortune”, I stated that “avoiding misfortunes is the responsibility of all. National security is fundamental, but citizens 'rights and obligations should not be neglected.' Unexpectedly, a few days ago, the Judicial Police said they were investigating the first case of threat to national security, provided that the“ law relating to state security defense ”was promulgated in 2009.
As the case moved to the Public Prosecution Service to continue to be investigated and, respecting the secret of justice, I do not intend to follow the example of certain columnists or comment on this excess case. We must have faith in the law, and Macao, to be governed by the rule of law, is based on the successful and stable implementation of the principle "one country, two systems."
Recently, Macau has been affected by extreme weather conditions, and the black signal of heavy rain has been lifted following the passage of the “Wipha” tropical storm.  The onset of chikungunya virus and fever caused by the type 2 dengue virus (DENV-2) has caused intense efforts to control mosquito plagues in the MSAR. Given the unusual heat that is felt in Macau, it cannot be discarded that after the canulum next winter becomes colder than usual. With luck, this forecast will prove inaccurate.</description><pubDate>2025-08-15 16:36:52</pubDate></item><item><title>The American Pope (III)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/14/o-papa-americano-iii/</link><description>"To All of You, Brothers and Sisters of Rome, Of Italy, Of The Whole World, We Want To Be A Synodal Cast, Church That Walks, Church That Always Seeks Peace, That Always Seeks Charity."
Pope Leo XIV
Instead, all totalitarian states are incompatible with the Gospel, because they deny the nature of power. Transferred to the present day, "the commitment of the Christian in the state is to desecrate political power to overcome the Constantinian era that had sacrailized power."
Here we are, precipitated today. Because the continuity and discontinuity between Francisco and Leão XIV, the Jesuit and the Augustinian, the approach of ecclesiastical geopolitics and the commitment of the Holy See, part of the dialectical drama between the powers, will be measured. And among those without power.
Everything revolves around Constantine. The emperor who legitimizes believers in Jesus presides in Niceia the first ecumenical council (325), of which the Nicene-Constantinopolitan creed that provisionally appeases the disputes around the nature of the Son. Not that the Milvian Bridge winner, under the sign of Christ, cultivates theological interests.
The disputes about divinity bore it. Bagatelas, but that must be calmed in the name of the unity of the Empire and the Church, his Instrumentum Regno, gathered under his command. Constantine dies Christian in his last breath, when an Ariano priest baptizes him according to the rite repudiated by the dying.
For various orthodox and eastern rite churches, this emperor is holy. Not to the Catholic, where there is still a division between those who worship it almost as a saint (as is the case of Paul VI and Benedict XVI) and those who consider him a bad example of power worship, a serious sin.
The two schools face the Second Vatican Council. A strong theological and episcopal current shakes, but does not break the Constantinian taboo. That is, the union between the sacralization of politics and the politicization of theology represented in the mosaic of Santa Pudês. The “Pantocrator God” that blesses the Christian Roman Empire inaugurates the lineage of cesaropapism, with the sovereign who controls religious authority, and its twin twin, papoceastery or theocracy, where clericalized time rules the worldly spirit.
It will be necessary more than a century to shake, not dissolve, the primacy of the neoconstantinian clergy, frightened by the French Revolution to the point of reacting with anti -liberal encyclical and exquisitely reactionary, such as the encyclical “Mirari Vos” (1832) of Gregory XVI and “how cure with the Annex Syllabus Errorum” by Pius IX (1864) «The Church must be separated from the state and the state of the Church” (§ 55). Almost like the Count of Cavour communicating.
This time ex Cathedra by Vatican I license, which on July 18, 1870, with the Italians at the doors, dogmatizes and circumscribes the infallibility of the Roman pontiff. It will be necessary to shake the tree of Constantinism, unable to start it.
The radical distinction between state and church proposed by him has an immediate target, America of the first Trump, rebuked by "New Constantine". According to his most intimate exegetes, Bergoglio "radically rejects the idea of the implementation of the kingdom of God on earth, which had been the basis of the Holy Roman Empire." This story has its irony. Constantine, the supreme moderator of theological and power disputes between the ancient patriarchies and the effervescent doctors of the Church, qualifies as Ton Ektos episkopos, ie 'bishop of the outside'; those who do not belong to the Catholic clergy.
And why will Francis be remembered except for the attempt to open the doors of the Church to the "out", the laity and the marginalized of the geographical and spiritual peripheries? The dispute between 'missionaries' and 'institutional' of Constantinian origin continues to be fought around the delimitation of 'inside' and 'outside', both in ecclesiastical organization and in their external projection, starting with the relationship with other Christian churches, especially the Orientals.
While an Esmulo de Alexandre Vi Borgia is expected that in 1494 by the encyclical package leaflet “Inter caetera” divided the colonial spheres of Portugal and Spain with a longitudinal trace of sacred pencil in the middle of the Atlantic, these two alleged sets are not being highlighted.
This is the papal title of the Patriarch of the West. The first pontiff baptized with this title was Leo I. At the initiative of the East Emperor Theodosius II, to distinguish the main apostolic headquarters under his direct jurisdiction such as Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem and Rome caput of Latin Catholicism. Title resumed by Pope Theodore I in 642, by his own initiative.
Anticipation of the future great schism of 1054 between the church of Rome and the orthodox churches, never remedied. Today comes the need to redefine the term 'West', a fundamental issue of Catholic geopolitics. The subject of a sophisticated exchange between Benedict XVI and Francisco, under the sign of the paradox. Ratzinger renounced in 2006 to his title of Patriarch of the West because he considered that he diminished the universal mandate. However, he masks this intention with his opposite.
He argues that renunciation can benefit ecumenical dialogue. Thesis that in no way convinces the orthodox, suspicious of the Roman claims in relation to them. And behold, the least western of modern popes, Francisco, restores this title. He, who, by his Latin American and specifically Peronian mentality, smells of sulfur north of the Bravo River (Great), does not fall in love with the old continent, proclaims himself a patriarch of the West, in the common sense of America and Europe.
And it does so for the declared reasons, but not much felt by Ratzinger which is to dialogue as the bishop of Rome with the Christian East. Perhaps Leo XIV will want to close the circle, he is American by birth and, therefore, western, reappropriating the patriarchal title. We find here an example of the semantic curse that sometimes corrupts geopolitical analysis. The flattening of 'global' communication discolves the meanings of words.
The same term assumes opposite or different meanings, depending on who pronounces it and its ends. Festival of «where are you going? I take fish ». Their fasts also infest the 'language' of the clergy, understood as Babel, especially when he crosses terms worn out by the multiple use of the media in secular areas. We play with empty or too full of meanings.
As, for example, West. That is, Europe, its antecedent and cause in current strategic jargon. Intellectual drama sung for almost a millennium by Bernardo de Cluny in the satirical heximeters of the "de Conteptu Mundi", which inspired Umberto Eco in "The Name of the Rose." Bernardo proclaims that "Stat Rosa Pristina Nomine, Nomina Nuda Tenemus" (I, 952) - "The Primitive Rose subsists only in the name, we only have simple names." Some manuscripts bring "Rome" instead of "rose".
The rose is not something. Rome is still. Or not? What if also Europe of Roman-Germanic affiliation, western matrix, be reduced only to the name? The ancient garden of Christianity is becoming a desert. This is shouted by the naked numbers that announce the collapse of religious practice, the decline not only quantitative of the vocations of how many seminarians aspire to priesthood as any other career, a poor but safe job, the almost exhaustion of missionaries, not to mention the quality of the clergy.
Hence the reduced influence of the Catholic world on lifestyle, politics and the high culture or widespread of the old continent. European Western Christendom is baptized on April 15, 800, when Leo III Crown Emperor Charlemagne, for the irritation of the Byzantines. Carolingian stigma is the icon of contemporary Europeanism. But what remains of Koiné Eurodemocrista of which, after World War II, originated the European Union in its first community robes, under the sponsorship of the new Western hegemonic, the United States of America?

This split between paradises, by the way, was felt by multiple authors leading to great theories, discussions, interpretations, and debates, in what would be known as the Miltonian criticism in the twentieth century, that the first version of the work, this one published in 1667. For all this there will be and always people who are bored.
The epic style should not dismantle those who want to enter the foliage of this paradise, the blank verse that is armed is a kind of free verse that has to do with the syntactic complexity of descriptions that require great flexibility in a consecutive network between classic and biblical. There are many acrostics, which makes the poem an initiation to what would later become visual poetry. Two columns are outlined here: Lucifer, Adam, and Eve, then the angelic wars and the archangels in a three -day battle in which the rebels banned, God creates the world. The story goes on a intricate parade about free will, which sliding in the fall, Lucifer ends up close and transformed in the face of the two creatures that God created for a different design from what happens.
Problems in paradise are not often factual, but almost always, symbolic, if among the network of blessings there is one that will betray the harmonic movement for which any paradise is created, the eye of God who sees everything, takes forum of justice and distance. William Blake said: "The reason that led Milton to write chained when he did it over angels and God, and in freedom when he wrote about demons and hell, is because he was a true poet and was part of the devil's party unknowingly."
English romanticism saw this in Milton.  Giovanni Papini would not have been more logo.
In the hot summer paradise this will not be unmeasured by a less routine stop, and it can still be thought that paradises are many but not as many as what is mentioned here. Milton was blinded and dictated his poem, which already tells us a lot about the activity of scribe, here, where there is always salvation for the defeated. We will read Book IV as we read Canto IX of the Lusíadas, which is where Adam and Eve appear to us, but a bad angel escapes from the abyss to turn lovers into future martyrs- and Gabriel the most moving angel of heaven- he always appears to save lovers, announce pregnancy, unite the Abraamic tribes. He appears. [Sleep packed night night, and in both naked rain roses from the ceiling in flower that the alvah replenishes. Sleep happily… 768]
The first Portuguese translation is in 1789, others would be followed in a small public space as paradise are after all.</description><pubDate>2025-08-13 00:46:49</pubDate></item><item><title>Social Networks | Macau hosts week dedicated to digital influencers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/redes-sociais-macau-acolhe-semana-dedicada-a-influencers-digitais/</link><description>The territory will host an event dedicated to digital influencers between October 24 and 28, entitled “CreatorWeekmacao 2025”.

The information was released at a press conference on Friday, where the PJ revealed to have received complaints from two elderly people who were convinced to invest in gold and exchange rate, losing $ 5.12 million from Hong Kong and $ 3.3 million from Hong Kong (HKD), respectively.
The PJ identified the suspect allegedly responsible for receiving money in Macao, more precisely in his workplace (a restaurant in Nape), where they worked without legal qualification. The individual who gave him the money was identified by the authorities, but continues to Mount.
After the suspect's detention, resident of Hong Kong, the PJ found 1.6 million HKD in the restaurant. Authorities suspect that the detainee will have started receiving and laundering money from burlas since June last year, in an approximately 60 million HKD, through the purchase of digital currencies. The case was referred to the prosecutor.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:39:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Mud | Drainage network will cover area between Rua de Cunha and Dome</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/taipa-rede-de-drenagem-ira-abranger-area-entre-rua-de-cunha-e-dome/</link><description>After the serious floods that especially affected Taipa and Coloane last Thursday, a member of the Advisory Board for Municipal Affairs made known a renewal in the drainage network, a “system created many years ago and that does not meet the current needs”.
The counselor to Weng Hei indicated that the institute for municipal affairs will build a rainwater lifting station in the East Asia Games Avenue area. For this infrastructure, the public tender has already been completed. Speaking to the TDM Macao channel, the official added that a drainage network will be created between the IEC Long factory and the Dome Water Pump Station of the East Asia Games.
The counselor also pointed out that the works can improve water drainage in cases of strong rain. However, he pointed out that floods last week, particularly in the old neighborhoods of Taipa, were aggravated by the condensation of fats and accumulation of tree leaves in the gutters. As such, he asked the authorities to be aware and reinforce the cleaning work more regularly, particularly in the new black points of flooding.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:38:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Iam | Licenses for Esplanads are returning</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/iam-licencas-para-esplanadas-estao-de-regresso/</link><description>The Institute for Municipal Affairs has accepted, since Friday and experimental, new requests for license for terraces. However, these can only work in the daytime, and should end at 21h and be able to open at 9am the next day. Restoration sector responsible applaud the measure
 
After a meeting with the Union of Associations of Macao Restoration and Beverages Owners, the Institute for Municipal Affairs (AMI) has even decided to re -issue licenses to Esplanades, a process that had been suspended since 2009.
The experimental license request can be made since last Friday, 15. However, there are many rules to comply with these restoration establishments or bars, starting with the fact that the terraces cannot work at night. It includes “the prohibition of the functioning of the terraces between 9 pm and 9am the next day”, given “the situation of the Esplanades of Anim'Arte Nam Van or Patio of Commander Mata e Oliveira”.
In addition, “loud or other similar equipment that emit sound in the area of the terraces cannot be placed, taking into account the Environmental Noise Prevention and Control Law, describes the AMI in a note.
It is up to the establishments of the establishments to “maintain the cleaning and hygiene of the terrace and the surrounding space, periodically cleaning the respective area during the operating period and immediately arranging the place after daily use”. "Stains should be removed from the floor and immediately remove all objects from the site after the daily closure" of the terraces. There are even rules for the size of the tables and chairs to put on the street, with a cost of 1,200 patacas for each square meter of space they occupy.
Sector Congratulations
16 years ago AMI has not attributed new licenses of terraces, and now it intends to do so "in order to optimize the business environment of Macao's small and medium-sized companies" and after "auscultation the opinions of the sector." However, to advance in this decision, “several factors such as the balance between the community environment and the life of the population” were taken into account.
Given that this is an experimental period of license issuance, AMI promises to "constantly monitor effectiveness, creating favorable conditions to revitalize the community economy."
However, Deputies Ngan Iek Hang, Cheung Kin Chung, and some counselors have shown in favor of this measure, saying that the most terraced creation can enrich the characteristics of Macao tourism.
Speaking to the newspaper or Mun, Cheung Kin Chung praised that the measure not only enriches the Macao cultural tourism industry, but also encourages the economic revitalization of community neighborhoods, constituting more support and a source of hope for the tourism sector.
Already Ngan Iek Hang said that clearer guidelines should be made, and there must be a narrower communication with the sector. The deputy, linked to the General Union of Macao residents' associations, also warned that the supervision mechanism should be reinforced in order to ensure that there is no violation of the new rules of the terraces, regarding the noise and cleaning of spaces.
For its part, the member of the Advisory Board for Municipal Affairs, Law Chong In, praised that the Esplanade format is very popular within China and foreign countries, not only spaces for restoration, but also cultural tourism.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:37:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Coloane | New Parking Park will have 70 seats</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/coloane-novo-parque-de-estacionamento-tera-70-lugares/</link><description>The Directorate of Public Works (DSOP) will create a provisional parking park, with about 70 seats for cars and motorcycles, on a land where the Coloane Flying Eagle Training Center operated, which is situated by the Cheoc Van Road and Cordoaria Street.

Extending the analysis at the first half of 2025, the official data show an annual increase of 1.8 percent of GDP
 
Between April and June this year, Macao Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 5.1 percent compared to the same period last year. The GDP reached, in the second quarter, 100.39 billion patacas, "equivalent to 88.8 percent of the economic volume of the year 2019," said the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC) in a statement.
In the second quarter of 2025, the economy “grew again, due to the number of visitors increased by remarkably, which were attracted to a number of measures, and [the] private consumer expense if kept stable,” reads the same note.
Global service exports specifies DSEC in the statement increased by 6 percent, in annual terms, "since the number of visitors in the Masters rose about 20 percent in the second quarter of this year." Exports of other tourist services rose 5.9 percent and game services grew 9.9 percent.
With regard to foreign trade in goods, in the second quarter, exports and imports of goods fell 6.6 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively, compared to the same period of 2024.
Extended perspective
In terms of internal demand, in the quarter under analysis, the government's final consumer consumption and private consumer expense increased 1 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively, in annual terms.
"Gross fixed capital formation decreased by 3.7 percent, due to the decrease in the number of private construction works, despite the 11.7 percent increase in investment in private sector equipment, of 19.9 percent in the investment in the construction of the public sector and 83 percent in investing in the public sector," he says.
In a semiannual analysis, GDP rose 1.8 percent in the first six months of the year, when compared to the same period last year.
Exports of services, government final consumer expense, private consumer consumer expense and fixed capital formation rose 1, 1.1, 0.3 and 1.8 percent, respectively, compared to the first half of 2024. During this period, the implicit deflator of GDP, which measures the global price variation, registered an annual drop of 0.5 percent, also referred to the DSEC.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:33:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

Donald Trump, who had previously stated that he was going to seek Lai's release before returning to power, indicated that he has already raised the issue with Beijing and insisted that he will do “everything he can to save” the former owner of the anti-china newspaper Apple Daily, to be tried in Hong Kong on accusations of collusion and sedition, for which he may be sentenced to perpetual arrest.
However, Trump acknowledged that "President XI [Jinping] will not be enthusiastic" to free Lai. "That said, the name [of Lai] has entered the circle of questions we are talking about and we will see what we can do," added Trump, warning that Lai "is not a young man" and that his health "is not very good."
The US President signed an executive order this week to suspend another 90 days the punitive overcutions in imports of China, while a comprehensive agreement continues to be negotiated. The suspension of tariff application is the expected result of the last round of negotiations between Americans and Chinese, held in Stockholm, Sweden at the end of last month.
The possible release of Jimmy Lai, charged with several crimes under the National Security Law of the Chinese Semi-Autonic Region of Hong Kong, would be a demonstration of Xi's goodwill to advance to a commercial agreement with the US, according to western analysts with US agencies.
Lai and the three companies linked to the extinct Apple Daily newspaper, which were one of the main mentors of the anti-china actions elapsed in the former British colonial, including Hong Kong's request for occupation by foreign troops, facing accusations under the National Security Act, which provides for penalties that can go to life imprisonment for acts such as betrayal, insurrection, sabotage, external interference, section, section, section. Theft of state secrets and espionage, something common in this type of legislation.
Imposed by Beijing after months of protests and chaos on the city streets, the law led to the closure of offices of organizations such as Radio Asia Livre, as well as media such as Apple Daily and Stand News, which openly defended Hong Kong's independence and were considered anti-china organizations, with English and American and US funding.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:58:10</pubDate></item><item><title>China | Restricted accumulation of rare land by foreign companies</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/china-restringida-acumulacao-de-terras-raras-por-empresas-estrangeiras/</link><description>Beijing asked foreign companies to avoid accumulating rare land reserves, at a time when the fear of export restrictions is increasing the demand for these metals, crucial to various strategic technologies, the Financial Times said.
According to sources cited by the newspaper, Beijing warned that excessive storage of rare lands and derived products, such as ways used on electric motors, could expose companies to higher risk of scarcity. Authorities would also be deliberately limited export volumes approved to wage the creation of large inventories abroad.
China processes about 90% of the worldwide supply of rare land and manufactures 94% of permanent iam, using this control as a pressure instrument during the commercial war with the United States. In April, he placed seven medium and heavy rare land categories on the export control list, which also encompassed permanent iam and other finished products, causing shortage in sectors such as the car.
Efforts to prevent companies from accumulating major inventories, which would give them more flexibility to respond to scarcity and price fluctuations, show Beijing's determination to maintain maximum influence on the sector, sources said.
In April, China placed seven medium-sized rare land categories on an export control list in response to the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. The measure, which also encompassed permanent iam and other finished products, caused scarcity in various sectors, particularly in the automotive industry.
Although Washington and Beijing have woken up this week a new 90 -day length of trade war, Chinese control over rare land supplies remains an important part of negotiations.
Beijing controls the production of rare land through extraction and processing quotas. Last year, only two state -owned companies received quotas.
China exported 3,188 tons of permanent rare land in June, more than twice the May volume, but less than 38% than the same month as last year. From three months to June - since Beijing imposed commercial restrictions - the exports of the imm were about half of the volume recorded in the same period of the previous year.
A study by the US Business Council, conducted in July, indicated that half of the companies inquired saw their pending or rejected export requests, especially when the volume exceeded the historical average.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:52:15</pubDate></item><item><title>China | Industrial production grew 5.7% in July</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/china-producao-industrial-cresceu-57-em-julho/</link><description>Industrial production in China grew 5.7% in July, in homologous terms, slowing down the previous month and being below analyst forecasts, according to data released today by the National Statistics Office of the Asian country. Analysts expected a descent to 5.9% after the homologous growth of 6.8% recorded in June. Among the three main sectors considered in the indicator, the manufacturing sector recorded the highest climb (6.2%), followed by mining (5%) extraction and the production and supply of electricity, heating, gas and water (3.3%). In the accumulated 2025, industrial production increased by 6.3%. Retail sales, the main indicator of consumption, grew 3.7% in July, slowing down the 4.8% in June.
The body pointed out that the economy “surpassed a complex and changing external environment,” but pointed to the negative impact of “extreme meteorological phenomena” that affected various regions of the country, including heavy rainfall, flooding and dried.
The official urban unemployment rate was 5.2% in July, compared to 5% in the previous month. Investment in fixed assets increased by 1.6% in the first seven months of the year, below 2.8% recorded until June and lower than predictions of 2.7%.
By sectors, investment in the manufacturing sector grew by 6.2%and in infrastructure 3.2%, while destined for real estate promotion fell 12%, reflecting the prolonged sector crisis. Commercial real estate sales, measures by land, retreated 9.2% in the accumulated until July.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:50:54</pubDate></item><item><title>China | House prices fall for the 26th consecutive month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/china-precos-das-casas-caem-pelo-26o-mes-consecutivo/</link><description>New housing prices in China fell for the twenty -sixth consecutive month in July, despite government measures to wage the prolonged crisis that affects the sector, according to official data released yesterday.
In the 70 cities analyzed, prices fell by 0.31% compared to June, according to calculations made based on data released by China's National Statistics Office, which pointed to a 0.27% drop in the previous month.
Sixty cities registered descents in New Housing prices, against 56 in June, while six - including Shanghai - registered increases, less than the 14 in the previous month. In four cities, prices remained unchanged.
The calculations also show that the price of secondhand dwellings fell 0.51% in July compared to June, a slowdown regarding the downward of 0.61% of the previous month. In this segment, virtually all cities analyzed registered breaks, except Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province (West), where prices did not vary, and Taiyuan (Center), which recorded a slight climb.
In recent years, Chinese authorities have announced several measures to contain the collapse of the real estate market, whose stabilization is seen as crucial for social stability, as housing is one of the main investment vehicles of Chinese families.
The real estate sector crisis, which represents about 30% of China's gross domestic product, including indirect effects, is pointed out as one of the main factors of the recent deceleration of the country's economy.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:49:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Xi Jinping Felicita Indonesia</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/xi-jinping-felicita-indonesia/</link><description>Chinese president Xi Jinping congratulated the Indonesian leader yesterday for the 80th anniversary of Indonesia independence and highlighted the bilateral relations, which this year celebrates 75 years, state news agency Xinhua said. Xi stressed that in these eight decades Indonesia has achieved “remarkable development” and plays “an increasingly important role” in the regional and international scene.
In 2025, he recalled the Chinese leader, the two countries celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties, with relations reached "great progress", while the traditional friendship "was reinforced over time."
The two leaders had two meetings last year, in which they reached consensus on the construction of a “China-Indonsia community with a shared future and regional and global influence”, raising bilateral relations to “a new level,” noted the Chinese president.
The ruler said he was willing to work with the Indonesian homologist for "new achievements" that support the modernization of both countries and contribute to peace, stability and regional and world development.
Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi sent a message of congratulations to the Indonesian counterpart, Sigrano, stressing the “strong dynamics” of bilateral ties.
China and Indonesia celebrate this anniversary after signed several memorandum of understanding in 2024 in areas such as Tourism, Agriculture, Health, Investment and Supply Chains. Countries cooperate in high -level projects such as the development of electric vehicles and the new capital of Indonesia, Nusantara.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:48:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump says China will not advance against Taiwan during his term</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/trump-diz-que-china-nao-avancara-contra-taiwan-durante-o-seu-mandato/</link><description>United States President Donald Trump said yesterday that his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, assured him that he will not order any offensive against Taiwan, at least during his term in the White House. In an interview with Fox News, Trump ruled out that Beijing plans to “move forward” on an island he considers to be under his sovereignty and to which Washington has offered military aid in recent years.
"I don't think this will happen while you are here," said Trump, who said he had express guarantees from the Asian giant president. "President XI said it," he added, without giving details about the negotiations.
Trump and Xi have been talking by telephone since the republican tycoon of the White House in January, but the last direct meeting between the two dates back to 2019. The two countries now have several open political fronts, including the tariff war promoted by Trump and still pending in the case of China.
Last week, Washington and Beijing extended for another three months the deadline to reach some kind of agreement that avoids the imposition of indiscriminate tariffs on bilateral trade flow.
In recent years, the US has intensified their attention on Taiwan, most often visiting the island, selling weapons and other military equipment and encouraging Taipé a more muscular attitude towards Beijing.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:47:18</pubDate></item><item><title>China defends internal peace, reconciliation and social harmony in Myanmar</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/china-defende-paz-interna-reconciliacao-e-harmonia-social-em-myanmar/</link><description>Chinese foreign minister said he hoped the next elections in Myanmar (formerly Burma) will bring “internal peace”, “national reconciliation” and “social harmony” to the country during a meeting with the neighboring country's counterpart.
The meeting took place in the Chinese city of Anning, under the Lancang-10 Sub-Regional Forum, which brought together representatives from China, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.
According to a statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Wang Yi stated that Beijing "supports Myanmar in the search for a development path adapted to his national conditions and with the support of the people, as well as in the protection of sovereignty, independence and national unity."
Chinese diplomacy chief assured that Beijing “will continue to provide support and assistance to Myanmar within his possibilities” and appealed to the elaboration of a reconstruction plan after the earthquake that shook the country in March, causing more than 3,000 dead.
Wang also expressed the desire for Burmese authorities to "continue to combat transfronist crime and maintain peace and stability on the border between the two countries."
In recent years, powerful criminal groups, many with connections to China, have turned parts of Myanmar into a "online" circumvents center involving victims in various countries, especially in China, which brought tension to bilateral relations. "Beijing expects Myanmar to guarantee the safety of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in the country," the minister added.
According to the statement, Burmese diplomacy chief Than Shwe, "thanked China for the valuable support and assistance for the economic and social development of Myanmar and for reconstruction after the earthquake." "The state of emergency ended and Myanmar actively prepares the overall elections scheduled for the end of this year. The country will strive for securing safe, stable, fluid and credible elections and is willing to invite a Chinese delegation to observe them," said the ruler.
The opposition considers the suffrage, scheduled for December, a “scam”. With more than 2,100 kilometers of common border, China maintains a pragmatic approach to the volatile neighboring country, preserving ties with generals, but also with rebel groups and pro-democracy opposition, to ensure their numerous economic projects in the region.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:46:13</pubDate></item><item><title>China launches program to attract foreign “brains”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/17/china-lanca-programa-para-atrair-cerebros-estrangeiros/</link><description>A Fundação Nacional de Ciências Naturais da China (NSFC), administrada pelo governo, acaba de abrir um novo lote de oportunidades de financiamento para atrair cientistas de fora da China com doutoramento e menos de 40 anos.
The announcement says that candidates must have been born after January 1, 1985, have a doctorate and conduct mainly research in Natural Sciences, Technology and Engineering. Devem ter 36 meses consecutivos de experiência profissional formal fora da China em universidades, instituições de investigação e departamentos de investigação de empresas de renome após o doutoramento e antes de 15 de setembro de 2025, com requisitos de experiência profissional reduzidos para candidatos excepcionais.
They must, moreover, 'have achieved scientific or technological results recognized by pairs in the area and demonstrate potential to become academic leaders or prominent talents in the discipline', according to the announcement.
NSFC financing for selected candidates totals between one million yuans ($ 140,000) and three million yuans ($ 418,000) over three years.
NSFC has launched its program aimed at hosted scientists outside China in 2021. Since then, it usually opens funding opportunities in the early months of the year, except April 2023, when it opened for an extra week to “mitigate the impact caused by the Covid-19 pandemic”.
Following a routine announcement in February 2025, NSFC made it clear on July 30 that last week's opening is a 'new round' to attract 'more' scientists from outside China. However, the exact amount of the new financing was not disclosed.
Candidates are enrolled through a host Chinese institution, usually a university or research institution registered in the NSFC system. After two levels of analysis, financing is distributed to scientists through the host institution, increasing the research budget of the latter.
Many Chinese universities have adhered to the ad, inviting almost simultaneously foreign scientists to apply for new funding through them. An incomplete list of Chinese universities that have made public invitations includes the University of Beijing, the Renmin University of China, the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Jilin, etc.
China has long suffered from what is often called “brain escape” from scientific and technical talents, as a very high proportion of China -born scientists who graduate from American universities choose to stay in the US.
A survey conducted in 2023 by the US National Science Foundation found that 83% of doctors in Science and Technology born in China who obtained their diplomas in the United States between 2017 and 2019 remained in the United States approximately 5 years after graduation. The number is “significantly higher than the average of all countries of origin,” says the NSF report.
The Chinese government has launched several campaigns to attract talent in science and technology, including those without Chinese descent to go to China.
NSFC -funded scientists should renounce their jobs abroad and work full time in China, responding to the concerns of suspicious observers who claim to have two simultaneous jobs on opposite Pacific sides often means that China is stealing from the United States.
The new financing round also comes at a time of drastic cuts in the US scientific research financing, which many say will help China attract global talents.</description><pubDate>2025-08-17 22:45:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Electronics | Foxconn's profits rise 27%</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/15/electronica-lucros-da-foxconn-sobem-27/</link><description>Foxconn profits, the world's largest automaker of electronic products, reached 44,361 million Taiwanese dollars (€ 1,265 million) in the second quarter of 2025, a 27%homologous increase, the company announced. The result, above analyst forecasts, was driven by the global demand for cloud servers and products, which accounted for 41% of sales between April and June, exceeding the first time electronic consumer products (35%).
The quarter's revenue totaled 1.79 billion of Taiwanese dollars (51,166 million euros), 16% more than in the same period last year, according to technology based in the city of Novo Taipei, northern Taiwan. For the rest of the year, the group has cut income forecasts in the area of electronic devices and components, but maintained high expectations for the server business and improved projections for computer products.
In the first half, net income rose 51.56% in homologous terms to $ 86,469 million Taiwanese (2,466 million euros), with revenues of 3.43 billion Taiwanese dollars (98,089 million euros), plus 19.59%.
Foxconn bets on the manufacture of artificial intelligence servers, providing for sales to exceed a billion of Taiwanese dollars (28,534 million euros), equivalent to 50% of its total server business.
The company expects the revenue of this segment to increase more than 170% in homologous terms in the third quarter, compared to a 60% growth between April and June.
Earlier this month, Foxconn announced the sale of an old Ohio (United States) vehicle factory for about $ 375 million (321 million euros), as part of the bet on artificial intelligence and advanced data centers.
In July, he signed a “strategic alliance” with Teco Electric, one of the five largest manufacturers of industrial engines, to build AI data centers and diversify the business beyond consumer electronics production, such as iPhone.
Founded in 1974, Foxconn has factories and research centers in China, India, Japan, Vietnam and the United States, among other countries, and is one of the leading manufacturers of the US GB200 servers.

Today, Beijing seeks “alternative mechanisms” of cooperation in the “global south” and tries to build an alternative model to the World Health Organization
 
 
Let's start with the concept of Global Health Governance (GGS). Is this a more contemporary concept or relating to the post-war period and the Foundation of the World Health Organization (WHO)? What have been the main actors of this governance until China's growth?
GGS is a concept whose prominence and relevance have grown significantly in the 21st century, largely driven by economic globalization and worldwide interconnection. Although global health has always transcended national borders, demanding multidisciplinary approaches and international cooperation, only from the 1990s it was made greater awareness of it. Historically, GGS has been predominantly influenced by western powers and neoliberal values. The main actors of this governance, until China's growth, were historically marked by interventions of entities such as WHO and non-governmental, predominantly American and European organizations.
One of the findings of its doctoral thesis is that China has been progressively positioning itself in this leadership. This position started specifically when and why?
Yes, China has been progressively positioned as a relief actor in the evolution of the GG system. Although it is not possible to point out an exact date of start, China has evolved from a relatively isolated country to a main actor in global political, economic and technological arenas. Its growing economic and political influence also represents a change in GGS's historical dynamics, and in the 1960s China tried to play a humanitarian health care role in neighboring countries and Africa. The thesis points out that China's experience can be seen as an example of what is achievable when a state chooses its own way rather than a pre-established model, aligning itself with the 21st century prediction as the "century of Asia."
Did the pandemic years influence this position? How?
Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the need for global health cooperation, as well as the potential consequences of the failure to prioritize global health. The thesis explores the evolution of the Health Silk Route before and after the pandemic, indicating that the pandemic years allowed greater awareness of the need for instruments such as the Health Silk Route as the most effective cooperation platforms among nations. Although not detailed in this specific section, it is implicit that the pandemic intensified China's performance in health diplomacy and health development assistance.
Looking at the internal reforms that China has carried out in the health area, which highlights as the most important?
I approach, in the thesis, the reforms of the China Health System and I point out that the Chinese governance model is a unique combination of state -oriented economic reforms and development by the state, incorporating elements of neoliberalism and authoritarianism into political issues in general, and the health sector is nothing different from the rest. One of China's mentioned contributions, recognized by WHO, is its primary health care model based on the recognized good practice of “barefoot doctors” (barefoot doctors). In addition, the thesis analyzes the main reform policies and their progress and challenges in the period 2009-2018, which comprise the reforms of primary health care, hospital and pharmaceutical reform. The “Healthy China 2030” program is also an important and ambitious reference of China's domestic reforms in health, also encompassing social determinants.
Is Beijing's intention to create an alternative entity to WHO, or simply create an alternative movement that can coexist with WHO, in the context of the relationship with the global south? How could this work?
The thesis suggests that China adopts a "dual approach": while integrating in existing global structures, forging simultaneously alternative paths, particularly through regional alliances such as BRICS and partnerships with Global South. This indicates an intention to create an alternative movement that can coexist and complement the role of WHO, rather than a direct alternative entity. China demonstrates a clear commitment to align the objectives of the “Belt and Road” initiative with the united nations sustainable development objectives, showing their willingness to present these initiatives as complements to the existing cooperation mechanisms in the international liberal order. President Xi Jinping's view of a “future community shared for humanity”, which includes the notion of a “global health community for all”, also points to a new perspective in international cooperation.
Traditional Chinese Masks, Vaccines and Medicine (MTC): What are China's products or instruments to position itself as an increasingly global actor in GGS?
The thesis points out that China is an indispensable provider of global public health, essential for the product supply chain, such as masks and vaccines. The MTC is also mentioned as one of China's great contributions to global health governance, with its chinese herbal treatments, some of which already recognized by WHO in 2017. In addition, Chinese medical assistance and medical teams sent to other regions of the globe are important instruments of Chinese health diplomacy.
In creating an alternative movement or reality to WHO, China may be taking advantage of the lack of full representativeness in the same WHO, or gaps in its operation?
The thesis does not address directly whether China is taking advantage of a lack of full representativeness in WHO or gaps in its operation. However, it emphasizes that the work aims to fill a gap in scientific knowledge in relation to the paradigm of health governance from a non-western and liberal perspective, emphasizing China as an actor of the global south. This suggests that China seeks to strengthen alternative models that can offer more personalized health challenges, different from those defended by Western countries, positioning itself as a moderate reformist actor.
How has the European Union (EU) foreign policy in relation to China affecting or influenced this position of the country in global health governance?
In the thesis, the fourth publication, entitled "Challenges on the European Union-China Cooperation in Higher Education from" People-To-People Dialogue ’Perspective: The Case of Health-Related Joint Projects," explores cooperation in higher education, in particular that includes health-related projects. Therefore, despite the strategic and economic dialogue, the deterioration of UE-china bilateral relations intensified, with the commission to assume a decline of enthusiasm due to “China's countermeasures to EU human rights sanctions, economic coercion and commercial measures against the single market, and the positioning of China in the war in Ukraine”. Although challenges and tensions are recognized, cooperation in higher education, including health projects, is seen as part of a broader picture of strategic partnership between EU and China. However, it is evident that there is no long tradition of health cooperation between EU and China in higher education, and that there are few joint projects compared to the general panorama. It is suggested that both EU and China should make more efforts to align medical study curricula and promote more joint research in areas related to health, infectious diseases, among others.
In the Trump 2.0 era, and without pandemic, what could be China's role in global health governance?
Although the thesis is published this year, it focuses on the preceding period and includes the pandemic, where it does not speculate directly on a future scenario of “Trump 2.0” without pandemic. However, the thesis argues that China is not just a participant, but a moderate reformist force in the formation of global health standards. Regardless of future political scenarios, their growing economic and political influence, strategic health diplomacy, internal reforms and initiatives such as the Health Silk Route will continue to shape their role in global health governance. The view of a “global health community for all” also remains a guiding principle for China's efforts.
Does this power of China in GGS verify more with bilateral or multilateral agreements?
The thesis suggests that China's power in global health governance manifests itself through both bilateral and multilateral agreements, but with a growing emphasis on certain forms of cooperation that strengthen their role in the global south and through alternative mechanisms. Although the thesis does not explicitly quantify the predominance between bilateral and multilateral, the focus on regional alliances (BRICS) and partnerships with the Global South (which often involve bilateral agreements and group cooperation initiatives) and the Health Silk Route indicate a hybrid approach.</description><pubDate>2025-06-30 23:46:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Macao Forum | Secretary-General says it has never discussed widening to Hispanic countries</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/30/forum-macau-secretario-geral-diz-que-nunca-se-discutiu-alargamento/</link><description>In an interview with Lusa agency, the secretary general of the Macau Forum, Ji Xianzheng, assured that “never discussed” the widening of action to Hispanic countries, but that the willingness already stated by the government of Sam Hou Fai will have to be the authorities to decide a new direction to the cooperation strategy.
 
The Secretary-General of the Macau Forum stated that the institution “never discussed” the creation of an entity to extend to Hispanic countries to promote economic cooperation similar to those that provide the connection between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.
“Within the Macao Forum, we have never discussed this topic,” said the Forum Secretary-General for Economic and Commercial Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries Ji Xianzheng.
The official acknowledged that, "in society, there were some conversations to discuss or address the possibility of promoting more contact and cooperation with Spanish -language countries, but at the Forum level we have never addressed this theme."
The Macao executive announced in mid -April the intention of creating a center to promote economic services between China and the Portuguese and Spanish languages in the neighboring special Economic Zone of Hengqin.
The idea is to provide companies in Hispanic countries services in the “linguistic, legal, fiscal, verification of compliance with norms, formation, arbitration and mediation”, according to the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong.
Days earlier, the chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, had also announced the intention of “promoting exchange and cooperation” through Macao between China and the universe of Spanish -speaking countries.
Although Macau wants to widen focus to Castilian -speaking countries, “the forum will remain the forum for China and Lusophony countries,” said Ji Xianzheng. The secretary general clarified that the institution that directs "can contribute contributions to the greater opening of Macao in international cooperation", as is the intention announced by the new government of MSAR.
Complementary forum
Personally, the secretary-general guaranteed to have "all the pleasure of working with all parties," but stressed that this is a "decision that is up to the central governments to make" and that the forum was never contacted in this regard.
"Yes, I worked in Latin America, Spain, nine years in Madrid and Caracas. But this is not a decision of personal interest, it is up to politicians to make the decision," he said, explaining that the idea will be to promote the relationship between Macao and Brazil and then to other Latin American countries, as well as expanding the relationship with Portugal to Spain.
"There is no limit. The Macao Forum is complementary. It does not restrict any promotion of the cooperation of the other parts," he said.
According to the Macao Government Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai admitted on June 21 that he postponed a trip to Portugal, scheduled for July, and should also pass through Spain and the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
Bad interpretations
In the same interview with Lusa, the Secretary-General of the Macao Forum imputed to national governments the responsibility for conducting development and economic cooperation policies, stressing that the institution “has no investment projects”.
Ji Xianzheng attributes criticism to the Macao Forum to an wrong interpretation regarding the body's mission. "The forum is a mechanism of cooperation between central governments. Many people think it is to the secretariat that it is up to the execution of policies, but we have a limited number of people," added Ji.
"The secretariat has no investment projects, it is a mechanism for preparing the ministerial conference, connecting with governments, not a promotion agency. It has not been thought of, connects with the promotion agencies. We are four people sent by China and one delegate for each country," he said.
At the last ministerial conference, in April 2024, then Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Reis argued that the Portuguese Language China-Parais Cooperation and Development Fund should bet more on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The Cooperation Fund was created in 2013 by the China Development Bank and the Macao Industrial and Commercial Development Fund, with a thousand million dollars, of which about 60 percent have already been invested, according to the secretary general.
Action plans
Ji Xianzheng has admitted that SMEs are "a difficult theme for any government" and that "international cooperation for the promotion of development and cooperation of small and medium enterprises is even more difficult. It is a topic that is being debated daily worldwide." But admitted, "here, little."
"But it is stipulated in the action plan [2024-2026]. It is up to central governments and commerce chambers, promotion agents, to work together to do this. The secretariat assumes responsibility as authorized by the central governments, specifically, in the activities program," he said.
Politicians from various countries, including Portugal, Angola and Mozambique, have appealed to a change in the rules of the fund's candidacy. Current rules require, for example, that candidate projects have a minimum investment of five million dollars, and the fund only covers 20 percent of total investment, referring the rest to governments or companies.
Ji Xianzheng said the new fund's new direction "is committed to promoting a broader investment, with better coverage for all forum countries, [relatively] to projects that have a strategic or significant impact on the socioeconomic development of participating countries."
According to the secretary general, "the terms of application [of the rules of access to the background] will be more flexible and the forms of application will also be more diverse." “Instead of being just direct investment, they are also studying ways to apply the fund, in cooperation with other funds or with other financial institutions,” he gave as an example.
"This fund has an operation according to market rules. It is not a humanitarian aid fund. Therefore, it has to guarantee the minimum return of benefit. But, on that, they are very open to study, if by case the conditions of each project," added Ji Xianzheng, but to give examples of "flexibility of rules."
Regarding the approximation of the China universe and countries of the Iberian Peninsula, already cemented in official speeches, economist Maria Fernanda Ilhéu, president of the Seda's New Route Association, told HM, earlier this month, that this intention is “very objective and pragmatic and can be summarized to the Macao economy diversification project, for which companies and investors are not only in Macao, but also from Macao, but also from Macao, but also from countries, but countries Portuguese Language ”.
"But the fact is that companies and institutions from Portuguese-speaking countries are not being effective in responding to this need for Macao. Therefore, widening companies and Spanish-speaking institutions this invitation to cooperation seems logical to me," the economist said.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Isabel Rio Novo, author of the biography of Luís de Camões: “Time in Macau was of tranquility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/06/26/isabel-rio-novo-autora-da-biografia-de-luis-de-camoes-tempo-em-macau-foi-de-tranquilidade/</link><description>It will be launched tomorrow, at the Consulate General of Portugal in Macau and Hong Kong, the biography of Luís de Camões, by Isabel Rio Novo. In an interview with HM, the author unravels some secrets about the poet's life in Macau, a period of relative calm in the middle of a almost always turbulent life
 
Why did you decide to get in the writing of another biography of Camões?
It is true that Luis Vaz de Camões has been biographed many times over 500 years. However, 50 years ago there was no biography about him. From my point of view and the editor, Camões deserved a more current biography that revised all kinds of prejudices, seeking known sources, the uncovered information research and where the rereading of all previous works were rereading. This biography is not only a summary, but also the reinterpretation of what has been known, but which had rarely been related. The book also brings some new data with some documentation that was discovered.
How was your relationship with the writing of Camões born?
I fell in love and went to those young readers who was not tormented with Camões. On the contrary, I liked it soon and let myself be seduced by Camões Lyric. I am from the areas of comparative literature and history, and in this sense I always understood the dimension and importance of the work of Camões.
And what are they?
It is a work and an author of its time and its time, which was extraordinary, with the Renaissance, Humanism and the travels of navigation. But at the same time, it is a work that is the product of an outstanding literary genius, one that we can tell a handful in the history of universal literature.
What camões we find in this biography?
I tried to go to the bottom, remove layers of the meaning that these 500 years were adding to Camões, in the sense that each season read its Camões and produced its interpretation. I wanted to discover the substrate, the man of flesh and bone he lived and wrote 500 years ago.
He was a man suffered, with many financial difficulties.
He was a man with a complex and difficult relationship with reality, not only of his time, but also with reality [itself]. The theme of the time, the disconcerting of the world, how society seems to work instead of what should work, being a literary topic of the Renaissance, it was something Camões felt personal and genuinely.
How?
He lived a series of disagreements, of extreme experiences. Suffice it to say that you have been stuck several times and for various reasons. He made great trips at a time when these were absolutely risky, long, and complicated enterprises. Camões was involved in military expeditions, and almost all his life was soldered. But this set of experiences allowed him to be almost everything someone could be at the time he lived.
He was one of the most traveled authors of the time, having been in Brazil, Goa…
Yes. Even the connection to Macau, which is contested by some scholars, but not by me… I am persuaded, given the existing documentation and indirect testimonies, which Camões passed through China with the position of Dead and Missing Provider. When this happened, albeit very incipiently, the Portuguese establishment in China, which was already Macao. It is not known whether Camões held this position assigned to him by Viceroy D. Francisco Coutinho, if he was exactly assigned to be a provider during the trip, or a provider at Macao's establishment. But what he knew from China was surely this little warehouse that Portugal had achieved, at a lot of cost, with great difficulty and after many attempts to obtain in China.
What did a deceased provider?
Whenever a Portuguese died in the East, a soldier or merchant, it was necessary to ensure the rights of the heirs, the families who were normally in Portugal. The provider had to identify the deceased, his naturalness, origin and make the heirs known. He also had to keep the deceased's assets before they were stolen, auction them, keep the coins that would result in, and then take it all to Lisbon. It was a process that, if it went well, took many months, because it was necessary to send this money to the authorities of Goa who later sent him in the career from India to Lisbon.
Can we talk about a period of stability in Camões's life in Macau?
Yes. Until this appointment as a deceased provider, everything Camões knew from the East had been as a soldier. As soon as Goa [1553] arrives weeks later in a first military expedition. We know why: Not because I had some war appeal, but because only participating in expeditions earned your welding. Although everyone said that the soldiers lived very poorly, the welding was what Camões had to survive. The time lived in Macao, when he was free from soldier obligations, was a time of tranquility regarding subsistence, which was assured. He had some time and calm to continue the work with "the Lusíadas." More than that, as much as the sources allow to deduce, Camões met in Macau a phase of balance in terms of personal and loving life, as, on the return trip, he brought with him, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto, a Chinese girl.
Dinamene.
This was the term used by the chronicler. We don't know if it would be a Chinese or Asian girl. This girl with whom Camões lived maritally was someone who liked it very much, according to the testimony of Diogo do Couto. But Dinamene would certainly not be her name, as it was a mythological name that, by the way, Camões used in her lyric, even before she boarded the East. Chinese girls with whom soldiers and merchants in Macao lived amanced were baptized and received a Christian name. Therefore, Dinamene would even have a Christian and Portuguese name. But as we do not know her name, and if we are aware that we use a kind of metaphor, we can call it Dinamene.
She dies later on a trip and makes Camões very shaken.
On Macao's return trip to Goa, probably at the end of his mandate as a provider, Camões suffers the celebrated wreck, in which he loses the personal assets he had ease, including the assets of the deceased that he was guardian, and this will bring him complications. It also suffers the loss of dynamine. The wreck went with some in the seas of China, probably by the mouth of the Mekong River.
Considers unlikely to have lost part of "the Lusíadas."
The first biographers say Camões was saved from this wreck with a board. It is not unreasonable that he managed to save the manuscript of the Lusíadas on this board. But it is also no excluding that Camões knew his poem by heart. The memory of people in the sixteenth century was different. They were very used to keeping things from memory. And we know, because the proof is obtained in the work of Camões, that it had an extraordinary memory. I have a way to prove it, of course, that Camões is one of the rare authors who knew his poem by heart.
Do you think Camões had a lower life to his true talent?
Undoubtedly. According to a too extensive set of concordant testimonies, he dies poor, even in miserable conditions, and according to an eyewitness, without having a blanket with which he covered himself. On the other hand, Camões was known to follow the publication of the Lusíadas, who were commented and read [in the poet's life time]. We have the testimony of Faria de Sousa, one of the first biographers of Camões, which says that when he passed the streets, people stop and pointed. Camões also had a figure that stood out, with a leaked eye and using a pale. By then, I would be quite sick, using crutches. But there is a set of poets, which is very unreliable that they did not know Camões, who never refer to them. There are, on the other hand, other humanists, such as Pedro Magalhães Gândavo, who from the outset praises him as the prince of Portuguese poets.
But the king gives him a tendency for deeds provided and the publication of "The Lusíadas."
This famous tendency, which should not be a big deal, because all ancient biographers say it was derisive, is attributed to him as a kind of military reform, because of the 17 years of service in the East, and not as a reward for the publication of "The Lusíadas." D. Sebastião's mercy letter, which attributes him the title of nobleman knight, had no repercussion in practice, but gave him 15 thousand reais. [The publication of “the Lusíadas”] was an additional argument [for the letter] and not the main argument. This leads us to believe that D. Sebastião will not even have read or heard “the Lusíadas”, will have received indirect information, favorable about the poem.
How did the process of editing “Os Lusíadas” occurred?
It was an event, because both the press and the books that were published a year were a very small amount. In the year in which “the Lusíadas” are published were the only work of non -religious caress [to be edited]. To fund the edition, it is more than likely that Camões had the support of a patron, probably D. Manuel de Portugal, from the Condes do Vimioso family. Getting the work was a press was a mere and complicated process, as it had to go through the prior examination of the civil authorities, the royal authority and the censorship of the Inquisition. The resident of the Holy Office does not only let the book pass, but to make an amount of almost unprecedented compliments in the license that authorizes the publication of the work. If we go to the opinions emitted by the same rear, there is no other work on which he is as compliments as it was with the epic of Camões.
In Indonesia, he befriended a slave on the island of Java.
Camões was, at least once, on the island of Ternate, Indonesia, in the archipelago of molucas, at a time when there were conflicts motivated by an extremely cruel Portuguese captain towards the king or sultan of Ternate, which originated a kind of war between the Portuguese and the places. Camões has a song that describes the island of Ternate. We do not know if it was at this time, or in another passage to the Far East, that Camões turned on to a Jaú, or Javanese, but could not be exactly from the Far East, but a freed slave who had been linked by friendship to Camões. And this is because in one of the first biographies of Camões it reads that Jaú, with the Christian name António, asked for alms at night. This freedom of movements of a slave indicates that he would probably be a freed slave. He asked for alms to Camões, for himself and the mother of Camões, with whom Camões will have lived in recent years of life.</description><pubDate>2025-06-26 23:30:50</pubDate></item><item><title>Filipe de Saavedra, Teacher: “A Camões Interpretative Center in Macau is missing”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/05/21/filipe-de-saavedra-docente-falta-um-centro-interpretativo-de-camoes-em-macau/</link><description>Professor at the University of Science and Technology of Macao and a scholar of the presence of Camões in Asia, Philip de Saavedra understands that Macau is missing an interpretative center about the poet's life and work. The academic spoke yesterday at the National Library in Lisbon, about the correspondence written by Luís de Camões in Asia
 
He participated yesterday at the “from Lisbon to Goa: What the Letters of Camões” participated. What path does the East arise portrayed in these letters, and who were directed?
The letters Camões wrote from Asia are in the order of the dozens. There is in them scholarship, philosophy, and also a lot of humor, sarcasm, and satire of humanist nature. Some were written from Ternate, others from Malaca, Macau, probably others from Cambodia, to recipients in India and Portugal. With the exception of the letters of Goa, where the identification of the writing site is generally present, maping those that were written during the rest of it would be a complex task. They are only given as written in Asia.
Can you give examples of written letters in this context?
I mention here two of the first he sent to the kingdom. The epistle whose first line is “The Poet Simony speaking” was written in January 1554, when Camões has just arrived in Goa, destined for his pupil, D. António de Noronha. It is a very emotional letter, giving it the storm that had plagued the Armada in the Cape of Good Hope, "seeing the death of the before me." Camões survived this limit experience aboard the São Bento ship, the only one to arrive that year to Goa, and which was lost in the turn of the Christmas lands, dying in this second bid the Captain Fernão de Álvares Cabral, and many of those who traveled with him. In addition to the news of his salvation, the poet was equally eager to tell his friend the expedition of D. Afonso de Noronha to Malabar, in which he had taken part in the previous month. In Irenal pages, Camões vehemently condemns the massacre of the few native troops by the “thick armed” of the disproportionate vice-king army. In his radical compliment of peace, the poet calls "true remedy" to the early death that cure the war crazes of those who want to live "by knights", for "who will walk by following the fero Mars always brings their eyes to their danger." Cruelly prophetic words: by irony of fate, at the moment the poet wrote these lines and sent them, that recipient diletus, for whose life he feared, already lay, lying during a military foray in Ceuta on April 29, 1553, only 17 years old.
And the second letter?
A year later, in January 1555, he wrote to a friend a different epistle in tone and in purpose, whose first line is "I wished so much", where he evoked the shock he suffered from the death of D. António, gathering a sonnet that had composed to his memory. It is clear that Camões also had great intimacy with this correspondent, who knew D. António and the poetry of Camões, Petrarch and Boscán. Interestingly, the letter includes some male lines, which Camões says they are mandatory in private letters, containing what can be called a resort conversation, so being worship or scholar did not prevent it if it were "bon vivant".
The presence of Camões in Macau is still wrapped in a certain myth. What are the concrete tests of your presence in the territory?
It is necessary to separate the waters. The landing of Camões in Patane's busty, then called “cave”, is surrounded by a beautiful legendary aura. But the presence of Camões in Macao, this is not involved in "myth", is a factual and historical reality, founded on a wide variety of testimonies, all independent of each other. Insisting on a chronology that contained in the sources, but which was flagrantly erroneous, it was deliberately sought to confuse the doubts that could have about his permanence in the sinned, although unjustified, with false doubts about the poet's stay in Macau, which are laughable and devoid of the minimum foundation. The joke ran a swimming, and little by little it was embedded in the collective imagination, to the point that some less informed people take it for a supposed “discovery” recent. However, nonsense was released in 1907, and soon dismantled in 1911 by Jordan de Freitas. Judge Eduardo Ribeiro put more “points in the iis” in this regard. In your time I will publish the full documentation about the presence of Camões in Macao, putting a definitive end to the mythical “myth”.
What life did Camões in Macau?
We can say that these two years were those of the greatest professional, economic and affective in his life. Is it written poetry? Constantly, as the dimension of the work attests. A significant part of “the Lusíadas” was composed here, although the poem had neither began nor ended in Macao. Not least in his life was that it was in Macao who publicly assumed a relationship with a young Chinese, most exactly the Tanka ethnicity of poor fishermen. This asymmetrical connection is not surprising and with a modest young woman: only disadvantaged families would not prevent daughters from relate to foreigners. This explains the fact that she left with Camões in 1565 to Goa, with concubine status. But the private vessel in which they followed, belonging to Chinese merchants, suffered a wreck by Cambodia, and Camões lost there the “kind lamp I loved so much”. It was only after his death that he would come to chrisma as Denamene, a Greek nymph of the waters, so that she could live forever in the ocean. The Chinese of Macao have a special relationship with Camões, such as the Portuguese and the Macanese.
How is this relationship?
It existed in the eighteenth century in Macao the first monument in honor of Camões, something that in Portugal only began to think about the following century. He even received an inscription on Chinese, and even a Chinese pavilion was built on his sanctuary. The Viscount of Juromenha says that in 1845 the Viceroy of Canton and Imperial Commissioner Ki-A there was worshiped Camões as the “Portuguese Confucius”. And rightly, Camões shares many aspects of the sages of Chinese tradition: he established a dialogue with the masters through the recreation of larger works, cultivated a millennial tradition (he gloss two thousand years prior to his own time), practiced itinerary as a source of "sagesse", said the primacy of poetry, conceived the rivers as mythical entities, even personifying them, even personifying them, even He showed a marked tendency to moralize, and epitomously his thinking in masterful sentences.
What connection did Camões have with Goa?
Unlike Macao, Goa raised in Camões mostly negative feelings. The first impressions he had, like a lawless land in which only the little turns were worse, could not have been worse, as read in the initial letter to which he alluded: "long land, from all the poor honorable grave." In the second letter, he goes on, "I can say that it is the mother of bad villains, and stepmother of honorable men." These impressions would not improve over time, as corroborated the satire that led to the expulsion to Ternate in 1556. Goa, where he became the deputy protected, to fall later in the greatest disfavor under D. Antão de Noronha, was in his texts the inverted mirror of the Kingdom, the corrupt and corrupt Babylon, theil of God, and the betrayal of God, King and the law. In what is not original, as there are other sources that reinforce this Jeremiac and apocalyptic portrait of the capital of the Portuguese East Empire. Remember Bocage: "From the land to worst you are, O goa." This said, obviously that he will also have lived there sweethearts, especially under the viceroyalty of his protectors, and in living with some companions of the poetic lines that then lived there, and which he evokes in the so-called “feast of trovas”. To one of these cultured spirits, the poet Luís Franco, even a copy of his almost complete works, including the 'self of filodemo' that had composed there, that they could be saved if another adversity survived in the kingdom to the kingdom.

Do you think Portugal should pay more attention to your writings, streamlining your work more? How?
In Lisbon it is necessary to build a great literary museum dedicated to Camões and its creations. The ideal place will be the Convent of St. Bento de Xabregas, where his friend Dom António had a grave at the Pantheon of the Line Chapel. Also in Goa the statue of Camões left for exile in the cruelly called “Archaeological Museum”, which is not the appropriate place to end the poetry or image of a poet. Being the greatest intangible heritage of Macao, Camões has been poorly used in this region. multimedia.
What about Macau? Is Camões studied at higher education?
Two students from the Macao University of Sciences and Technology will now defend their master's theses. The first is an in -depth technical study of the translation of Zhang Weim of the Camões Odes. The second runs through the literary survival of the figure of Dinamene in contemporary Portuguese fiction, and are both excellent, bringing novelty.</description><pubDate>2025-05-21 22:42:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
What do you talk about is economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nürburgring Nordschleife is a new favorite stage of Chinese brands</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/01/nurburgring-nordschleife-e-novo-palco-predilecto-das-marcas-chinesas/</link><description>In the middle of the Eifel forest - in German, Eifelwald - Two cars with Chinese enrollment are parked in front of a hotel unit. The scenario appears to be intriguing at first glance, but it is not.
Nürburgring Nordschleife, in Rhineland-Palatinado, already close to the Belgium and Luxembourg border, has become the favorite stage of new Chinese automobile builders to show the world that they can also measure forces with their European, American and Asian rivals with regard to high performance vehicles.
Chinese automotive industry bet is strongly concentrated in NEVs - “New Energy Vehicles” - as part of the strategy for reducing pollution, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and boosting innovation in the automotive industry. China represented almost two thirds of global electric vehicle sales in 2024, and their builders, all relatively new, discuss Taco the Taco with the large traditional builders a piece of this appetizing market.
It is undisputed that the growth of sales of this type of vehicles in the world has not been accompanied at the same speed by the evolution of technology applicable to automobile sport, especially with regard to electric vehicles (EVs).
The World Formula World Championship and is the only truly global competition for electric vehicles, after the fiasco and the premature death of the FIA - FIA etcouring world cup. With no alternatives to affirm their everyday products on the tracks, Chinese brands headed in weight to Nürburgring Nordschleife, known to be one of the favorite places of European car manufacturers to test high performance cars.
The “green hell”, a name given by the legendary pilot Jackie Stewart due to its difficulty and the density of the surrounding forest, is a circuit with over 20 kilometers and 170 curves, combining fast lines, technical sections and sharp unenforcement. Many return records are measured here for sports and super -sports car cars, making Nordschleife an unavoidable reference to car performance.
Chapters for History
In 2017, Nio became known to the western world when it established a record with its EP9 electric supercar. The vehicle completed a circuit of 20.8 km in 6 minutes and 45.90 seconds, becoming the fastest production car at the time to travel the famous Germanic layout.
This feat has evidenced the ability of Nio and Chinese industry to compete with brands established in the high performance cars segment. Two years later, Lynk &amp; Co, the first Chinese brand to win a race in the guide circuit, with model 03 Cyan Concept, a high performance version of the Sedan 03, reached a time back in 7 minutes and 20,143 seconds, setting a new record for four -door cars.
Brands such as Zeekr, MG and Lotus passed the old stage of the Formula 1 German Grand Prix, until, in 2024, Xiaomi arrived with a crash. With a production version of the SU7 Ultra, it registered a time of 7 minutes and 4.957 seconds, surpassing rivals such as Porsche Taycan Turbo GT and Rimac Snowra. To keep up with the sales success of your car, the electronic technology brand was even further: Last month, the Su7 Ultra Prototype, built in partnership with Prodrive, reached an impressive 6-minute and 22.091 seconds, becoming the third fastest car of all time on the circuit, behind only the Porsche 919 Hybrid and Volkswagen ID.R.R.
These results from Xiaomi had a significant impact, both in the western and home press, as well as proof of the international affirmation of an industry that wants to be an undisputed leader with regard to Nev vehicles. On the other hand, Xiaomi took the opportunity to “surf the wave” and launched in the market a special limited edition of Su7 -all -how.
More will come
Nürburgring Nordschleife is part of the Chinese auto industry vocabulary and the trend is for an even stronger presence of Chinese brands in the coming years on the German track.
"I believe it was the decision of Xiaomi that brought greater attention to the definition of records back in Nürburgring," explained Chinese journalist Bruno Qi to HM. “With a huge media influence in China and a high profile CEO like Jun Law, Xiaomi attracted a significant focus on this scenario. After Nio's success, this was another strong performance of a Nürburgring high -performance electric vehicle.”
Xiaomi, which already names a bend of the German circuit, may want to improve its time back, while other Chinese brands seek to follow the trend - even to show off on a respected and good memories.
"Brands like Yangwang (BYD's luxury brand) have also sent their models for time attempts around," says Chinese publication journalist Bec Motorsport. “I think Chinese auto builders have now found a relevant opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of their high performance electrical platforms, and this strategy is already helping to boost sales.” Also, at the end of the day, what weighs is what is sold.</description><pubDate>2025-08-01 01:14:03</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA has already defined what the F4 World Cup will be like</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/25/gp-fia-ja-definiu-como-sera-a-taca-do-mundo-de-f4/</link><description>The Macao Grand Prix hosts the first edition of the FIA Formula 4 World Cup, between November 13 and 16 this year.

At a time when behind the scenes, it is spoken of the possibility of increasing the minimum age of formula 4 to 16 years, the sports regulation stipulates that all pilots must be at least 15 years old, and the birthday is binding. An inscribed pilot may not have participated in more than two races of a championship with any type of monolugar that has been conceived and/or built to achieve a power-to-weight ratio of less than 3.0 kg/hp, which prevents participation in this riders running regional formula seasons or Formula 3.
The sports regulation does not specify technical details, but in previous communications, the FIA had already confirmed that Mintimes - organizer of the F4 Chinese Championship - will be the “unique operator” of the race, together with FFSA (Fédération Française Du Sport Automobile (FFSA), responsible for the world's cup technical support. In practice, all competitors will use Mygale M21-F4 singlesules, recently re-baptized as Ligier JS F422.
These formulas, equipped with 1.3 -liter Turbo Renault engines, will be rented to teams from the interior of China and operated by a single technical team - the same that organizes the French F4 Championship. Pirelli will be the exclusive tire supplier, as is the case with the Macao Grand Prix of Regional Formula and the FIA GT World Cup.
Although the official time of the event has not yet been released, it is known that the World Cup will feature a qualification race played over 8 laps, or at most 60 minutes, most likely on Saturday. The main race will be held on Sunday, with 10 laps or, equally, a maximum of 60 minutes. Prior to that, a 40 -minute free training session will take place, followed by a qualification session with the same duration.
PATACA AND POINTS
About 350,000 patacas in monetary awards will be distributed to the competitors present in this first cup of the world, with the winner of the main race to raise eight thousand US dollars. As a curiosity, all participants will receive three hundred dollars of participation-the same value attributed to the pole-position of Saturday's qualification race and the rider who reaches the highest tip speed during the event.
More important than the monetary awards, the FIA Formula 4 World Cup winner on the streets of Macau will win two points for the super license - points that may be decisive to access the restricted Formula 1 world. The winner will also be forced to attend the FIA awards ceremony, which will take place on December 12 in Tashkentão, USBekistan.</description><pubDate>2025-07-25 05:01:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorsport: FIA continues to dream of a Chinese team at F1</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/15/automobilismo-fia-continua-a-sonhar-com-uma-equipa-chinesa-na-f1/</link><description>It's no secret to anyone: the International Automobile Federation (FIA) would like to have a Chinese team in the F1 World Championship. FIA President Mohammed Ben Suulaym is the first to demonstrate this will.
For the first time since 2015, F1 will receive a 11th team on the starting grid next season, with Cadillac's entry, putting an end to a three-year wait since the US team presented its candidacy following the FIA appeal for demonstrations of interest. As there will be a margin for a 12th team, Ben Suulayem is willing to launch a new process of manifestation of interest, making it clear that an application from China would be welcome.
The entry of a Chinese team would be aligned with F1's strategic efforts to expand its presence in key markets. China's Grand Prix has recently renewed its contract by 2030, consolidating the country's role in the long -term view of the sport.
"We have a 11th team [Cadillac]. I believe we should analyze the performance of this 11th team and then if there is a Chinese [candidacy]-and I will now speak on behalf of Fom [Formula One Management]-they will approve it, because it is about sustaining the business," said the FIA president in a joint interview with several journalists from the automobile sector.
Ben Suulayem made it clear that there is no urgent need to have a 12th team. However, given F1's upward trajectory in recent years, the addition of another team to the starting grid, especially one from China, would further increase the call of the sport in the largest business market on the planet. "If there is a team from China, let's say, and the first to approve - and I'm 100% sure that it will approve it - would no longer make money with China's entry? I believe yes," he said.
A huge market for exploring
The Chinese automotive market is incomparable, producing more than 30 million vehicles a year - more than the United States of America, Japan and India together. In addition, China has contributed to the increase in the fan base in sports, with over 150 million fans and more than 1 million new followers on Chinese social networks, increasing the total to 4.3 million. F1 fan segmentation analysis itself has revealed that more than half of fans in the country have started following the sport in the last four years. Interestingly, the audience is younger than the average F1 supporters and more diverse, with a 50% female demography.
For Ben Sulayem, it is more than just increasing the number of teams: it is to unite the main global markets under the F1 flag, because the number of Chinese sponsors and partners in the “Queen Class” of motor sport is currently limited, boiling down to the official Aston Martin Content Creation Partner, and Sauber's Sensetime. The presence of the Chinese brand Yili, which in the meantime came out, and the Sensetime in the Sauber universe was undoubtedly linked to the fact that Zhou Guanyu, the first full -time Chinese driver at F1, running the Swiss team at the time the agreements were signed.

Geely in pole-position
The dream of a Chinese team may still be in an embryonic phase, but with the support of the president of FIA and the growing focus of the sport in China, the view of a Chinese brand on F1's starting grids may be getting closer to reality. A Chinese brand like Geely could naturally fit into F1, taking into account its global presence and the fact that it stops international brands reputed such as Volvo or Lotus, appearances as a shareholder at Aston Martin and Mercedes-Benz Group, and Joint Ventures with Renault.
It is also worth mentioning that, recently, Lotus Cars, owned by Geely, recovered the name Team Lotus, bringing together its competition programs with official support, partner teams, lotus coup championships and drivers development programs. According to the company, the Renaissance of Team Lotus "means our commitment to global competition and the culture of motorized sport." For now, this is limited to GT cars, but one cannot help but imagine where it may evolve in the future.
Lotus Group has been the property of Geely since 2017. Team Lotus team was a constant presence in Formula 1 between 1954 and 1994, and there were some attempts to reactivate the name linked to their historic past in F1, attempts that ended just over nine years ago. In addition to the Lotus Sports Program and others of regional or national work, Geely is also present in Auto Sport with Lynk &amp; Co, at FIA TCR World Tour, and through its partnership with Renault, as a engine supplier, in the Chinese F4 Championship.</description><pubDate>2025-08-15 16:34:43</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FR World Cup will have a new car in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/08/06/gp-taca-do-mundo-de-fr-tera-novo-carro-em-2026/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) has recently revealed some details about the future of the Regional Formula (FR), the discipline that currently gives body to the Macao Grand Prix and which, from 2026, will finally have a new monolugar - faster and more safe
 
Initially baptized by FIA as F3 Regional, the now designated regional formula (FR) is above the Formula 4 Formula 4 National Competitions and FIA Championship, which, in turn, supports the FIA Formula 2 Championship and Formula 1. Last year, the FIA decided that this category was the one that best filed the Guide Circuit, thus ending four decades of Formula 3 Macao Award.
Last week, the regulator of world motorsport and the Italian national sports association has jointly presented the future monoligue that will compete in the European regional FIA (FREC in English) regional formula championship and will succeed the current freka. The fact that the acronym has lost the letter “A” is due to the exit of the Alpine brand as a partner and engine supplier to the championship. FRECA premiered in 2019, succeeding the Formula Renault Eurocup. In recent seasons, more than 160 pilots, representing 44 nationalities and 22 teams, participated in the championship. This category has gained importance in the FIA monologene pyramid, having as old pilots former champion Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Isack Hadjar, Gabriel Bortoleto and Franco Colapinto-all of them now militate in Formula 1.
The competition will have the FIA support seal and should be the largest supplier of teams and pilots for the FR World Cup of the Macao Grand Prix from next year. FIA involvement in the competition is intended to generate more revenues for it, something that may have reflexes on the price scale. The FR championships in the Americas and Japan, as well as the FIA -certified trophies in the Middle East and Oceania will continue, and progressively will introduce the new car produced in Italy.
FIA President Mohammed Ben Suulayem believes this project "will create a stronger and more support for young pilots. With the full support of the FIA regions and a clear progression vision, we are taking an important step to ensure the future of junior monoliga pyramid." Former Ralis pilot and today maximum leader of automobile sports, who was recently in the territory for the FIA general assembly, said that “accessibility, international credibility and cost efficiency are at the center of this initiative.”
New car promises more
The new Tatuus T-326, the second-generation FR monolugar, is equipped with a 3-cylinder and 1.6 liter Toyota engine, which debits 270 horsepower and 360 Nm of torque, specially adapted and prepared by ATM-Autotechnic Motori. The T-326 represents a natural evolution of the T-318 model, the Tatuus monolugar that defined most FR championships worldwide and says goodbye to the big stages next November, during the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix. The second edition of FR's FR World Cup will continue to use the Tatuus T-318 Monolugar, motorized by a 1.75-liter Turbo Alpha Romeo block, also prepared by ATM-Autotechnic Motori, but the Italian brand has failed to manufacture.
The future car, which will use a new special tire built by Pirelli, will have a fully redesigned aerodynamic profile, shaped by the new FIA technical regulations for the category and inspired by the latest trends in the top categories of single -molding. The result is a general increase in performance, better aerodynamic efficiency and reduction of turbulence effect, which will facilitate overtaking.
Main improvements include weight reduction, optimized direction rack and magazine suspension, offering greater lightness and ease of driving. Security remains a key pillar in all Italian tatus projects, and this car is no exception. Chassis further increased its impact resistance. Crucial elements such as front and rear impact absorption structures, anti-intrusion panels and roll bar have been updated to meet the latest safety standards. In addition to safety, the cockpit is designed to maximize pilot's comfort and ergonomics, welcoming both men and women in a wider range of heights, ensuring the best conditions to compete on track.</description><pubDate>2025-08-06 23:59:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Lamborghini | Charles Leong returns to the Academy of Young Pilots</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/20/lamborghini-charles-leong-regressa-a-academia-de-jovens-pilotos/</link><description>The Lamborghini Squadra Corso, the Automobili Lamborghini competition division, will give Macau pilot a new opportunity for Macao Charles Leong Hon Chio, who was again selected to join the Italian -brand prestigious youth academy, the “Young Driver Program”
 
Charles Leong, who participates for the second year in a row in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia, by SJM team Theodore Racing, currently leads the Pro category, with four wins in six races already played. This weekend, the territory pilot travels to South Korea to compete in the fourth race of the Sant'Agata Bolognese builder's Asian competition season, a small locality in the Emilia-Romanha region in northern Italy, between Modena and Bologna.
In a statement, the transalpina brand made known that, in all, selodes were pre-selected pilots of the various Super Trofeo championships and five of the various international GT3 championships, including Portuguese Rodrigo Testa, for the annual Lamborghini Squadra Corso program, which focuses on both track and outside performance. The twenty -one pilots will be accompanied and evaluated throughout the season, with specific analysis of their progression, consistency, experience, professionalism and ability to provide technical feedback. In addition, five additional pilots are part of Lamborghini's young professional pilots, receiving direct support from the factory in Sant'Agata Bolognese and Scola Federale ACI Sport, an entity managed by the Italian Federation.
The big news for the 2025 edition of the Young Driver Program is the selection process: it failed to settle only in age criteria, focusing on the most impressive pilots of the first two rounds of the year, based on a classification coefficient covering the three continental championships. The pilots were evaluated by Scoola Federale ACI-Sport chief instructor Niki Cadei, in collaboration with YDP consultants and official Lamborghini drivers Andrea Caldarelli (North America), who has already competed at the Macao Grand Prix, and Marco Mapelli (Europe and Asia), taking into account several performance indicators.
The results of qualification training and racing are thoroughly analyzed, such as track conduct, the pilot's post-end reports and the technical feedback provided to engineers and Squadra corse's technical team. The average score determines the final list of pilots selected for the decisive phase. A group of these young pilots will participate in a dedicated training camp at Lamborghini headquarters in Sant'Agata Bolognese, as well as at the final selection session in Misano. The best of the session will then receive support from Lamborghini Squadra Corso for the 2026 season.
Future is played in Italy
Among Super Trofeo Junior pilots, ten compete in the European series, while the rest come from the American and Asian championships. In addition to Macao's 24 -year -old pilot in Asian representation, Lamborghini also chose Singapore's Ethan Brown and Ireland's Alex Denning, which this year shares the steering wheel with Charles Leong to join this program.
Charles Leong will be evaluated throughout the season, and the final selection - whether or not to integrate Lamborghini's youth professional riders program - will be made in November at the Italian circuit of Misano, after the traditional closing of the Season of the various Super Trofeo, during the Lamborghini world endings. It is recalled that the winner of the Macao Formula 4 Grand Prix in 2020 and 2021 was part of this program last year, but was not selected. At the time, the final assessment took place at the Jerez circuit in Spain - an unknown layout, unlike his opponents.</description><pubDate>2025-07-20 15:23:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Great Bay Race learned more pilots for the GP</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/07/11/corrida-da-grande-baia-apurou-mais-pilotos-para-o-gp/</link><description>The GT Cup Races - Great Bay Race, integrated at the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix, ended with a double journey at the Pingtan Speed Festival last weekend of June. Of the twenty -eight vacancies assigned by the first two GT Cup races, only one Macao pilot got a direct entrance at the great sports event of November.
Following the success of the two races played under the China Formula 1 Grand Prix, both 30 -minute races of the GT4 Chinese Championship had a total of 21 participants at the event held at the International Circuit of Lago Ruyi in Pingtan. This picturesque track, located in Fujian province, replaced the Zhuhai International Circuit, initially included in the provisional calendar released in January, but did not confirm the holding of his event.
In Pingtan's semiurban layout, Chinese pilot Han Lichao won both races behind his Toyota GR Supra GT4 EVO2. In two very lively races, Kevin Leong Ian Veng (BMW M4 GT4) was the only Macau pilot scoring, having reached a sixth and eighth place, respectively.
Although only one Pilot of the Misrem has guaranteed the direct determination, it is possible that more riders in the territory will align on the GT - Great Bay Race, integrated in the Macao Grand Prix. This is because only 21 pilots scored in these four races, which means that even if all these pilots are signed up for the guide circuit race, seven vacancies will still be filled.
In addition to Kevin Leong, seven other pilots from Macau - Miguel Law, Wong Cheng Tou, Fok Wai Ming, Lao Kim Hou, IP Un Hous, Wong Wai Hong and Law Kit Meng - participated in at least one of the two qualification events and may be repaired for local test if the sports committee's sports committee of the Macau Grand Prix so.
Among the riders are some known names of the region's motorsport, such as Darryl O'Young, double winner of the Macau GT Cup; Chen Weian, 12 -hour separate winner; Liu Kaishun, Chinese F4 runner-up; Daniel Lu, former Champion of the Porsche Carrera Asia Cup; or Luo Kailuo, winner of the GT Cup - Great Bay Race at Macao's 70th Grand Prix.
It's not over yet
This debut season, Sro GT Cup still has two more pointed events, the last, naturally, played in the iconic Guide Circuit. The competition, which has the support of the Macao General Automobile Association - China (AAMC), has reached its intermediate point, and the struggle for the title is in the red. Prior to the mandatory visit to Macau, from 17 to 19 October, the GT4 category cars will compete at the first event held on the streets of Yizhuang, in Beijing.
Beijing's Citadino Circuit is one of the most anticipated auto events in the Popular Republic of China and represents an excellent opportunity for Macao GT4 riders - and not only to prepare for the big challenge that are the curves and countercurns of the territory layout.</description><pubDate>2025-07-11 00:45:06</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
