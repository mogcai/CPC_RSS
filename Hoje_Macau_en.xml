The fight against the flames was hampered by the wind, since several doors were open
 
Two women were transported yesterday to the Conde São Januário Hospital Center, following a fire in the Lake Building in Taipa.

According to CB's second commander, Lam Chon Sang initially, the authorities were warned for a 10th floor fire.

The second-commander of the CB also indicated as another of the main difficulties in fighting the fire the delay of about 15 minutes to connect the hoses to water supply.

The person responsible for the workers' clinic understands that the authorities should combat the popularity of the drug with an awareness campaign directed to the youngest
 
The interception of a woman, coming from Macao, at the Sheung Wan ferry terminal in Hong Kong with an electronic cigarette with ethomidate, the anesthetic drug known as “space oil”, made sound alarms in Macao. The Federation of Macao Workers 'Associations (Faom) yesterday issued a statement on the subject, in which the head of the workers' clinic and a member of the drug fighting committee, Hoi Sun San, called for the criminalization of the drug, like that that happens in Hong Kong and in the interior of China.
Hoi Sun San argues that the case aroused the concern of all sectors of society and served as an alert to the need to regulate emerging drugs in Macao. The guardian expects the government to intensify efforts to combat drug crimes and the education of residents to recognize and remain away from the harmful effects of drugs, especially new types of substances and the legal consequences of trafficking in nurser.
Ethomidate is a hypnotic anesthetic administered in surgeries that has become one of the chemical components used in the execution of a lethal injection death penalty in the US state of Florida.

Lawyer Loi I Man, cited by the same statement from Faom, stressed that ethomyidate was included in the list of psychotropic substances under the control of the interior of China in October 2023, establishing drug criminalization.
In Hong Kong, the law criminalized “space oil” on February 14. Trafficking and manufacture has been punished with a maximum penalty of perpetual imprisonment and a fine of up to 5 million dollars of Hong Kong, while inauguration and consumption are punished with a maximum penalty of seven years in prison and a $ 1 million fine of dollars Hong Kong.
“Space Oil” has gained popularity and became the third most consumed drug in Hong Kong, after cocaine and cannabis, leading John Lee's government to act. The head of the workers' clinic stressed that authorities cannot ignore the damage that new drugs can cause in society, especially among the younger ones that are more susceptible to bad influences. In addition, from a medical point of view, Hoi Sun San said the new drugs, such as “space oil”, are highly addictive, causing not only functional disability but also permanent damage.
However, the member of the drug struggle committee understands that it is necessary to go beyond the legislation, combating the phenomenon through the intensification of preventive education and the sensitization of the population, especially young people.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 05:00:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Teaching | Chinese universities rise in ranking by disciplines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/ensino-universidades-chinesas-sobem-em-ranking-por-disciplinas/</link><description>Chinese universities have risen at the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025” in various areas, although in arts and humanities Asia remains short of other continents.

According to a statement widespread by the company through its News Portal Alizila, the announced amount exceeds the combined investment of the last decade in these two fields, identified by the group as strategic, along with the traditional electronic trade business.
When presenting the results of the third fiscal quarter, on Friday, the group's CEO Eddie Wu revealed that the company intended to make “greater investment” in areas such as AI and cloud data services, although not had specified amounts.
According to Alibaba, the measure "reinforces its commitment to long -term technological innovation" and "underlines the company's bet on AI -driven growth and its role as a leading [data services in] cloud."
At the conference with analysts who followed the presentation of the results, Wu stated that AI is a “unique opportunity in a generation” and noted that achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI, a type of AI that would equal human intelligence) will be the main objective in the long run of the company.
In his opinion, AI's ability to replicate human labor, both intellectual and physical, “could remodel” industries worldwide, leading “significant transformations” in economy and technology.
The CEO recalled that a growing part of the AI-generated data will be processed and distributed through cloud networks, positioning Alibaba AI subsidiary, Alibaba Cloud, as "a key infrastructure supplier."
Artificial future
During the third tax quarter, the adjusted revenue from the cloud intelligence subsidiary increased by 11 percent over the previous year, while IMA revenue related to AI experienced its sixth consecutive three -digit growth quarter.
In recent weeks, Alibaba has announced a pact to incorporate its QWEN model into Apple's iPhones in China, and there has been speculation that it may be interested in becoming investor at Deepseek, the AI ​​Chinese platform that shook the sector.
“Looking to the future, the growth of revenues in the cloud intelligence division will continue to accelerate, driven by AI,” explained Wu, last Friday, in a message that accompanied the disclosure of the company's results, sent to the Bolsa de Hong Kong values, which exceeded analysts expectations.

February 2025
The Chinese tradition says that the classic works of culture were not just four books: The Analects (《論語/1 论语》 lunyǔ), the book of Mâncio (《孟子》 mèngzǐ), the great study (《大學/大学》 dàxué) and The Doctrine of the Meio (《中庸》 Zhōngyōng), and five classics: The Classic of Mutations (《易經易经》 Yì Jīng), The Book of Odes (《詩經诗经》 Shījīng), The History (《史記/太史公記 // 史记/太史公记》 Shǐjì/tàishǐ gōngjì), the rites (《禮記礼记》 lǐjì), the annals of spring and autumn (《春秋》 Chūnqiū)), but four books and six classics, because there was one more relative to the music (樂經/乐经) Yuè Jīng, which in the meantime was lost.
However, “music” (樂/乐 yuè) is so important to the Chinese that their synogram is confused in the written form with that of “joy” (樂/乐 lè).  From an etymological point of view, it is the pictogram of a musical instrument, whose base represents the wood part and the top the strings of it.  This, for the satisfaction that raises when it is touched, will serve by extension of meaning to figure the synogram of joy.
Music before belonging to humanity, depends on the deities of the Chinese popular animist religion and natural forces such as wind or biological beings such as birds, or mythological like fenices.  It is known that the yellow emperor (黄帝 Huángdì) ruled in a mythical antiquity that dates back to organized Chinese civilization. But this, according to one of the great Taoist philosophers of Chinese antiquity, Lie Yukou (列御寇 Liè Yùkòu ”) in the homonymous work Liezi (列子“ Lièzǐ ·) puts the emperor to make spiritual trips in which he finds feminine deities of matriarchal times, as Huaxu (華胥/华胥 Huáxū), mother of the first Chinese emperor Fuxi (伏羲 Fuxī) and, therefore, ancestral matriarch of all Chinese or even the mysterious mother and/or woman of the ninth sky (九天聖 (圣) 母/九天玄女 jiiǔtān shèngmǔ/jiiǔtān xuanǚ) taught a lot, even in the case of the latter to appreciate music, poetry, having also started by her, who had a human face and Phoenix Body, in the Arts of Love.
As for Phoenix is ​​the bird that symbolizes eternal life and peace; When the gray itself is reborn, it transports the hope of whole, renewed and peaceful beings, as it only arises in the world in times of tranquility and harmony. But it is also in close relationship with the music, because it is a mythological bird that sings, such as the wind, whose sound is composed for the Chinese by the melodious beating of the wings of the birds, when it comes to breeze, or the beating of the same in storm.
Linglun (伶倫/伶伦 Ling Lun) created the twelve shades following a request from the yellow emperor, which after being properly polite and trained his musical ear for the mysterious woman of ninth sky, was bored in the trips of inspection by Earth with The monotony of melodies. This great musician rushed to fulfill orders and surrendered with soul and heart to listen to all the sounds of nature to obtain the inspiration required to the mission. But it was in the Kunlun Sacred Mountain (崑崙山/昆仑山 Kūnlún Shān) that he obtained the lighting necessary for the creation of twelve shades by resorting to twelve bamboo tubes. How did he verify the right tones? “Loading the twelve bamboo tubes, Linglun reached the foot of the Kunlun mountain to hear the song of the Phoenix. When the birds sang, the male gave six shouts and the female answered them with six others. Linglun compared the twelve screams with his sounds and found that there was a perfect match between them. ” (Wang and Alves, 2009, 48)
He had reached his goal. The shades followed the model of the Phoenices, when he presented his creation to the Yellow Emperor, having been precisely rewarded with the title of God of Music [音樂 (乐) 之神 Yīnyuè Zhī Shén] and the world has since filled with More beautiful melodies.
Going now to philosophy, the cosmos faced as a mysterious musical instrument is one of the favorite metaphors of one of the great Taoist philosophers, the prince of Huainan, Liu an [劉 (刘) 安 Liú'ān, 179? -122 BC] It leaves us a work of the early days of the Han Dynasty, entitled Huainanzi (《淮南子》 Huáinánzǐ). The work is known in the Chinese tradition also with the title of (《淮南子鴻烈》 Huáinánzǐ Hóngliè), whose meaning is “the radiant light of Master Huainan”, having been the sixth chapter translated by Canadian synologist Charles Le Blanc, under the Title Huainanzi 淮南子 Philosophical Synthesis in Early Han Thought, containing the suggestive Subtitle The Idea of ​​Resonance (Kan-Ying 感應) with a Translation and Analysis of Chapter Six.
Suppose that the whole universe is linked, in the manner of the ropes of an instrument, spreading the sound, echoing and resonating when it touches on a ropes, will have its western counterpart in the mysticism of the Pythagorean pre-Socratic philosopher and its assumption of the “music of the spheres”, that is, the melody produced by the stars in their heavenly trajectories.
Returning to the Master of Huainan, he is informed in section II of the IX of the sixth chapter, that “the mutual response of things belonging to the same category is deeply mysterious and extremely subtle” (BLANC, 1985, 116), to which the text corresponds to the text Original is in Appendix 1 (Blanc, 1985, 221-215): “夫物類之相應玄妙深微知不能論” (6/ 3a.5) 2. These lines can be explained by resorting to another postulate, “the mutual influence of spiritual qì 3 (天神氣 shén qì)” “” (6/4a. 1), whose visible action manifests itself in the similarity of the outer forms of things, But also in the complementary game of the female and masculine forces that make them creative and transforming, and the superior action, as the Taoists believe, is based on the invisible mutual response and Silent (相應 Xiāngyìng), that is, not discursive, which does not preclude what is intuitive and melodious.
The mutual resonance is sustained by a complementary game of the energies yin (陰/阴 yīn) and yang (陽/阳 yáng) at the most varied levels, guided by the principle of causality, which acts between similar and different beings, because it arises O Qì enable and unite what is distinct, in a perfect resonance, so as to figure the cosmos as Taiji or “Supreme last” (太极/太極 tàijí). Thus, section IV of Chapter VI is achieved, where musical resonance (6/6b.9-11) is exposed, which works metaphorically to introduce universal resonance, implying a “great immersion” in the “supreme harmony”, impossible to explain (Blanc, 1985, 138). We are told that an tuner of Sè (瑟), an instrument of Chinese strings with 25 strings (vaguely recalling an Arabil), when touching a rope, will obtain the mutual harmony of the same rope in another instrument. However, “if someone changes the tuning of a rope so that it does not respond to any of the five notes, but when touching it gets a resonance with the 25 strings, then there is a difference with regard to the sound, succeeding that it was evoked that to govern all others. ” (Ibidem) “改調一弦其於無音無所比鼓之而二十五弦皆應此未始” (6/6a.11).
The sage, holy, or supreme musician will be one who can put himself in a direct intuitive connection with Tao (道 道), without herself being able to provide the reasons for it. Dip in the numenal world, play and mix essences, becomes what you want and lives in mutual resonance, absolute and total musical, with all that exists, not just relative to your "similar."
There is a music story for Guqin (古琴 Gǔqín), another instrument of seven -string Chinese strings, told by Taoist philosopher Liezi in the chapter of the previously mentioned homonymous work, yellow emperor, 11th section, (《列子 黄帝》第十一 黄帝》第十一部分 Lièzǐ · huángdì ”dì shíyī bùfèn), which illustrates this universal resonance, easier To obtain to those who have a spontaneous mind, as it succeeds children, and as the founder recalls Taoism Laozi (老子 lǎozǐ), the perfect heart (心 xīn) is that of a newborn. In the story that I present my translation below, the protagonist is a boy with whom birds play naturally, but when his father asks him to capture one of them in order to entertain himself, the birds distance themselves, That is why the score for Guqin calls itself “the distance from water owls” 《鷗鷺忘機/鸥鹭忘机》 ōuu lù wàng jī 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgte7wzut1y
原文 Original text (classic Chinese)
海上之人有好漚鳥者 ， 每旦之海上 ， 從漚鳥遊 ， 漚鳥之至者百住而不止。其父曰：「吾聞漚鳥皆從汝遊 ， 汝取來 ， 吾玩之。」明日之海上 ， 漚鳥舞而不下也。故曰：至言去言 ， 至為無為。齊智之所知 ， 則淺矣。5
Contemporary Chinese
海边有个喜欢鸥鸟的人 ， 每天早上到海上去 ， ， ， 跟鸥鸟玩耍 “我听说鸥鸟都爱跟你游玩 ， 你抓一只来 ， 我玩玩。 ”第二天他来到海上 ， 鸥鸟都在空中飞翔而不下来。所以说：“ 最好的语言是没有语言 ， 最高的作为是没有作为。同别人比试智慧的想法 ， 那是很浅陋的。
There was a boy near the sea that liked a lot of water owls. Every day, he used to stroll by the sea where he played with the birds, more than one hundred.  Once, the father commented: “I heard that the water owls usually play with you, grabs one for me so that I can also entertain with them. “The next morning, by the sea, the birds danced over his head, but they didn't approach. For this reason it is said: “The best speech is speechless, the best action is not acting. If wisdom can be compared, then it is superficial! ”

This time the choice falls on the pieces of Lúcia Lemos, Carlos Morais José and Rita Machado
 
The Vila da Taipa Cultural Association presents, from this Wednesday, a new exhibition. This is “Show-off 3.0”, which as the name implies is the third edition of a show of local collectors, that is, what is presented to the public are works of art from Macao personalities or residing in the territory, instead of exposing themselves the work of an artist.
Thus, “Show-off 3.0” has pieces acquired by Lúcia Lemos, founder of the Creative Macau Gallery; Carlos Morais José, director of HM and author; and Rita Machado, architect. This project is born after verifying a “cultural influence brought to the community by the first exhibition of the series”.
According to a statement from the organization, this trio of personalities "shares the impressive collections that have accumulated over the years, both local and international, including works of art that adorn the most intimate spaces of their homes."
In this show are explored “ideas related to art collecting, aiming to promote collecting as a cultural good that starts from an individual initiative, but can also widen the sense of community, foster its vitality and add diversity to economies places ”. The organization of this exhibition considers that collecting art also enhances trade itself in this segment, besides “fostering local and international talent”, and in “Show-off 3.0”, as in the other editions, “aspects of collector's personality ”.
Frames so I want you
Lúcia Lemos, who for years has been at the head of Creative Macau, presents “a collection composed mainly by vibrant and colorful paintings of local and foreign artists”. “Lúcia Lemos has been involved in promoting local artists for over two decades, through the interpretation of various means, including painting, graphic design, 3D art, photography and cinema. She is also a director of the International Short Festival Shortages Sound &amp; Image Challenge since 2010. Being a plastic artist herself, who has developed her abilities in black and white photography and video, her special relationship with the images results from the many years of Exhibition to the artistic environment of the Portuguese city of Porto ”, highlights the organization.
Following is Carlos Morais José, a degree in Anthropology, but always dedicated himself to journalism, being director of HM for several years. In addition, he founded several publishers, namely Cod and Books do Meio, and the latest literary editing project is the editor “Grão-Fala”, based in Lisbon, with the focus of editing works on Chinese and Asian culture in Portuguese. He is also a poet and author.
“Carlos Morais José's collection refers to a subtle and complex relationship between a scholar and a gongshi who sees stones- rocks with a particular aesthetic beauty- which at the unlawful look appear to be just decorative stones but that lead the sneelful If on issues that transcend your appearance, ”he is described.
Rita Machado, architect linked to the Atelier Impromptu Projects, presents works of art that are based on "in relationships she has maintained with many local and international artists, and with some of which has established lasting friendships."
Rita Machado “is interested in the intersections between Western and Eastern culture, urban design and architectural design”, having graduated in architecture at the University of Porto with the thesis “Macau, City (In) Finite”.
João Ó, architect and president of the Vila da Taipa Cultural Association, described to be “an honor to invite three art collectors to show their various art collections in Vila da Taipa, after the success of our experimental exhibitions in the last two years”.
"This rare and special exposure aims to explore the nature of collecting and raise visually stimulating conversations about the cultural possessions of individuals with very specific and highly personal interests," he said. The show can be seen until April 30, intending to “further reinforce the position of Taipa village as one of Macau's main cultural and artistic destinations, underlining its invaluable contribution to the promotion of cultural and creative industries in the territory” .</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Study | Digital insomnia treatment can combat depression</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/estudo-tratamento-digital-de-insonia-pode-combater-depressao/</link><description>An unprecedented study developed by several universities, including the Chinese Hong Kong University and the University of Beijing, concluded that cognitive behavioral therapy through mobile phone applications can help combat young people by monitoring insomious. The rate of disease reduction is about 40 percent
 
The study “Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Effectiveness Based on insomnia for insomnia in the prevention of Major depressive disorder in insomnia and subclinical depression: an random clinical trial” [Effectiveness of App-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia On Preventing Disorder In Youth with Insomnia and Subclinical Depression: Randomized clinical trial] promises answers to the treatment of cases of depression in the younger ones.
The work, published by PLOS MEDICINE magazine and developed by academics from various universities in Hong Kong and China, including the University of Hong Kong, Chinese Hong Kong University or the University of Beijing, concludes that it is possible to reduce, in about 40 percent, cases of depression in young people using a mobile phone application that monitors insomnies, a usual symptom in whom it suffers from the illness. The data were presented at the end of last week in Hong Kong.
To reach the results, a random sample of more than 700 young Chinese from the interior of China and Hong Kong with insomnia disturbance and depressive symptoms, aged 15 to 25 years, who underwent testing with application for six weeks.
Thus, “this controlled and random study evaluated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for application based on application (TCC-I) in preventing the future appearance of Major Depressive Disturbance (MDD) in young people” can be read. This at a time when "more and more evidence suggests that insomnia plays an important role in the development of depression," in this investigation "intervention in insomnia as a promising approach to prevent depression in young people."
Thus, “applications based TCC-I is effective in preventing the future appearance of major depression and improving the results of insomnia among young people with insomnia and subclinical depression”. The study also concludes that “these results underline the importance of visiting insomnia to prevent the appearance of DMG [a type of depression] and enhance the need for greater disclosure of digital TCC-I to promote sleep and mental health in young population ”.
It is also concluded that the TCC-I based on applications "not only improved night insomnia symptoms, but also reduced daytime fatigue and led to greater change to maturity."
More than 700 young people analyzed
After testing the application of TCC-I, base clinical interviews were conducted over a period of six to 12 months to understand the results in participants and monitor symptoms. We spoke, in the period between September 9, 2019 and November 25, 2022, of 708 participants, of which 407 was women (57 percent), with an average ages of 22 years. The study also points out that “37 participants, 10 percent, in the intervention group and 62 participants, 18 percent, in the control group developed new mood disturbances over the 12 months of follow -up”.
In turn, the group that was subject to CBT-I based on mobile phone application, that is, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, presented “rates of remission of insomnia disturbance higher than post-control groups intervention ”within one year. In addition, the same group "reported a greater decrease in depressive symptoms than post-intervention controls and over six months of follow-up." The authors of the study understand that "insomnia was a mediator of the effects of intervention on depression", and no adverse events related to interventions were reported. "
The authors left for this study with some proven ideas that insomnia is one of the main causes for depression. "Emerging data on insomnia intervention, especially cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (TCC-I), have shown promising results in insomnia relief and depressive symptoms in patients with insomnia," he reads.
Existing investigations focus on adults and elderly, so it was important to analyze this matter among the younger ones.
"In addition, there are few studies with appropriate statistical power to demonstrate the preventive effect of TCC-I on depression, both at symptoms and disturbances," explains the study authors, stressing that "little is known about whether digital intervention of insomnia can potentially prevent youthful depression ”.
Important meanings
The study also points out that cognitive behavioral therapy for applications based on insomnia is a viable and effective intervention to prevent future depression at both symptoms and disturbances in young people. ” However, further studies are recommended to explore “the integration of application-based TCC-I in clinical practice to improve accessibility and prevent depression among the young population”.
It is also mentioned the need for more clinical trials “to explore the potential benefits of adapting digital interventions on sleep in relief and depression prevention”, in order to “move towards personalized and staggered care approaches to community".
Limitations are referred to in this study published in “PLOS Medicine”, namely “the inclusion of a mixture of individuals with and without prior depression, and a limited sample of adolescents, although there was an adequate global sample”.
To the Hong Kong press, the study authors spoke of the importance of these results and how they can constitute new tools in future treatments of the disease. Quoted by The Standard HK, Chen Si-Jing, first author of the Postdoctoral Research and Psychiatry Department of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the study “shows that Digital TCC-i is effective in preventing the onset future of severe depression, with satisfactory effectiveness ”. Wing Yun-Kwok, director of the Li Chiu Kong family sleep evaluation unit, indicated that future studies will focus on digital intervention on insomnia in clinical practice.
The unprecedented character of this study in Asia still gives him greater importance. According to Lu Lin, an academic at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and president of the PKU Sixth Hospital, to date "no investigation in Asia had been carried out on the effectiveness of this therapy."</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:07:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Macao Platform seen in the context of Chinese foreign policy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/19/diplomacia-plataforma-de-macau-vista-no-contexto-da-politica-externa-chinesa/</link><description>In "Paradiplomacy in China: Macao's role in relations between sino-Portuguese countries," Xu Heng Wang concludes that the role of platform with Lusophony "can be seen with extension of China's foreign policy." However, the MSar presents its own ideas, without “complete obedience to the central government”, indicates the academic
 
Macao's diplomatic role in the relationship with China and Portuguese -speaking countries was the focus of Xu Heng Wang's doctoral thesis defended in January at the University of Coimbra (UC) Faculty of Economics. In “Paradiplomacia in China: the role of Macau in relations between the Sino-Portuguese-speaking countries”, the author argues that, regarding the role of Economic and Commercial Platform of MSA in Beijing's connection and Portuguese-speaking countries, there are A certain extent of Chinese foreign policy, but at the same time ideas of the local authorities.
"Although the role of Macao as an economic and commercial platform can be seen as an extension of China's foreign policy, this does not mean that Macau is in a state of complete obedience to the central government," is referred to in research work.
Although it is stressed that “it is difficult to discern Macao's desire to develop, it must be mentioned that Macau has his own ideas about the course of his development”, namely in relation to the game and the entire economic structure.
“Macao has long foresaw that the structure of his economy would be unbalanced and that the game would be dominant. Authorities and academics have also made many debates on the issue of unsustainable development based on the game industry. At the same time, Macau is also very aware of its advantages in terms of cultural integration, having carried out the construction of a historic and cultural city, becoming a tourist attraction. ”
Between the own ideas and what is defined in the field of foreign policy by Beijing, there is "a direction of the development of Macao which, basically, is consistent with the role that the central government has conceived to Macao."
In this context, the author concludes that “the interests of Macao and the central government are basically the same”, being “a special case of paradiplomacy in China”, due to the implementation of politics “one country, two systems” in the territory and of high degree of autonomy that gives you in several areas.
THE ROLE OF THE MACAU FORUM
Xu Heng Wang took a different approach on this issue, not resorting to traditional international relations theories, because “Macao interactions involve both state and non-state actors,” so these theories “do not provide an accurate explanation from the role of Macao ”. In this way, and to understand the role of Macau in the relations between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, the idea of ​​paradiplomacy with Guanxi theory, a term used to describe social, economic or political relations that can enhance business or others was combined to describe to describe to describe to describe to describe business or others Benefits.
Thus, it is mentioned that “the creation of the Macau Forum can be considered one of the prominent paradiplomatic activities”, with “Macao playing a role that mixes its development with the strategic objectives of the Chinese central government, especially with regard to countries of countries Portuguese Language ”.
Macao has performed some relevant activities in the relations between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, ”although it is assumed that“ the results have been limited so far ”.
The academic states that these activities are "mainly concentrated in the fields of economics, education, tourism, culture and technology, with political effects that are not yet so evident." In addition, it is pointed out that "the influence of Macau on the relations between China and the different Portuguese -speaking countries has varied in intensity." Still, "much of the interaction and cooperation between Macao, China and the Portuguese -speaking countries occurred through the Macao Forum."
Help with objectives
In general terms, the “paradiplomacy of Macau is a complex and fluid process”, and the territory “shows its identity as a world center of tourism and leisure and a characteristic financial center with international activities”, with the aim of “improving the economic structure ”and make a diversification beyond game.
The author highlights fundamental areas such as services for small and medium enterprises, exchange-cultural and formation of bilingual talents. In addition, it is explained that “the central government provides political support to Macau based on its foreign policy needs, with the reinforcement of cooperation” with Portuguese -speaking countries. In these actions, include the Great Bay project, as well as the idea of ​​Macao's establishment as the Renminbi Compensation Center (RMB).
“On the one hand, the central government provides conveniences to Macau and helps [the territory] to establish its identity, 'supported by the mainland China market'. On the other hand, it helps Macau to develop the activity of RMB compensation center for transactions that occur on the Macao negotiation platform. ”
Thus, it denotes the author, "the role of Macao in paradiplomacy, but as an assistant to the implementation of central foreign policy, is also evident." However, "the paradiplomacy of Macao does not only reflect the diplomatic objective of helping the Chinese government to establish relations with Portuguese -speaking countries, but also the improvement of Macau's own international influence."
The doctoral thesis also presents a practical case analysis of Macau's relationship with the most striking Portuguese -speaking countries in the economic relationship with China, namely Angola and Brazil. "For Angola, Macao has played an approach role to China," as the African country needs "foreign investment for the hydroelectric power, infrastructure and agriculture sector." Thus, the binding axis is made at the Macao Forum, where "Angola can establish relations with the Chinese central government and cooperate on investment, in addition to the oil sector."
In addition, "most of China's investment in Angola comes from large companies, while small and medium -sized companies still depend mainly on Macau for commercial cooperation."
In the case of Brazil the situation is slightly different, because “in sino-Brazilian relations, the role of Macau is not obvious”, more “centered around the BRICS”, a group of emerging economies initially founded by Brazil, Russia, India and China , and today has ten member countries.
“Although the first ministerial meeting of the Macao Forum (2003) preceded the first meeting of the BRICS (2009) leaders, the impact of the Macao Forum on Sino-Brazilian Relations is not obviously as good as the established influence through direct meetings . Therefore, in the early days of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, relations between the two countries developed more at national level. ”
It is also highlighted that "although the role that Macao has in the opening of a door to the mainland China market has been established in Brazil's eyes, the impact of Macao on sino-Brazilian relations has not yet become obvious."
It is certain, however, that in recent years "the continuous development of the Macao Forum and the continuous improvement of organizational activities, its attraction to Brazil has become increasingly evident." “As Brazil tries to expand trade, commercial cooperation and investment with China will no longer be concentrated only in national business giants and will be increasingly targeted at private companies,” is still completed.
Regarding Portugal, the “attitude is very positive”, to the existing historical connection. “In many memos and statements signed with China, Macau has been stated to play an increasingly important role as a link between China and Portugal. Portugal and China have great technical cooperation in the domains of new energies, aerospace industry and other technological innovations. There is also a profound relationship of cooperation in the field of education. ”
It is also noteworthy that Portugal “not only signed cooperation agreements in the field of teaching with universities in the interior of China, but also signed several cooperation and exchange agreements with the main universities of Macao”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-19 00:24:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Vocational Education | Alert Study for Human Resources Failures in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/ensino-profissional-estudo-alerta-para-falhas-em-recursos-humanos-na-china/</link><description>A study published in The China Quarterly concludes that there are still many questions to resolve so that technical-professional education in China can respond to human resources needs. The work warns of the “rapid massification” of this type of education, with priority for “number of enrollment over quality”
 
Technical-professional education in China has been popularized, but a recently published study in Cambridge University Press magazine “The China Quarterly”, concludes that there are still gaps to find that courses can actually respond to needs of the country in terms of labor in the industrial sector.
“More Graduates, Fewer Skills? Vocational Education Expansion and Skilled Labar Shortages in China ”[More graduates, less skills? The expansion of vocational education and qualified labor faults in China] is the name of the study developed by Xinmiao Song of the University of Lingnan, and Duudo XU of the University of Hong Kong Department of Sociology.
Academic work draws attention to the “disturbing trend” of “rapid massification of vocational education, which gives priority to the number of enrollments to the detriment of the quality of education” and that “does not respond to the search for skills and hand-based training qualified work ”.
In addition, the authors add to the “adverse consequences for both administrative management and teaching, caused by this scenario. “The development of competences often is up to post-school professional associations and an exclusive group of elite students. However, reform initiatives, such as the Manual Arts Campaign and competency contests, benefit only a few, without improving the prospects of employment of the student population in general. ”
Thus, the two academics argue that “more attention to the tensions inherent to China's teaching and vocational training system”, because “only when there is a deeper understanding of the underlying causes to the ineffective training of competences in vocational schools China can achieve its national objective of industrial modernization ”.
The study was developed in two vocational schools, and interviews were conducted to 104 students. In addition, ethnographic data of four doctoral projects were used in the area of ​​vocational education, developed between October 2017 and December 2020.
It is also noted that the country needs “increasingly urgent” of qualified workers “due to world economic competition”. However, "despite the massive expansion of the teaching and vocational training system in the last two decades, there is still a significant deficit of qualified labor," there is "debates about the ineffectiveness of vocational education." These focus above all on, “in the absence of institutional synergies between teaching and industry, but they often ignore the conflicts inherent to the vocational education system and the processes of competency training at the micro level”.
Practical difficulties
To the “micro level”, that is, in schools, the authors denote the existence of several difficulties in the effective functioning of these courses in line with the intended results.
In secondary education there is “a delicate balance between the promotion of social equality and the development of skills”. However, "analysis indicates that, in the context of the rapid expansion of secondary education, schools have difficulty effectively harmonizing these objectives."
“In order to maintain a proper student body, schools and teachers are often obliged to compromise the quality of candidates and teaching standards in the classroom. This situation generates a change in daily pedagogy and school administration to preserve discipline and stability, thus attributing the development of skills and the selection of talents-ideally a mission from the whole school-to extra-curricular professional associations, pursued Just for a few, ”is added.
It is also concluded that “the acquisition of competences is a multifaceted process, shaped by the dynamic interaction between educators and students”, because “the academic preparation of students and their motivations to learn are equally pertinent for the formation of microcompetence, such as the These are the resources of schools and the capabilities of teachers. ”
Thus, “the resolution of the ineffective formation of competencies requires more than the top -to -base initiatives”, “an approach that recognizes the obstacles that students face in the acquisition of skills, as well as their seizures and uncertainties, is necessary. In search of a job ”, it is mentioned.
The authors also talk about “elitism” in some formations related to handicraft courses and “competency contests”. "These initiatives may inadvertently suggest that handicrafts are reserved for a restricted number of people, as competencies contests often remain inaccessible to most vocational education students, both objective and psychologically."
Thus, the authors emphasize that "there is a significant undoing between this elitist approach to the acquisition of competences and the real conditions faced by vocational education students."
“The superficial promotion of manual labor spirit and the exclusivity of skills failed to truly resolve the challenges associated with the acquisition of skills, the search for employment and the commitment to follow technical professions among vocational education students,” is also mentioned.
Still, limitations in the study are referred to, namely the fact that it focuses only on public schools in higher secondary education, and the results may not completely represent other levels of vocational education, such as the higher institutes of vocational training ”.

Numbers from the “Factory of the World”
In the study is the intense industrial development that China has achieved in the last 40 years, emerging as the "factory of the world," as the authors describe, "taking advantage of their demographic dividends."
“However, the intensive model of labor growth has proved unsustainable due to population aging and intense global competition. To escape the 'trap of medium income', the Chinese government has launched a series of industrial modernization actions in the transforming industry and services sectors, ”but“ despite the ambitious agendas for the next decade, the persistent scarcity of qualified workers continues to hinder these efforts, ”is referred to.
By 2020, there were more than 23 million students of vocational education, so “this scarcity of skilled labor is a surprise”, is referred to in the study, which highlights “the substantial efforts and resources that the Chinese government dedicated to Improvement of vocational education in recent years ”.
For example, “Free Secondary Professional Education, the expansion of higher vocational facilities in one million students from 2019 to 2021 and the creation of universities of applied technology” emerged. In addition, the vocational education system watched an unprecedented trajectory, with enrollment in secondary professional schools higher than increasing from 4.56 million in 2004 to 7.11 million in 2009 ″.
In terms of the need for human resources, the study cites data from China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security for 80 cities in the country. “The ministry's quarterly reports revealed that the workfold/person who seeks skilled labor reached a historical peak of 2.0 in early 2020”, and “higher-level qualified workers, technicians and the upper technicians had a particularly high demand. ”
It is also noted that the Ministry of Education provides that the country continues to confront this year, “with a deficit of 30 million qualified workers, which represents a 48 percent break in domains such as materials, the savings of energy and vehicles powered by new energies ”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:25:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Teaching | Chinese universities rise in ranking by disciplines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/ensino-universidades-chinesas-sobem-em-ranking-por-disciplinas/</link><description>Chinese universities have risen at the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025” in various areas, although in arts and humanities Asia remains short of other continents. In 11 disciplines analyzed, such as Law, Management and Economics, China and Singapore are in the 50 best, while Hong Kong stands out in Education Studies
 
The world's latest ranking ranking for areas of Times Higher Education, the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025”, concludes that universities in the interior of China have risen for top positions, although Asia continues to position itself some places below in the areas of arts and humanities.
In total, 11 academic areas were analyzed. “Arts and Humanities”, “Business and Economics”, “Computer Sciences”, “Education Studies”, “Engineering”, “Law”, “Life Sciences”, “Medicine and Health”, “Physical Sciences”, “ Psychology ”and“ Social Sciences ”.
It is concluded, according to an official note from Times Higher Education (The), that “China and Singapore appear among the 50 best in all 11 subjects”, especially the University of Beijing and Tsinghua University to rise, respectively, to Fourth and sex places in disciplines related to “business and economy”. In fact, “Asia's best performance is registered in the areas of management and economics”, with “its main universities to continue to have difficulty competing worldwide in the field of arts and humanities”. "Concerns about the 'crisis' in humanities seem to be designed to continue this year, but the analysis of The reveals the continuous importance to elite institutions."
Given the analysis of 11 academic areas, the neighboring region of Hong Kong stands out in nine, especially in the area of ​​education, where the University of Beijing and Tsinghua also achieved good results. “The National University of Singapore again occupies the ninth position in Engineering, entering the top 10 of the physical sciences-the first institution in Asia to achieve it-in 10th place,” is also read.
Quoted by the same grade, Simon Marginson, professor at Oxford University, an institution that usually leads rankings worldwide, said Asia's performance in this classification shows “the multipolar world of higher education” existing today, with greater amplification “ of national academic capacity ”.
"In this context, over time, the relative position of Anglosfera countries and Western Europe must decrease, not because its absolute quality is decreasing, but because the field of comparison is more filled with other countries to emerge," stated.
The same responsible also pointed out that “the east and southeastern higher education systems have improved in the last two decades due to the growth in the number of students, increased public funding, more performance orientation and management and management and management selective internationalization policies ”.
One of the areas that highlights a better position of Asian universities is in education studies, having shown “a remarkable force, with three universities in the top 10, with the University of Hong Kong in sixth place, the University of Tsinghua in seventh place and The University of Beijing in eighth place. ” In addition, The Show that the Chinese University of Hong Kong has made “significant progress” from 19th to 11th position. On the other hand, the Taiwan National University of Science and Technology (Taiwan Tech) obtained "the highest score in terms of research quality."
However, global leadership goes to Stanford University, "surpassing the University of California, Berkeley, demonstrating exceptional performance in both teaching and research environment."
China rises in law
Looking at the area of ​​law, there is no ranking of The Ranking, the best place to study than Stanford University, which has achieved “excellence in teaching and research environment”, followed by Harvard University, followed by Harvard, followed by Harvard, With “exceptional performance in research” and thirdly, the University of New York, “with the highest score in terms of research environment”.
Highlight, in this area, for the entrance of the University of Beijing in 14th position, in part due to the good classification “in teaching and the research environment”. It should be noted that, as regards the law, 389 institutions from 48 countries and territories were classified, using 18 “strict performance indicators”.
In the area of ​​law, specialties are analyzed such as constitutional and administrative law and examination to structures and frameworks of governance, or international law, which includes global legal systems and treaties.
Capital Knowledge
China also stands out in business and economy, led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The University of Beijing rose to fourth place, accompanied by 20 other Chinese universities that improved their positions in the table. In this area were analyzed 990 institutions from 85 countries and territories, with the attention focusing on the quality of teaching and research in disciplines such as strategic leadership, international business and organizational development, as well as business finances or economic.
With regard to the social sciences, China actually comes below the list of the top 20, again with the University of Beijing in 16th and the University of Tsinghua in 20th. Here, the lead is up to MIT, passing Stanford University for the third to call Oxford, with "exceptional performance in teaching and research environment." The London School of Economics and Political Science remains an integral institution of the top 10, now occupying ninth place.
1,093 institutions from 100 countries and territories were analyzed in disciplines such as media communication and studies, politics and international studies, including development studies, sociology, geography and anthropology.
China also rose in the discipline of Computer Science with the University of Beijing to move from 16th to 12th place. In this area, leads the University of Oxford, reaching its highest score ever.
MIT Leads in Arts
The MIT has been at the head of Stanford University, taking on the “first place in the arts and humanities, as well as in business, economy and social sciences”, even if it is first recognized “by specialization in the domains of science, technology, engineering and mathematics". According to the ranking, it is now “the best place to study arts - with high scores in each of the five pillars underlying the methodology, especially the quality of the investigation and the international perspective”.
In the 11 disciplines of the ranking, "Stanford ranked first in education, law and psychology studies, Harvard University ranked first in engineering and life sciences."
The only local institution in the ranking of The Disciplines is the University of Macao (one), but in places much below the top 10: in the area of ​​computational sciences, it is in the group of the 126-150 best in the world, a similar position occupied in the area of ​​education and engineering. In the area of ​​law, for example, one is in the best group of 176-200, while in life sciences is among the 151-175 best.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 04:59:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Work | Future Ready Talent Program released in Macau and Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/17/108890/</link><description>Wynn and insurer Aia are two of the 14 companies that are part of the “Future Ready” project, launched by LinkedIn on Thursday in Hong Kong. The program bets on vocational training in the two special administrative regions, with special focus on artificial intelligence
 
The LinkedIn social network, facing the world of work, launched last week in Hong Kong, a talent formation program that has the collaboration of 14 companies from the territory and Macao, namely the Aia insurer and the operator of the game Wynn. The program, titled “LinkedIn Future Ready”, aims to “equip professionals from Hong Kong and Macau with the skills needed to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market,” is referred to in a note of the organization.
The other participating companies or entities are the Cathay Pacific airline, the Chow Tai Fook jewelery group, the PLC group, the English Schools Foundation, the FWD group, Hop Lun, Link Asset Management, Mtr Corporation, a company Hong Kong's meter, and PCCW consultant, without forgetting Prudential, Swire Properties, which operates in the real estate market, and the Hong Kong Jockey Club.
The program includes "initiatives for updating skills, knowledge exchange and [sharing] of data based information." Essentially, “Future Ready” intends to “equip companies with tools and resources needed to navigate a workforce transformation scenario and promote a culture of innovation”.
Given the latest projections of the social network, which published, in January, the report "Work Change Report - Ai Is Coming to Work" [Labor Change Report - Artificial Intelligence (IA) is coming to work], the program “ Future Ready ”intends to make more training available in this area in both territories.
“The 'LinkedIn Future Ready' program is a bold initiative that aims to support the work force in Hong Kong and to Colmar Skills in terms of skills, as well as unlocking new opportunities in growing economy,” said Mei NG, director-general of LinkedIn social network in Hong Kong.
The official also added that the social network will work closely with the 14 participating companies, to build “a more resilient workforce” by providing “companies that develop and implement innovative talent strategies and ensure that their employees are equipped with the skills necessary to succeed in the future. ”
Skills below
According to the same statement, before advancing to this training program, an assessment of markets was made in both territories. It is concluded that “Hong Kong and Macao perform well in cross-cutting skills and innovation-both essential to navigating the dynamic current business landscape”, and by transversal skills, “communication, teamwork and leadership” is understood.
In terms of innovation, another factor analyzed, “Hong Kong exceeds the APAC average [Asia-Pacific countries] in innovation skills, reinforcing its role as a business center with future vision that also promotes transformation in industry” . However, the neighboring region “is behind APAC average in AI proficiency”, so the mentors of the “Future Ready” program consider that there is “an urgent need for competency improvement initiatives to help enable the workforce to work adapt without problems to technological advancement ”.
There is, in this domain, a “growing demand for AI -related skills”, as “77 percent of Hong Kong business leaders said they would hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills rather than a more experienced candidate without these skills” .
In addition, "although transverse skills remain the strongest area of ​​Hong Kong, the region continues to be below APAC average and is late in four of the five domains of critical skills evaluated."
One of the objectives of the program announced on Thursday is to “improve and requalify the labor” of both territories “for a future fueled with AI”, so that there is “a certain combination of technical and human skills”, constituting “A competitive advantage for professionals and organizations”.
The 14 partner companies will have access to more than 23,000 courses available on the “LinkedIn Learning” platform that are based on 41,000 skills sets, namely “curated learning paths, technology training, AI training and digital learning resources from Ponta ”, is explained.
The future accelerates
According to the same report released by LinkedIn in January, AI's growing adoption worldwide will lead to a "search for new jobs and skills." The social network data reveal that “more than 10 percent of hired workers currently have positions that did not exist in 2000, including functions such as data scientist, social networking manager, sustainability manager, customer success manager and AI engineer manager ”.
In the present case of Hong Kong, by 2030, “60 percent of all skills used to do a job will have changed, with the innovations of accelerating this transformation to 80 percent”, is mentioned. Thus, it is concluded that "this rapid pace of change has created a gap of competencies that is difficult to conform in the short term."
In addition to betting on professionals, the “Future Ready” program also wants to promote ideas and debates, promising, for example, “quarterly round tables for executives” and meetings “with sector leaders to discuss the evolution of jobs, skills and requirements of learning ”. “The program will also provide a platform for the sharing of best practices, influencing the widest development of the workforce in all sectors,” is still added.
Also noteworthy is that the LinkedIn report on changes in work structures describe the most usual forms of AI use, namely communication in human resources or marketing. Thus, "recruiters who use LinkedIn's AI -assisted messages to involve candidates are registering an acceptance rate 44 percent higher compared to the AI ​​-free messages." In addition, “marketers who use LinkedIn's ad campaign creation tool, Accelerate, are presenting a cost per 42 percent lower compared to the classic campaigns” of this social network.
For this report were held several inquiries, namely more than 2,500 entrepreneurs from five countries (United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and India). The questionnaire focused on executives from various business areas (human resources, operations or marketing) was made in nine country and had 19,991 participants from companies with over 1000 employees. This inquiry was held from 26 November and December 13 last year.
In worldwide terms, in 2030 about 70 percent of each worker's tools and skills will change, with the “emerging as a catalyst”, and “the investments made in AI [by companies] are starting to start compensate: In the last two years, 51 percent of the business that adopted the Generative AI reported an increase in revenues of 10 percent or more. ” “Unsurprisingly, 88 percent of top executives with top management positions said AI adoption to help accelerate business is something important to develop next year,” one reads.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Corruption | Report Alert for gaps in Hong Kong and Singapore</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/14/corrupcao-relatorio-alerta-para-lacunas-em-hong-kong-e-singapura/</link><description>The 2024 Corruption Perception Index presents Singapore as the third cleaner jurisdiction of corruption worldwide, out of 180 countries and regions. Hong Kong is in 17th place in the ranking, but the report leaves a warning: world financial centers remain vulnerable to corruption
 
This Tuesday was released the perception rate of corruption (CPI, in the English acronym), which analyzes corruption in the public sector of 180 countries and regions, the responsibility of the non-governmental organization international transparency.
In the case of China, the CPI reveals that there was no significant change. If 100 points means a country virtually corruption, and 0 points a highly corrupt country, China registered last year 43 points in 100, rising a position compared to 2023, occupying 76th ranking position.
The CPI also looks at Hong Kong's situation, which got 67 points in 100, occupying 17th position in 180 countries and regions around the world. Taiwan, is currently 25th in the ranking of 180 countries, and no change of positioning compared to the CPI of 2023.
To register the presence of an Asian country on the list of the four less corrupt. This is the case of Singapore, third with 84 points in 100, following Finland (2nd) and Denmark (1st). The list of the top four ends with New Zealand.
According to official CPI data, countries and regions that are considered “full democracies” have an average of 73 points, while those that have political systems in which “faults” have 47 points. According to the index, non-democratic regimes receive only on average 33 points.
The CPI analyzes corruption in 180 countries based on sources such as studies or specialists, measuring corruption only in the public sector. However, limitations are assumed in this count, as the ranking does not include "corruption of private companies, financial secrecy or transnational corruption."
If the score represents “the level of perception of public sector corruption on a scale of 0-100”, the country's position in the ranking is only comparison with other countries, and these lists “may change merely if the number of countries are to alter".
Looking at the global scenario, the report points out that “once again that developed economies dominate the top of the 2024 CPI ranking”, it is countries that “have a long time benefiting from a strong rule of law, the operation of institutions. Government and Political Stability - Factors that contribute to a perception of low corruption levels at internal level ”. However, "these attributes make these countries main targets of corrupt actors for money laundering and protection of illicit gains."
The Money Trail
According to the report, the fact that developed economies dominate the CPI can give a false idea that these countries "are making corruption effectively and remains untouched." “This idea could not be further from the truth. In particular, the nations that constitute large financial centers are more vulnerable to the financial flows of corruption. While their strong institutions convey an idea of ​​integrity, financial sectors and regulatory staff often provide opportunities to explore gaps, reducing anti-corruption global efforts, ”is still described.
In this regard, the examples of Hong Kong and other territories associated with offshore jurisdictions are presented, where it is not always possible to determine the trail of money. “Western financial centers such as Switzerland, Luxembourg, or the United Kingdom have a history of scrutiny of facilitating money laundering movements. However, non -western centers such as Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates progressively have played similar papers and require similar analysis. ”
“Like western counterparts, they boast the existence of a strong rule of law and institutions with a proper functioning, even though bank laws, corporate structures and secret provisions allow cases of funds washing and diversion of regulations, avoiding the Detection ”of less legal cases, is still described.
It refers to the case of the transfer of African funds to financial centers, such as Carlos São Vicente, former CEO of an Angolan state company that transferred about $ 1.2 billion to companies registered in shorts, and later transferred Tronches of money for accounts in Singapore and Switzerland. Only for a Singapore reported account, 558 million US dollars were transferred.
Opacity here
With regard to Hong Kong, it is revealed that by 2023 the territory "fines for four banks in a total of $ 3.2 million, negligent 0.0085 percent of the profits reported by these same banks this year."
Still regarding Raehk, it is revealed that "there is no central registration system on the possession of beneficiaries - it is simply required for companies that maintain this information for themselves." “Some types of investment funds are still exempt from maintaining records from their owners. With over 1.4 million companies registered in 2023, maintaining compliance with monitoring these rules is a huge challenge, creating gaps that actors in the shadow can easily explore, ”he is also described.
It also states that "opacity is even worse with regard to investment funds," with Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates "not having any form of registration of funds beneficiaries." “As a result, even the authorities have no way to know how many funds there are and how they operate in their countries, leaving the active adjacent to these funds alone. In cases where illegalities are suspected, authorities trust the beneficiaries to provide information: a process that consumes a lot of time and is not efficient, ”he adds.
Money and climate
In general terms, the CPI report points out that, in the Asia Pacific region, "leaders have failed to wage corruption in the middle of climbing a climate crisis." In a note signed by Ilham Mohamed, Yuambari Haihuie and Urantsetseg Ulziikhuu, regional advisers of international transparency, consider that “governments throughout the Asia Pacific region continue to fail in anti-corruption promises”, drawing attention to the fact of the region face many natural disasters and be “home of one third of the world population, with the second largest number of young people ”from the world.
“With no concerted efforts to combat corruption now, the first generation that is facing the extreme climate change will face disastrous consequences,” is described.
"Corruption obstructs environmental policies, wages climatic financing and prevents advancement in regulations and policies, making those who have less resources more vulnerable," the report, which points to the fact that corruption wages "the effective use of money, is more vulnerable, points out. ”In the fight against climate change.
Pakistan is mentioned, “which has suffered unprecedented climate vulnerabilities in recent years, with systemic governance failures and barriers in the implementation of policies - including delays in the implementation of regulations and establishment of institutions within the 'Climate Change Act 2017' - have left The context of financing far below the US $ 348 billion projected for the end of 2030 ”.
Also noteworthy is the case of Vietname, which had 32 projects of solar and wind energy under investigation due to “abuse of power”. The report describes "that the lack of civic space for effective inspection, as well as a limited number of mechanisms for effective complaint systems support - such as informators protection - has threatened these fundamental programs."</description><pubDate>2025-02-14 00:11:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Defense | World expense increased by 7.4% in 2024</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/defesa-despesa-mundial-aumentou-74-em-2024/</link><description>The worldwide expense with the defense sector increased by 7.4 percent by 2024, but European countries can be unlikely to maintain their pace due to internal budget pressures, according to a study published yesterday.
According to the Military Balance 2025, produced by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), public expense with defense reached $ 2.46 billion last year, increasing in all regions of the world, except in sub -Saharan Africa.
European investment has grown in particular, especially the 23.2 percent increase in Germany, which would have surpassed the United Kingdom in military spending in second place in NATO, behind the US.
IISS estimates that, as a whole, NATO European members spent $ 442 billion from the defense sector in 2024, less than a third of the total Atlantic alliance expense, which rises to $ 1.44 billion.
“With the persistence of budgetary pressures in most European countries, it is likely that it is difficult to maintain the increase in expenses. The burden is not shared widespread, with some NATO countries spending more than 3 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), while others remain below the base line of 2 percent, ”says Iiss in a statement.
In real terms, the European defense expense has grown 50 percent in nominal terms in the last decade, according to the Military Balance 2025, which every year makes an assessment of military capacities and the world -level defense economy.
The study includes updated data on military structures, equipment inventories and defense budgets from more than 170 countries.
IISS estimates that an increase to 3 percent of GDP of all European NATO members would grow the amount more than $ 250 billion and almost $ 750 billion if the 5 percent value was reached, as it reached Suggest US President Donald Trump.
"However, these values ​​are unattainable at this time, with some countries resorting to extra-organizational instruments to reinforce budgets," the British Studies Center acknowledges. As for the US, although this country spends in defense 3.39 percent of GDP, “limitations are evident in its industrial defense base” due to the need for investment and modernization, he says.
Complicated accounts
The IISS estimates that Russia's military expenses increased 41.9 percent by 2024, overloading the budget for the equivalent of 6.7 percent of GDP, which is higher than the total of the European expense with the defense in terms of parity of the Purchase power.
However, it states that the Russian economy remains resilient thanks to revenues from non -energetic sources, which allow you to maintain a reduced budget deficit and central bank measures.
According to the military balance, it is increasingly difficult to quantify the Russian expense with the defense due to financing by regional entities, private companies and even families, which pay equipment and basic provisions. About China, IISS accounts for internal reorganization and reforms to make the military structure more efficient, namely through the fight against corruption, investigation and increased capacities, namely equipment.
The Chinese budget in 2024 was estimated at about $ 235 billion, an increase of 7 percent compared to 2023 and an amount equivalent to 44 percent of total expenditure in Asia.</description><pubDate>2025-02-13 01:42:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Light Metro | Works on the east line will start</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/metro-ligeiro-obras-na-linha-leste-vao-arrancar/</link><description>The Directorate of Public Works Services (DSOP) announced yesterday that the construction of the entries and exits of two stations in the northern segment of the eastern Metro Line will start “in a short period of time”, so some changes will be made in the circulation of vehicles and people.

The person responsible for the workers' clinic understands that the authorities should combat the popularity of the drug with an awareness campaign directed to the youngest
 
The interception of a woman, coming from Macao, at the Sheung Wan ferry terminal in Hong Kong with an electronic cigarette with ethomidate, the anesthetic drug known as “space oil”, made sound alarms in Macao. The Federation of Macao Workers 'Associations (Faom) yesterday issued a statement on the subject, in which the head of the workers' clinic and a member of the drug fighting committee, Hoi Sun San, called for the criminalization of the drug, like that that happens in Hong Kong and in the interior of China.
Hoi Sun San argues that the case aroused the concern of all sectors of society and served as an alert to the need to regulate emerging drugs in Macao. The guardian expects the government to intensify efforts to combat drug crimes and the education of residents to recognize and remain away from the harmful effects of drugs, especially new types of substances and the legal consequences of trafficking in nurser.
Ethomidate is a hypnotic anesthetic administered in surgeries that has become one of the chemical components used in the execution of a lethal injection death penalty in the US state of Florida.
Train
Lawyer Loi I Man, cited by the same statement from Faom, stressed that ethomyidate was included in the list of psychotropic substances under the control of the interior of China in October 2023, establishing drug criminalization.
In Hong Kong, the law criminalized “space oil” on February 14. Trafficking and manufacture has been punished with a maximum penalty of perpetual imprisonment and a fine of up to 5 million dollars of Hong Kong, while inauguration and consumption are punished with a maximum penalty of seven years in prison and a $ 1 million fine of dollars Hong Kong.
“Space Oil” has gained popularity and became the third most consumed drug in Hong Kong, after cocaine and cannabis, leading John Lee's government to act. The head of the workers' clinic stressed that authorities cannot ignore the damage that new drugs can cause in society, especially among the younger ones that are more susceptible to bad influences. In addition, from a medical point of view, Hoi Sun San said the new drugs, such as “space oil”, are highly addictive, causing not only functional disability but also permanent damage.
However, the member of the drug struggle committee understands that it is necessary to go beyond the legislation, combating the phenomenon through the intensification of preventive education and the sensitization of the population, especially young people.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 05:00:52</pubDate></item><item><title>ATFPM | Lack of political vision makes it difficult to choose higher education</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/atfpm-falta-de-visao-politica-dificulta-escolha-de-cursos-superiores/</link><description>The Association of Macao Public Function Workers (ATFPM) organized on Saturday the seminar “Employment and Future Development of Youth”, which was attended by about 100 people.
The president of the Association, Deputy Pereira Coutinho, stressed that the current uncertainty about the future of Macao and the absence of a perspective view of policies have led to the lack of rational planning in university courses. This situation, according to the official, makes it difficult for young people to understand the real needs of talents of society, and generates "great anxiety among young people about their future."
Given that Macau is a “outside economy”, Coutinho stressed that the territory is impacted with political and economic instability at the global level, favoring only traditional industries.
In this context, Coutinho encouraged young people to follow the “current development of industries and intensify the study of emerging and promising disciplines such as artificial intelligence, big data, mathematics and languages”.
Also the president of the ATFPM General Assembly, Rita Santos, highlighted the deterioration of the employment environment in Macau, noting that “the association receives an average of 50 cases, mostly related to employment concerns, excessive mental stress and planning of career".</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:25:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Consumption | New Round of Grand Prix in March</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/consumo-nova-ronda-de-grande-premio-em-marco/</link><description>The government announced a new round of the Grand Prix of Consumption, the program that distributed discount coupons to stimulate the economy in community neighborhoods. The value of the highest reduction has risen to 200 patacas and the elderly will have a macau pass card with immediate discounts
 
Exactly in a month, on March 24, the “Great Prize for Consumption in Community Zones 2025” begins, which will be extended for 10 weeks until June 1. The new version of the program, budgeted at 295 million patacas, was presented on Saturday, and aims to “boost the local consumer environment, increase confidence in the consumer market and further improve the exploitation of commercial establishments in community zones”. .
The presentation of the new edition of the Discount Program was in charge of the Directorate of Economics and Technological Development Services (DSEDT) and the Macao Commercial Association.
The new round brings some changes compared to the previous ones. For those who use electronic payment platforms, such as MPay and Bank Apps, the program's molds remain, with three weekly discount coupons draws, after a payment of over 50 patacas, to spend on the end -week. However, two news were added. The maximum discount coupon value has risen to 200 patacas, "to stimulate consumption in great value to raise the feelings of consumer obtaining and participation," said DSEDT. The new round will also allow consumers to use multiple discount coupons at a single transaction, increasing "the flexibility of using benefits," and "simplifying the operation of commercial establishments."
EXCLUSION AND INCLUSION
In this program, which starts at the end of March, the number of excluded commercial surfaces increased. Stores and restaurants inside hotels or “integrated resorts” will not accept discount coupons. At the press conference that presented the program, DSEDT Director Yau Yun Wah, summarized the change by referring that “in simple terms, this time, the public cannot use coupons in Cotai”, adding that they cannot be used either in Places like Starworld Hotel or MGM Macau. The objective is to “focus on the application of the program in community neighborhoods”.
The other novelty reflects one of the criticisms made to previous programs: the exclusion of elderly people who do not know how to use online payment platforms.
Therefore, the holders of the “Macau Pass card for the elderly” will be able to participate in the program, with benefits at various levels, such as an “immediate discount for consumption of 300 patacas by loading the card”.
Unlike coupons on online payment platforms, senior card discounts can be used throughout the week, giving immediate 50 percent discounts. In addition, the elderly who use Macau Pass for the great consumption award can also get coupons through the electronic payment platforms.
To participate in the program, the elderly have to use the new version of the Macau Pass card, which can be requested at more than 100 service posts.
The Institute of Social Action, in coordination with various social service institutions and six civil associations, will provide support to the elderly in the first ten days of March to replace the card and inform how the discount plan works.
Regarding the discounts themselves, the elderly benefit from 50 percent, half of the transaction made, with the amount to be deducted in the balance of the Macau Pass card to the elderly. In other words, during the great consumption award, "the elderly can buy goods or services in the total amount of 600 patacas with 300 patacas from their own money." The benefits will not be subject to the maximum daily use limit. The new edition of the plan will once again culminate with a final draw.
Perspective
The Macao Commercial Association (ACM) and the government consider the local economy through a period of growth. During the press conference that presented the new consumption award, ACM president Frederico MA Chi Ngai said Macau is “a city full of prosperity,” as it was evident during the Lunar New Year.
Thus, consumption stimuli aims to “continue this good growth trend”. Also the Director of Economics and Technological Development Services, Yau Yun Wah, said that “as a result of the implementation of short -term measures on the promotion of consumption, the use of Macau support measures launched by the central government and the effect of holidays. Chinese New Year, the local consumer market maintains a positive growth trend. ”
However, "in the face of the most recent evolution of the world economy and the economy of the peripheral regions, there were changes to Macao community consumption scenarios."</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Minimum Wage | Law chan u wants to improve review system</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/salario-minimo-lei-chan-u-quer-melhorar-sistema-de-revisao/</link><description>Deputy Lei Chan U argues that the system of revision of the minimum wage values ​​should be changed, like what happened in Hong Kong.

Among the consequences of the memorandum, highlighting the ban on Macao companies invest in certain US industries
 
The Macao Special Administrative Region (MSA) was classified as a “external opponent” from the United States of America (USA), in the memo “America First: Investment Policy”, signed on Friday by Donald Trump. The new policy resulting in the restriction of investments made in the US by Macao companies in areas such as technological development, energy and agriculture.
Macao's integration, as well as Hong Kong, is due to the fact that they are part of the Popular Republic of China (RPC). In addition to the three Chinese jurisdictions, Trump also defined as external opponents Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Venezuela.
The document revealed on Friday justifies investment restrictions with the need to ensure the “national interest” of the US country: “Investment at all costs is not always of national interest. Certain foreign opponents, including the Popular Republic of China, systematically drive and facilitate investment in US companies and assets to obtain cutting -edge technologies, intellectual property and influence on strategic industries, ”the document accuse. “The Popular Republic of China continues these strategies in various ways, both visible and hidden, and often through partner companies or investment funds in third countries,” is added. At no point in the memorandum, there are specified investments accused of intellectual property theft or obtaining state -of -the -art technology.
The document also states that “economic security is national security” and that as “RPC does not allow US companies to take over their critical infrastructures, the United States should not allow the RPC to take over infra- critical structures of the United States ”.
Obstacles to the economy
Until yesterday, the document and classification of MSAR as an external opponent of the US had not resulted in any kind of reaction from the local executive. However, the Ministry of Commerce warned that the new situation will create various obstacles to international cooperation. "The US decision to publish the memorandum 'America First: Investment Policy' seriously affects normal economic and commercial economic cooperation between Chinese and North American companies," said an unidentified spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, in a published message through the Chinese state agency Xinhua and the People's Diary.
The same source said that new policies seriously affect the business environment for Chinese shades to invest in the United States and are "discriminatory."
According to the basic law, external relationships of MSAR are a matter of the responsibility of the central government. However, MSAR can “maintain and develop, relationships, celebrate and execute agreements with countries and regions or international organizations” in areas such as economy, trade, finance, maritime transport, communications, tourism, culture, science, science, technology and sport ”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:10:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Thank you, Nuno, thank you very much</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/obrigado-nuno-muito-obrigado/</link><description>It's been a week since we lost Nuno. We lost your blue gaze, framed by dark hair, and the sometimes innocent beauty of your convictions. We have lost its good mood, your belief in humanity, law and in a fairer society. We lost the good man, balanced and excellent companion. I personally lost my friend with whom, from 14 to 17 years old, I shared my life almost daily on the Camões High School, on the beaches of Costa da Caparica, in the first parties, in the shy experience of the first loves.
Already at that time Nuno Fernando Correia Neves Pereira was a lover of sport, a passion that accompanied him to the end. And it was the best of us when I played playing basketball or soccer. A predestined, it was said. Then came Full-Contact. I still went to see him, at the Coliseu dos Recreios in Lisbon, to hold a display combat in the first part of a display show of the famous Tarzan Taborda. On the way out, he confessed to me: “After 15 seconds it was already all sweaty. After 30 I was already tired. I can't imagine how difficult this is. ” And it was, but the difficulties didn't make him give up.
However, fate did not want him to completely surrender to the sports passion that inhabited him, perhaps because at 18 he brought him to Macau. Here he graduated in law, here was employed in the civil service as a lawyer, having arrived the head of department, here he taught at university, here fell in love, married and had two children: Nuno and Tatiana. Here I met him again when, years later, I also landed in the city of the name of God.
Regarding the law, Nuno was a burning scholar, connoisseur and defender of the right of Macao and its specificities. It fascinated the identity of this unique legislation, built on Portuguese law and local customs, especially because it understood that local law was an expression of the difference of this land and that difference is a synonym for cultural wealth. In this line he worked, taught and a very rare thing is certain: throughout Macao, from no one I heard a bad word about Nuno, which also does not amazed because he has never heard of his part a bad word about someone. This was Nuno: his criticism was never personal, but about ideas, facts or arguments. That is, as it should be and so scarce today is.
Nuno was not just someone interested in his profession, because he had an old love for literature and the arts. I read a lot and read a little of everything, the right chicken to José Saramago, passing by Jorge Amado and Fernando Pessoa. His interest in painting was also born early. At 16, knowing my devotion to The Doors, he offered me a beautiful portrait of Jim Morrison, painted by him the paint, which I hung in my room. He recently told me that he would now renovate he would devote himself to painting, after all the passion that he had never abandoned him either.
But fate didn't want to do so either, because fate is blind and stupid. How could we classify who stole us so, suddenly and grossly, without a warning, without a note, a threat or a preface?
Yeah, Nuno: You could not leave without giving us a last lesson about our precarity, about the vacuum of our plans to laughable luck, about the need to live our lives today, before the uncertainty of tomorrow.
It was deleted, Nuno, but thanks. You didn't have to have left that suddenly, so unexpectedly, but thank you. And thank you for sharing with me part of your way and for all memories (O my God, how they robbed me this week!) Let me. For all: Thank you, Nuno, thank you very much.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Sam Hou Fai and Wu Sui</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/sam-hou-fai-e-wu-sui/</link><description>Everyone knows who Sam Hou Fai is, but Wu Sui, does anyone know who it is? I believe not only most Portuguese, but also many Chinese have never heard this name. However, in Chinese society, especially in Macao where popular beliefs are preserved, Wu Sui is an important figure because it is an “guardian deity” of the year of the serpent, responsible for supervising the happiness and misfortune of the human world.
Wu Sui was born in China 800 years ago during the Song Dynasty and served as a magistrate in Xuning County. During his mandate, Wu Sui exposed many hidden crimes and the neighboring neighbors often sought their help and advice to solve difficult cases. One year, there was a great drought and Wu Sui prayed in the temple for three days and three nights and ended up raining. To relieve the drought's impact on the people, Wu decreed the tax reduction and the rental of the land, providing help to 48,000 victims of this disaster. At that time, more than 400,000 refugees from other affected areas crossed the river to Xiuning and Wu Sui did all possible to help them. While other cities were immersed in chaos due to incidents of agitation, set fire, and withdrawals motivated by drought, the areas governed by Wu Sui remained peaceful and orderly, without anyone creating any problem. Therefore, it is not without reason that popular tradition elected Wu as the guardian divinity in the year of the serpent.
Due to the current complex and constantly changing international developments, it is believed that 2025 will be a year that happens once in every century and will have to face great challenges. Although crises and opportunities are hand in hand, not all leaders know how to “recognize change”, “respond to change” and “seek change”. Recently, Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao work office and the Hong Kong and Macao affairs office with the Council of State, visited the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Hengqin, the cooperation zone and Technological and scientific innovation of Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong (Hetao Cooperation Zone), Modern Service Industry Zone between Qianhai district in Shenzhen and Hong Kong and the port of Yantian, where he was deeply involved in talks with employees responsible to strengthen cooperation between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau and to promote the best integration of these cities in the Great Guangdong-Macau Bay.
Hong Kong and Macao, in conjunction with Guangzhou and Shenzhen, were once seen as the four engines of the development of the Great Guangdong-Macau Bay. However, due to several factors, Hong Kong is still in the “transition from stability to prosperity” while “1+4” diversification in Macau is, for now, in an embryonic phase. If the Government of the MSAR cannot deal with cautious diversification, it will not be able to produce synergies in the Great Guangdong-Macau Bay, but, on the contrary, the status of Macao will endangered as a potential international financial center and as a center World Tourism and Leisure World. Therefore, director Xia is very concerned about the future development of Hong Kong and Macao.
Since Sam Hou Fai took office as chief executive, it is believed that his habit of “streets” has been changed, becoming more complicated for him to learn about the difficulties that the local population faces every day, related to The lack of employment and the closure of stores due to the breach of consumption. In addition to the fall in property prices, the cost of living is constantly increasing and radio programs are often heard from people asking the social risk value and old age pension to be increased. The beautiful idea of ​​“integration of Macao and Hengqin” cannot improve the current living level of short -term Macao residents. In the next lines of governing governing for the financial year of 2025, I sincerely hope that the government is actually concerned with the issues with which citizens have to deal with daily.
Sam Hou Fai passed from the judge of the last court, the Chief Executive, while Wu Sui moved as a magistrate to be a guardian deity of the popular tradition. However, both were confronted with the challenge of finding solutions to relieve the difficulties that people have to face.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 01:31:21</pubDate></item><item><title>Geogostronomy and the role of Portuguese cuisine in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/20/a-geogastronomia-e-o-papel-da-gastronomia-portuguesa-em-macau/</link><description>“Macau’s Food Culture is a fascinating amalgamation of flavors Brought together by centuries of trade and colonial Rule. The Portuguese influence is particularly evident in dishes that combine local ingredients with techniques and recipes brought from Portugal. ”
Macau’s Culinary Delights: Portuguese and Chinese Fusion
BARKER, Anthony
The intersection between geography and gastronomy, designated by geogostronomy, illustrates the significant influence of the place on culinary practices. Macau's Portuguese cuisine encompasses a unique mixture of culinary traditions, innovative practices and cultural exchanges that evolved from Portuguese influences and local ingredients. At the heart of Macanese cuisine is its historical framing. The gastronomic identity of Macao emerges from historical ties with Portugal, especially from the mid -16th century. The Portuguese presence in Asia began a cultural and culinary exchange that led to the development of unique dishes. This connection has established a platform for the culinary exchange not only between Portuguese and Chinese kitchens, but also with flavors from other regions, such as India and Southeast Asia. Thus, the origins of Macanese cuisine can be attributed to this intercultural integration, shaped by the availability of local ingredients and the migration of peoples.
The introduction of ingredients such as turmeric, chilli and potatoes transformed the local kitchen. Traditional Portuguese recipes were adapted to local tastes and available resources, thus creating a distinct culinary hybrid. During the period of colonization, the Portuguese in Macao established a vibrant commercial port, facilitating trade between Europe and Asia.
This trade brought not only exotic ingredients, but also several culinary techniques that formed the backbone of Macau's cuisine. The mixture of flavors of Portuguese, Chinese and Asian influences contributed to the richness of Macao's culinary supply. Macau's cuisine scene has been shaped by several chefs that have been at the forefront of promoting traditional Portuguese dishes cast with local influences. Its approach exemplifies the culmination of Portuguese culinary traditions and local ingredients, resulting in innovative dishes that appeal to both locations and tourists.
In addition, historians and gastronomic critics have played a crucial role in the documentation and promotion of the history of Portuguese cuisine in Macau. Its investigation provides valuable information on the evolution of culinary practices, helping to preserve heritage and ensure its future relevance. Geogostronomy analyzes the way geographical and cultural contexts shape food practices. In Macao, this perspective is evident in the cooking fusion that defines the region. Several traditional Portuguese dishes have been adapted using local spices, creating a unique version that reflects the identity of Macau and cannot be considered a copy or tampering.
The influence of local spices and culinary techniques also led to the onset of macanese dishes, such as “Pork Chop Bun”, called the “Macanese version of the hamburger” and derived from “Bifana” and “African Chicken”, which is derived from the “Chicken to Piri Piri” that show the mixture of flavors and traditions. The role of spices in Macanese cuisine cannot be underestimated. The Portuguese settlers brought with them a wide variety of spices from their colonies, including black pepper, cinnamon and cloves. These flavors mingled with Chinese indigenous ingredients, giving rise to unique dishes that reflect both inheritances. For example, one of the most famous macanese dishes is Cod to Brás, a cod dish that integrates Portuguese techniques with local flavors such as garlic and onion. Another remarkable dish is the iconic Macaense Caril, which features Portuguese influences infused with spices that resemble Indian cuisine.
The introduction of new cooking methods is an important aspect of this merger. Traditional Portuguese cuisine often involves techniques such as grilling, stewing and baking. These methods have been harmoniously mixed with Chinese methods, such as frying and steaming, creating a kitchen that is as diverse in preparation as in taste. Douts like the “Cabydela Duck”, a plate of duck in vinegar and served with rice, exemplify this mixture. The use of rice itself is noteworthy, as it is a basic food in both cultures, often prepared with techniques that enhance its flavor, such as frying with garlic before boiling.
The adaptation of these dishes demonstrates the dynamic nature of culinary practices in response to geographical and cultural factors. The role of Portuguese cuisine goes beyond mere culinary practices; It plays a significant role in the formation of cultural identity and the economic development of Macao. The region's rich cooking supply has become a vital part of its tourist industry. Tourists looking for authentic experiences are often attracted to local restaurants that serve traditional Luso-Maca dishes, thus supporting companies and the economy.
In addition, the culinary landscape gained international recognition, with Macao receiving the title of UNESCO gastronomy city on October 31, 2017. This designation underlines the importance of preserving culinary heritage, simultaneously promoting its cultural meaning and its innovation potential. Highlights the need for sustainable practices in tourism and gastronomy sectors, ensuring that Macao's unique flavors continue to prosper. In recent years, Macao's culinary scene has recorded significant changes due to Covid-19 pandemic, globalization and the alteration of consumer preferences.

The contents of the new law are simple, but from an operational point of view, there are many issues that deserve to be discussed.
The two main questions are as follows, in the first place, neither infrastructors nor their legal guardians are not penalized in the light of the new law, the penalty is only about companies that generate social networks. This approach can lead to disputes on the attribution of responsibility when put into practice.
Secondly, the new law requires companies that generate social networks to take measures to verify the age of users. However, the new law clearly stipulates that users cannot carry in these platforms the identification documents, which makes the correct determination of their age difficult. A goal spokesman stated that Facebook respects Australian law, but is concerned about the process adopted, as it considers that the law was accelerated to ensure the interdiction of children's access to social networks without being heard to different opinions on the subject.
Since currently there is no more effective method to prevent children from using social networks, to solve the problem, the Australian government has stated that it would adopt the “age certification system”. It is planned to invite 1,200 Australian citizens to take an age evaluation test, and a consulting firm will implement recommendations in the middle of this year. This will be one of the largest tests with age assessment technology ever performed. If successful, it will become an important reference indicator for legislative agencies and technological platforms around the world to detect the age of users of social networks. It will be a highly representative global model and will be congratulated.
But if it fails, will Australia have an alternative plan to enforce the new law? Although not mentioned in the news, from the point of view of public administration, it would be complicated to have a completely new computer system of unknown effectiveness to deal with the social problems arising from the access of children under 16 to social networks, the which is undoubtedly a risk. If prepared for both scenarios Australia will be easier to implement the new law.
When it is necessary to verify the age of the users, the most effective method is through the presentation of identity cards, passports, etc. In Australia this method is not legal, possibly because photos and identification data are personal information and involve privacy protection issues. When companies that generate social networks receive accurate information, they can correctly determine the age of users, but at the same time, as they have access to many data from users, they have to treat them carefully. In light of the new law, companies that generate social networks can avoid these problems because they will not have to process the personal data of users, and they do not need to worry about the possibility of their data being disclosed, stolen or sold by third parties .
Moreover, in relation to the practical and operational aspects of the new law, there is another issue that is concerned with online game. The children under 16 are students of basic education. Young people in this age group have no self-control and self-preservation capacity yet and easily addicted to the online universe. They are very dependent on social networking platforms and online games. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that excessive use of social networks is a risk to the physical and mental health of children and that legislation should be introduced to control this risk. If Australia has passed legislation to protect the physical and mental health of children under 16, is the next step prevent them from playing online?
On October 25, 2019, the management of the Press and Publications of Continental China issued the “National Press Administration Warning and Publications for Prevention of Addiction in Online Games among the Minors”, stipulating that all online game companies can only Have games available on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. These days, the games are available for one hour from 20.00 to 21.00, and no service will be available at other times. This regulation was actually applied in mainland China.
On the other hand, South Korea passed a law in 2011 to restrict access from under 16 to online play between 22.30 and 6.00, but the law was very contested and was eventually repealed because it did not respect the rights of younger people .
The new Australian law recognizes the risks that social networks pose for children's physical and mental health. If young people start using social networks too early, they are subject to adverse consequences such as depression, harassment, anxiety and weak academic results. If you continue to evolve into “internet addiction”, it will be even more serious and inevitable to legislate. The question of restricting children's access to online games can be seen as continuing the restriction of children's access to social networks and can be treated in the same way. The experience of mainland China in this area may be valuable to other countries.
Hong Kong and Macao currently have no legislation that regulates access from under 16 to social networks or online game platforms. Do we need legislation to regulate these issues? The new Australian law is a warning to remind us of this problem. What should we do? Each of these regions can conduct an in -depth investigation and decide according to their conclusions.
Next week we will have a new theme.

The Vila da Taipa Cultural Association presents, from this Wednesday, a new exhibition. This is “Show-off 3.0”, which as the name implies is the third edition of a show of local collectors, that is, what is presented to the public are works of art from Macao personalities or residing in the territory, instead of exposing themselves the work of an artist.
Thus, “Show-off 3.0” has pieces acquired by Lúcia Lemos, founder of the Creative Macau Gallery; Carlos Morais José, director of HM and author; and Rita Machado, architect. This project is born after verifying a “cultural influence brought to the community by the first exhibition of the series”.
According to a statement from the organization, this trio of personalities "shares the impressive collections that have accumulated over the years, both local and international, including works of art that adorn the most intimate spaces of their homes."

The organization of this exhibition considers that collecting art also enhances trade itself in this segment, besides “fostering local and international talent”, and in “Show-off 3.0”, as in the other editions, “aspects of collector's personality ”.
Frames so I want you
Lúcia Lemos, who for years has been at the head of Creative Macau, presents “a collection composed mainly by vibrant and colorful paintings of local and foreign artists”. “Lúcia Lemos has been involved in promoting local artists for over two decades, through the interpretation of various means, including painting, graphic design, 3D art, photography and cinema. She is also a director of the International Short Festival Shortages Sound &amp; Image Challenge since 2010. Being a plastic artist herself, who has developed her abilities in black and white photography and video, her special relationship with the images results from the many years of Exhibition to the artistic environment of the Portuguese city of Porto ”, highlights the organization.
Following is Carlos Morais José, a degree in Anthropology, but always dedicated himself to journalism, being director of HM for several years. In addition, he founded several publishers, namely Cod and Books do Meio, and the latest literary editing project is the editor “Grão-Fala”, based in Lisbon, with the focus of editing works on Chinese and Asian culture in Portuguese. He is also a poet and author.
“Carlos Morais José's collection refers to a subtle and complex relationship between a scholar and a gongshi who sees stones- rocks with a particular aesthetic beauty- which at the unlawful look appear to be just decorative stones but that lead the sneelful If on issues that transcend your appearance, ”he is described.
Rita Machado, architect linked to the Atelier Impromptu Projects, presents works of art that are based on "in relationships she has maintained with many local and international artists, and with some of which has established lasting friendships."
Rita Machado “is interested in the intersections between Western and Eastern culture, urban design and architectural design”, having graduated in architecture at the University of Porto with the thesis “Macau, City (In) Finite”.
João Ó, architect and president of the Vila da Taipa Cultural Association, described to be “an honor to invite three art collectors to show their various art collections in Vila da Taipa, after the success of our experimental exhibitions in the last two years”.
"This rare and special exposure aims to explore the nature of collecting and raise visually stimulating conversations about the cultural possessions of individuals with very specific and highly personal interests," he said. The show can be seen until April 30, intending to “further reinforce the position of Taipa village as one of Macau's main cultural and artistic destinations, underlining its invaluable contribution to the promotion of cultural and creative industries in the territory” .</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 05:31:08</pubDate></item><item><title>We are! | Timor-Leste and Brazil win short stories and illustration</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/somos-timor-leste-e-brasil-vencem-concurso-de-contos-e-ilustracao/</link><description>The winners of the Children's Iajuvenile contest promoted by Somos - ACLP (Portuguese Language Communication Association) are already known.

"The argument was so good, not even needed prior preparation," said the actor, at a press conference of the series in which Lusa participated. “The dialogue was excellent. It might have been pier, pretentious or biased, but in this case I wouldn't be here. ”
“Day Zero” was filmed over seven months in New York, with Robert de Niro being critical to this location. "For some time I had spoken to my agent about doing anything in New York," said the actor, who is also a six -episode miniseries producer.
The cast includes Angela Bassett, Matthew Modine, Jesse Plemons, Lizzy Caplan, Connie Britton and Joan Allen.
Created by Eric Newman (“Griselda”, “Narcos: Mexico”), Noah Oppenheim (former president of NBC News) and Michael Schmidt (journalist), the miniseries departs from a massive cyberataque that turns off in the United States for a minute and causes chaos and thousands of dead.
Robert De Niro plays former President George Mullen, called by current President Evelyn Mitchell (Angela Bassett) to preside over a committee to which unheard of investigation powers are given. The director Lesli Linka Glatter ("West Wing", "Homeland") described the series as "a paranoic conspiracy thriller."
"The idea came from conversations about our relationship with the truth," said Eric Newman at the conference. "It's something global: we have entered a post-truth age where truths can be mutually exclusive."  One of Mullen's antagonists is the author of a podcast, Evan Green (Dan Stevens) who plays with suspicions and throws accusations without proof to monetize the hearing's ultrasound.
"Green represents the bangs that operates around a story like this," said the actor. "He is annoying, a divisive figure who thrives with division and makes it his coin." But the argument does not take a position and none of the interveners comes out particularly well, with a varied range of doubtful decisions, except for former President Sheila Mullen's wife, who maintains integrity.
"What we hope that people will take this is that, although the mechanisms by which we determine the truth can be broken, perhaps irreparably, it is still possible to do the right thing," said Newman. "Although it is a disconcerting view of humanity, in the end there is a certain optimism and hope."
Cocriador Noah Oppenheim said the team started working in this story several years ago and that it is amazing to see how what has happened in the real world mirrors the chaos that the series portrays. "If we think about the threats we face, be it cybership, climate change or nuclear war, the largest of all is the inability to agree with a shared set of facts," he said.
Angela Bassett, who plays President Mitchell, stressed the importance of “seeing this representation of a woman” as the actress “in a place of power in the oval room”, something that excited her to do the series, besides being the second time to work with de niro.
Also Connie Britton, who gives body to Valerie Whitesell, found the humanization of highly political situations interesting, which often forget that behind power positions are human beings with complex relationships and personalities. "This shows us how our choices can have an impact on everyone," he said while the characters try to maintain decorum and respect the high positions.
"These acts of equilibrium are what we do in real life, even if we are not in high risk espionage or cybership," he continued. "We are all trying to find a balance between our responsibilities and intimate relationships."</description><pubDate>2025-02-20 19:00:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Mud | Fire in the lake building causes two injured</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/taipa-incendio-no-edificio-do-lago-causa-dois-feridos/</link><description>In addition to two hospitalized women, 18 people needed help to be removed from the building, although without injury. The fight against the flames was hampered by the wind, since several doors were open
 
Two women were transported yesterday to the Conde São Januário Hospital Center, following a fire in the Lake Building in Taipa. The case happened early in the morning, and in the afternoon, according to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, the authorities suspected that the flames had originated in a short circuit of a television.
The Fire Department (CB) was alerted to the emergency, around 7:46 am, at a time when images of fire circulated online in various social networking groups. According to CB's second commander, Lam Chon Sang initially, the authorities were warned for a 10th floor fire. However, on site, emergency response operations eventually took longer than expected, because the firefighters had to look for the flames, which were active on the 7th floor and not 10, as initially warned.
According to Lam Chon Sang's statements, cited by the newspaper or Mun, rescue operations were also difficult for the damage caused in the service elevator, usually used by firefighters in case of fire, which forced the material to combat Flames was transported by the stairs.
When they reached the firewalk in the corridor, the firefighters came across two inanimate women. The wounds, one 79 and another 51, were removed from the scene, transported to the hospital and were yesterday in serious condition. The two lived in the most affected housing by the flames.
In addition to hospitalized women, rescue operations implied the removal of 18 other residents, who needed help to abandon the building. These people were on three other floors of the building, which were not directly affected by the flames, and none needed to receive medical treatments.
Intense heat
About the fight against the flames, Lam Chon Sang explained that the firefighters found a large fire inside the apartment where the fire has been suspected of having originated. As a consequence, the intense heat sense by the “peacekeepers” forced the extra efforts and more time than it would be expected.
In addition, the fact that several doors in the building are open, contrary to what is normally advised, will have contributed to the flames to spread faster thanks to the wind. The second-commander of the CB also indicated as another of the main difficulties in fighting the fire the delay of about 15 minutes to connect the hoses to water supply.
The flames were declared extinct around 08h55, but the aftermath phase lasted until 09h40. The apartment where everything will have started was very damaged, and there were two more dwellings, with smaller losses.
In total 54 firefighters were mobilized for the fire, distributed by 12 emergency response vehicle.
According to the Chinese channel of TDM, several residents of the Lake building complained that the fire alarm did not touch. On this aspect, the Fire Department has hypothesized that the sound was weak in some places further from the flames, since when they reached the building the alarm was playing.
Accompanied the case
Hours after the fire, the Institute of Social Action (IAS) issued a statement to indicate to be very attentive to the developments and referring to having asked traditional associations to engage in support operations. “The Institute of Social Action is very attentive to the fire that took place in the Lake Building, in Taipa. After becoming aware of the event, they were immediately sent to the social workers, accompanied by workers from various social work institutions at the Taipa, including the Community Center of the General Union of Macao Associations, the Taipa Lake Services Center of the Federation of Macao Workers' Associations and the Alegria Family Support Center in abundance of the General Association of Macao Women, with the aim of providing emotional support, advice and other necessary supports according to the needs of residents, ”was reported.
According to the same source, despite the destruction in three dwellings, in the afternoon there were no residents needing “temporary accommodation” provided by IAS.

Associations in the Lake Building
Minutes after the fire images began to circulate online, some of the traditional associations emerged on site to help people affected by the incident. Association employees, such as residents or women, also published on social networks photographs of the site and disclosed telephone contacts for those in need of assistance.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 05:18:42</pubDate></item><item><title>Taxis | Number of offenses tripled in January</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/taxis-numero-de-infraccoes-triplicou-em-janeiro/</link><description>The latest data from the Public Security Police body have a reduction in road mortality, with the occurrence of zero cases in January, unlike taxi drivers who tripled against January 2024 numbers.

Harry Lai recalled that in 2023, shortly after the end of the pandemic, the sector was still with many projects in hand, some of them at the beginning.
However, this year the scenario seems to be different, as construction companies believe there will be fewer projects in the second half of the year due to the fact that there were few public tenders, including few private projects, so this year there will be a few works in this year course. Harry Lai explained that, for example, most of the works in the area of ​​public housing are carried out by companies with capitals from mainland China, with little space for local companies.</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:38:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Economy | Takeaway meals accelerate inflation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/economia-refeicoes-de-takeaway-aceleram-inflacao/</link><description>Inflation accelerated in January for the first time in the last six months, according to official data. The increase in Takeaway meals prices was primarily responsible for the climb
 
Inflation accelerated in January, for the first time in half a year, especially due to the cost of meals acquired away from home, in a month that featured the start of the Lunar New Year, was announced on Friday.
The Consumer Price Index (IPC) rose 0.57 percent in January, in annual terms, and increased 0.17 percent compared to December, according to official data released by the Directorate of Statistics and Census Services (DSEC ).
January thus ended a period of five consecutive months of deceleration of inflation. In December, the IPC had increased 0.23 percent in annual terms and retreated 0.01 percent compared to November.
December was the month when Macau was closer to falling into deflation (annual fall in consumer prices) since June 2021, when the city lived the last 10 consecutive months of deflation in the peak of the economic crisis caused by the pandemic.
Deflation reflects weakness in domestic consumption and investment and is particularly severe, as a drop in the price of assets, as a rule contracted with credit, generates an imbalance between the value of loans and bank guarantees.
Everything avoided
In a statement, DSEC justified the acceleration in January with a 0.88 percent rise in the sector of food products and non -alcoholic beverages.
The Lunar New Year, the largest mass movement in the world, is the main traditional party of Chinese families and takes place in January or February, depending on the lunar calendar. This year, he celebrated between January 28 and February 4.
The cost of meals acquired outside the home rose 1.7 percent. With the progressive recovery of tourism, Macau registered a 10.1 percent increase in the price of airplane tickets and a 17.4 percent growth in the cost of tours and hotel rooms abroad.
With the increase in the number of visitors, the region recorded a 23.1 percent increase in the price of jewelry, watches and products made of gold. Apartments mortgages have risen 0.36 percent, although the housing price index fell 11.7 percent last year and Macau's monetary authority approved three interest rates in the last three months 2024.
The Legislative Assembly approved, on 18 April, the end of several taxes on the acquisition of housing, to “increase liquidity” in the real estate market, defended the secretary for the economy and finance, Law Wai Nong. Official data also show that health services were 1.1 percent more expensive and the cost of insurance rose 2.47 percent.</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:34:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us around the house, pies us his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on violations in Ukraine in this “special operation”), an act that he forced us to watch, and then we tell him: High There we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You haven't said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - Madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is managed to seek a reason for Things abroad to us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicidou -If and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ that had not entered the story. »
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when you announced the Nobel Prize in this year's literature, I couldn't help but remember this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, compared to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large newspaper Daily National Wrote wrote Five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize of Literature was awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete unknown. But unknown to whom? How did not happen to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners - I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example - but that only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone is He knows and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from him.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I also preferred that in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have been awarded. Les années ”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise the reading of a beautiful interview book with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday an article came out in Maputo's morning “News”, to realize that the Pen Club narrative prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho Award Coast.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification as to their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timothy should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but to be highlighted simply that we "we do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funeral trips for countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - which starts still awaits us, that secret spells we will still have to overcome, what horrors will be erected before our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.

«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the midst of Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneousness and frankness were coarcet in relationships in relations human, or if it only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a "essence", declared in the presumption of each be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as António Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter My Dear Friend: You are a pure, excellent and very noble poet, but one Also victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I malice.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people, who always seems the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters At eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Evidently, they are the two 'Bigger Than Life', but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my rank of hatter at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and Treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

According to a statement widespread by the company through its News Portal Alizila, the announced amount exceeds the combined investment of the last decade in these two fields, identified by the group as strategic, along with the traditional electronic trade business.
When presenting the results of the third fiscal quarter, on Friday, the group's CEO Eddie Wu revealed that the company intended to make “greater investment” in areas such as AI and cloud data services, although not had specified amounts.
According to Alibaba, the measure "reinforces its commitment to long -term technological innovation" and "underlines the company's bet on AI -driven growth and its role as a leading [data services in] cloud."
At the conference with analysts who followed the presentation of the results, Wu stated that AI is a “unique opportunity in a generation” and noted that achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI, a type of AI that would equal human intelligence) will be the main objective in the long run of the company.
In his opinion, AI's ability to replicate human labor, both intellectual and physical, “could remodel” industries worldwide, leading “significant transformations” in economy and technology.
The CEO recalled that a growing part of the AI-generated data will be processed and distributed through cloud networks, positioning Alibaba AI subsidiary, Alibaba Cloud, as "a key infrastructure supplier."
Artificial future
During the third tax quarter, the adjusted revenue from the cloud intelligence subsidiary increased by 11 percent over the previous year, while IMA revenue related to AI experienced its sixth consecutive three -digit growth quarter.
In recent weeks, Alibaba has announced a pact to incorporate its QWEN model into Apple's iPhones in China, and there has been speculation that it may be interested in becoming investor at Deepseek, the AI ​​Chinese platform that shook the sector.
“Looking to the future, the growth of revenues in the cloud intelligence division will continue to accelerate, driven by AI,” explained Wu, last Friday, in a message that accompanied the disclosure of the company's results, sent to the Bolsa de Hong Kong values, which exceeded analysts expectations.
In the last quarter, Alibaba increased the volume of 8 percent and profits at 239 percent, in homologous terms.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 05:24:45</pubDate></item><item><title>CCP removes former aerospace company president by corruption</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/pcc-afasta-antigo-presidente-de-empresa-aeroespacial-por-corrupcao/</link><description>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) expelled Tan Ruisong, former president of state -owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), following the expansion of the ongoing anti -corruption campaign in the country to aerospace and military sectors.
The Central Inspection and Disciplinary Commission (CCDI), the CCP's maximum anti -corruption body, said Tan “took sides with the military sector for his personal benefit” and has transformed his position into an instrument of illicit enrichment.
The agency accused the former employee of accepting bribes and using his position to influence business restructuring and project contracts.
The investigation revealed that the former president “lost his ideals and convictions, betrayed his original aspirations” and violated the CCP's internal regulations by “accepting inappropriate banquets”, “involving power exchanges for sex” and when using their position to “seek benefits for third parties in the restructuring of companies and hiring engineering projects”.
Tan, who was secretary of the Communist Party at AVIC, is also accused of covering information on official investigations, giving illegally present and diverting large sums of public funds.
Redoubled efforts
Following its expulsion of the CCP, the case was sent to the judicial authorities, which may lead to a criminal proceedings.
The announcement is part of the vast anti -corruption campaign launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping, after ascending to power in 2012, in which the senior employees were categorized as 'tigers' and bass status as 'flies'. The campaign has intensified in recent years, with almost 900,000 employees punished in 2024.
The military sector became one of the investigators' leading focuses: CCP's leadership announced in December that it would “redouble their efforts” in a fight that resulted in the fall of army ministers and officers over the past year.
XI stressed the need to reinforce discipline and fight corruption within the Popular Liberation Army (ELP), to ensure that the Armed Forces are "absolutely loyal, absolutely pure and absolutely reliable."
The current campaign aims at civil servants, but also sectors as diverse as finances, tobacco and pharmacist products, among others, and follows to the launched in 2012, which was accompanied by greater repression, censorship and suspicions that the accusations make part of a maneuver to silence critics.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 05:23:07</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | Xi tells Putin that he is "happy to see efforts" to end the war</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/ucrania-xi-diz-a-putin-que-esta-feliz-por-ver-esforcos-para-por-fim-a-guerra/</link><description>When three years of the beginning of the Ukraine invasion of Russia are marked, the Chinese administration reaffirms its commitment to the struggle to find a solution to the conflict. The Chinese president welcomed the new efforts to the US and Russia
 
Chinese President Xi Jinping told Russian homologist Vladimir Putin yesterday, who is happy to see that Russia and other countries are making "positive efforts" to end the war in Ukraine.
"China is pleased to see that Russia and relevant parts are making positive efforts to end this crisis," Xi said in a telephone conversation, which takes place on the third anniversary of the Ukraine war.
Quoted by the Official News Agency Xinhua, Xi also said that the ties between China and Russia have a “strong internal driving force” and a “unique strategic value”, and that the two countries are “two good neighbors” and “true friends ”, Which support each other in search of a“ common development ”.
The Chinese leader added that the bilateral relationship “is not directed against third parties, nor will it be influenced by anyone”, stressing that ties will continue to develop “easily” and “will help mutual development, injecting stability and positive energy in international relations ”.
According to Xinhua, Putin said he is committed to "eliminating the deep causes of conflict" between Russia and Ukraine in order to "achieve a sustainable and lasting peace solution."
On the side of peace
China said yesterday that it has always been “on the side of peace” and will continue to work to “build a consensus” that end the war in Ukraine, which has been going on for three years.
"Since the beginning of this crisis, we have been working and maintaining communication with the parties involved, with the aim of building a consensus for peace," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian, in conference of the press.
The spokesman added that China has always been "on the side of peace" and maintained a "just and objective" position, which has been "clear and consistent from the beginning."
According to Chinese spokesmen, the Asian country hopes to “maintain communication with all parties involved” and will continue to “effort” to play “a constructive role” in resolving the conflict.
Central position
In recent weeks, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said China's position on conflict has been “rational” and that Beijing wants to “establish a balanced, effective and sustainable security framework for Europe, aiming at a peace lasting ”. "China wants to work with all parties, including Europe," said Wang.
Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, China has maintained an ambiguous position on conflict, appealing to respect for the “territorial integrity of all countries”, including Ukraine, and attention by “legitimate concerns of all countries” reference to Russia.
Beijing was opposed to "unilateral" sanctions against Moscow and called on "decancing and a political solution." However, the West accused China of supporting Russia's military campaign, something the Asian country has always denied.
China has sent diplomatic representatives to the region and presented peace initiatives, such as the plan it elaborated with Brazil last year, which did not include the removal of Russian troops and was rejected by Kiev.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 05:20:48</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau and Angola will sign agreement to combat money laundering</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/macau-e-angola-vao-assinar-acordo-para-combater-lavagem-de-dinheiro/</link><description>Macao and Angola will sign an agreement to exchange information from forming money laundering and terrorism financing, the government announced yesterday.

The three Chinese war ships involved in the operation “performed exercises in international waters, away from the Australian coast,” reads a statement published on the Chinese Weibo social network by the spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Defense Wu Qian.
“During this period, China organized royal fire exercises with war ships, having issued repeated security notices in advance. China's actions fully respected international law and common international practice without affecting the safety of air navigation, ”he said.
The statements of the Australian government, which criticized the lack of transparency of the Chinese army in relation to the exercises "do not correspond to all the facts," he said. “Australia, fully aware of these facts, made unfounded accusations against China and intentionally exaggerated the situation. We are deeply shocked and extremely dissatisfied, ”said Wu.
The spokesman asked Camberra to address bilateral and military relations “with an objective and rational attitude, showing more sincerity and professionalism, and taking concrete measures to promote the stable development of relations between the two countries and armies”.

Australia's defense force accused Beijing Friday of being exercises with real fire without prior notice at the Tasmania Sea, between Australia and New Zealand, forcing the diversion of airlines.

Launched more than a decade ago by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the campaign reached a record number of 889,000 regime staff, according to data released by the Central Inspection and Disciplinary Commission - Maximum Anti -Corruption Organ of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This number represents an increase of almost 50 percent compared to the annual average of about 600,000 between 2018 and 2023.
The 'Think Tank' Gavekal Dragonomics has predicted that the number will continue to grow, highlighting the widening of scrutiny to new sectors, such as finance, energy, health and infrastructure, as well as for lower levels of public administration, including CCP employees in villages, beyond provincial and municipal levels. "Focus on more sectors and more employees will result in more cases - a trend that seems to continue," he says.
To last
The anti -corruption campaign was launched in 2012 and is now considered the most persistent and broad in the history of Communist China.
One of the first targets was former head of security Zhou Yongkang, who once told the courts, police and information services, and was eventually punished with life imprisonment, becoming the highest leader of China convicted of corruption since Foundation of the Popular Republic, in 1949.
From the list is also part of Bo Xilai, the rising star of Chinese politics that fell in disgrace, in a case that involved the murder of a British lawyer. High Army Patents - Last year alone two defense ministers were placed under investigation - and hundreds of ministerial or higher levels were also expelled from the CCP and punished with life prison or death penalty.
Last January, Xi warned that "corruption continues to increase" and is the "greatest threat" for the regime. "The anti -corruption campaign is the only way to break the cycles of governance and chaos, prosperity and decline," he said. Gavekal Dragonomics warned for the purposes of paralysis on Chinese bureaucracy as employees avoid making decisions that can expose them to scrutiny.
XI has alluded to this problem, complaining of 'formalism' and 'bureaucratism' in the government. Documents from the PCC PERMANENT COMMITTEE, the power summit in China now mention the “three distinctions” to reassure employees that they will not be punished for honest errors, aiming to “encourage them to adopt a pioneering stance and demonstrate initiative at work".
Fears and incentives
This comes at a time when Beijing encloses a strategic plan to master emerging technologies, aiming to overtake the United States in the race for technological supremacy.
“State -supported investment funds are reluctant to invest in high -risk technological companies. If employees who generate state funds are more concerned that financial losses invite scrutiny, they will become even more conservative in their investment decisions, ”said the reflection group.
Beijing adopted in 2024 a package of measures to support the real estate sector, plunged into a prolonged crisis. One of the measures aims to encourage local authorities to buy unqualified housing units to promoters. "The risk is that local employees use this tool in moderation to avoid further scrutiny," noted Gavekal Dragonomics.
“It is possible that by giving political priority to the stabilization of growth, the central government has given operational level employees the incentive they need to act. But it is also possible that the fear [of being punished] overcomes all other factors and that local employees cannot once again support the economy, ”he added.</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:45:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Interview | Shan Hai Jing, a museum and the appetite of the old</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/entrevista-escrever-uma-nova-versao-da-historia-mundial-parte-ii/</link><description>An interview with the duo of authors of the next English language publication Shan Hai Jing Code 《上古文明密码》, which today Macau has already presented, but now becomes a museum. Michael Du &amp; Julie Oyang, the authors are currently organizing a breathless textual race through the most important piece of Chinese literature and the heaviest treasure of Chinese culture and… beyond. Julie Oyang is an art and culture critique based on Europe, commentator of Chinese culture and visual philosopher. He is a guest professor at the University of São José in Macau, China. Michael Du is a knowledgeable of the Ancient Chinese Canadian culture, holding the largest collection of Hongshan civilization in the world. He is the founder of Haikou Kiwen International Art &amp; Culture Co. Ltd. (海口啓運國際文化藝術品有限公司) and Kiwen International Cultural Exchange (Yantai) Co.ltd (国际文化交流（烟台）有限公司). Both authors are closely involved in the operation of the China Museum of Art for Pre-Dinastic Civilizations (华夏上古文明艺术馆), which will soon open in Yantai, China.
Q: In part I of the interview, we talked about the historical meaning of the former Chinese manuscript Shan Hai Jing 《山海经》, also known as the Book of Mountains and Seas, especially its universality. What follows?
Michael: We have talked about how a deeper study of Shan Hai Jing can help us understand the origin of the first human civilizations on Earth. But we are makers. We are not for the written pages: we want to ensure that Shan Hai Jing is relevant and alive and making it part of the current culture. With this objective, I found a new company. The Kiwen International Cultural Exchange (Yantai) Co.ltd (启运国际文化交流（烟台）有限公司) was created after the Haikou Kiwen International Art &amp; Culture Co. Ltd. (海口啓運國際文化藝術品有限公司) is the place Where global investigation will take place and the global exchange of knowledge will be encouraged and stimulated in the form of international delegations and high -level visitors. We know so little about the old ones, there are so many questions to ask…
Julie: In fact, there is so much to do. There is so much we can do. In collaboration with the Chinese government, we are both involved in the operation of the China Art Museum for pre-Dinastic civilizations (华夏上古文明艺术馆), where Michael curates his own artifact collection, as well as private collections of Rename around the world, including all pre-doneastic civilizations, such as Hongshan, Liangzhu, Shanxingdui, HongShuihe, Shijiahe, etc. These art objects have never been exposed and were never explained by traditional historians. We understand that it is extremely important for us to provide private collectors a place where they can show their journey dedicated to seeking answers to questions about humanity. In this sense, the China Museum of Art for Pre-Dinastic Civilizations (华夏上古文明艺术馆), which should open in Yantai in April, is a unique and brilliant view. We even have the architecture to correspond to this vision. Our goal is to educate the global public in general, as well as establish a connection with the young audience in a fun way and with high quality standards.
Beyond the exhibition, which will do more to make the mysterious old “alive and active” to the global audience?
Julie: At this time, Michael and I are planning a parallel exhibition and a workshop in collaboration with French artist chef Gil Gonzalez-Foerster (Chinese name: 晓松). In a way, the Yantai museum is a time capsule where an old and faded memory is stored. And Gil's kitchen deals with memory, this time from these pre-Dinastic civilizations, starting from Shan Hai Jing. Being the imaginative guardian of memory, the Chinese classic contains the oldest memory in China, or even in the world. Shan Hai Jing records ancient memories in the form of mythology meditations and the most interesting facts about flora and fauna known for their magical power and powerful force that live from one extreme to the other. This seems to be the reputation of this ancient and inexhaustible text. But Shan Hai Jing is also an extraordinary recipe book!
But why food?
Michael: You are what you eat. Food is an essential part of everyday human life that can tell us more about the past. When a dish is no longer remembered, part of us cease to exist. Food is perhaps the most intimate and sensual memory. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why Shan Hai Jing was written: remember through food? Our curated exhibition will become more complete, more 3D, more realistic, exploring the taste of the ancients!
Julie: Shan Hai Jing documents diverse gastronomic experiences, mixing natural history and food knowledge. His humanist approach makes Shan Hai Jing unique in his genre. The word Shi (食), “eat”, appears more than 160 times in the book, of the ancients. There are, however, many cases about exotic food that heals medical conditions quite familiar to modern men, but Shan Hai Jing also offers cure for conditions such as arrogance, confusion/lack of wisdom, ward off physical dangers. This is a unique culinary philosophy! Food involves the mind, not just the taste. To provoke the intellect. This deep idea is still deeply rooted in modern Chinese food. Through our exhibition, we also understand why Confucius taught his disciples that food is a virtuous gift and why the great Chinese scholarly poets were famous food lovers.
We currently do not know who was the author of the mysterious Chinese classic whose imagination exceeds a thousand and one nights…
Michael: The ancients were "men of appetite." Appetite can explain humanity's historical and economic landscapes more clearly than academic jargon.
Speaking of economics, how is the museum economy managed?
Michael: The museum is an educational organism. It is also a business. We focused on five volumes of business. The investigation mainly involves cooperation with various institutions and training programs in China. We organize courses, events and publications. This part will generate 7.6 million RMB/year. Ticket sales will generate 7.2 million RMB/year. Authenticity certification will generate 3.5 million RMB/year. We will also form art and antique auctions agents, whose program will generate 4.9 million RMB/year. In spring and fall, a large-scale auction will be held, with a conservative estimate of 50 million RMB volume by auction. This amount does not include revenues from the commission of 15% of sellers and buyers. In addition, four more themed auction games will be held annually, with a conservative estimate of 5 million RMB of turnover and 6 million RMB of auctioning commission.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>António Queirós, philosopher and academic: “the West there is great ignorance” about China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/antonio-queiros-filosofo-e-academico-a-ocidente-ha-uma-grande-ignorancia-sobre-a-china/</link><description>Doctorate in Philosophy of Sciences, Environmental and Environmental Ethics, António Queirós, linked to the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon, regrets that the West continues to face China in the wrong way, especially in environmental issues.

Will talk about the theme “The Environmental Crisis and the China Eco-Civilization Project”. What project is this?
This is China's great project for the New Age. It is a concept that began to be elaborated from 2013. This idea began to be realized with different projects. Since the “New Democracy” regime, which resulted from the Chinese resistance to the occupation of Japan and the geopolitical confrontation of the countries of the axis of different democracies. This is when the Popular Republic of China is proclaimed, such as the proclamation of the “new democracy” and comes awareness of the environmental crisis worldwide by China, with the regime to evolve into the so-called “ecological socialism” From 2003. It was necessary for the country to experience a model of industrialization common to the first experiences of socialism, and especially the capitalist countries. China's fundamental thesis is that all regimes can collaborate in building a new civilization, but this implies outdoor democratic reforms that are consigned in global civilization proposals, guaranteeing peace according to the principle of indivisibility of security. But I would like to point out the moment when the United Nations (UN), representing the whole world, became aware of the existence of an environmental crisis, from the Stockholm Conference, which took place in 1972. On the part of the organs of the socialist state, citizens and parties, it began in 2003. It is strange that issues like this never be debated to the West. The ideological confrontation that comes from the Cold War did not cease with Helsinquia's agreements, and therefore there are themes that are unknown to the West because of this harmful tradition of the Cold War, which has extended, and because the media have no openness. to discuss and present the proposals that China makes.
China is present and is an important actor in world meetings on environment and climate. Why do you understand that there is no discussion the West about the concept of eco-civilization?
It is not discussed why the West there is great ignorance about China and the reality of the country. The only advantage I have about most people who write and talk about China is that my relationship with the country is over 50 years old. I know how China was presented to the West 50 years ago. We lived [in Portugal], a fascist regime where information came to people with great difficulty. I have seen these years to all kinds of visions about China that lacked concrete information, because the country, until reform and openness, was a closed society. But this lack of information was general in the West. I also had visions that were not reality and I began to question myself if China's historical experience is unique, without parallel in the history of society, democracy and socialism, for its historical characteristics, hermeneutics, in the sense of method, analysis, analysis of concepts and starting points, which predominates the West, does not serve. But then let's go to the concrete issue, which is the responsibilities that China has in environmental matters.
Which, specifically, are…
One thing is the contribution that give China, India and other countries to global warming, because they are populations that represent most of humanity. There are technologies that are themselves polluting. But if we look at this angle we ended up falsifying reality, because greenhouse gases that exist in the atmosphere have been at least 150 years ago due to European and American industrialization. In terms of historical responsibility, the US is largely responsible [for global warming], and I cite official European Union data, for example. I speak of tons of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere in all these years.
Because they industrialized much earlier than China.
Yes, and presented an industry without this kind of environmental concerns. Therefore, this reality is hidden, which greenhouse gases have begun to pollute for 150 years and that it is not only today's contributions [which are the major causes of global warming].
Therefore, the idea that China is the main polluting country finds it wrong.
In current terms China and India can be the most polluting. But they are neither in “per capita” nor historically. What is really [in the Western discourse] is that they currently contribute [to global warming]. But then we have to see the trends where we are going to walk. But if we deepen this topic we have come to even less favorable conclusions to Western policies. China's environmental history can be summed up at four periods. The first period is in the years of reform and openness, from 1978, and the fourth period is when China launches the pilot projects of ecological civilization. The process is global. Still in relation to China's responsibilities, in the first phase the West and the industrialized east carried to China the most polluting industries, because China's appeal was to industrialize and create more employment. The UN resolution that adds an article beyond the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, finally recognizes as an inalienable right of the human being to a healthy environment. This statement, the West, completely truncated, reduced to no thing, has a preamble with 30 articles in which the environmental issue is not posed. Since this statement is no longer in line with current political and social reality, it has been moving, mutilated and reduced to formal freedoms. Also ignored by the set of citizens who do not know their origin either. China is co-founder of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a fact that is also concealed. But I also wanted to talk about the largest fallacy of the Western environmental policy.
What is it?
The idea that, from now on, one will protect nature. So what is done to what was destroyed? Especially in developing countries, because it was there that we sent these residues from the polluting industries and exploited all resources. No one wanted to know that, and what did China did? He assumed the leadership of the process and through his diplomacy to "act without acting," Tao's way, without violating nature, respecting the laws and dignity of things, approving the Kunming-Montreal agreement [on biodiversity]. We then have a commitment that the US probably will lie down to the rubbish crate to recover the biotypes that are destroyed, because much of the world is in environmental crisis and has so far been whistling to the side. China has a gradual view that risk factors in the environmental crisis tend to decrease with China's effort, both nationally and international. But the most remarkable issue in the idea of ​​building an ecological state in the country was the fact that, at the initiative of President XI Jinping, principles of environmental philosophy were included in the Statutes of the Chinese Communist Party, unprecedented in another Communist Party and even some ecologists.

According to the study “Ecological Civilization in the People's Republic of China: Values, Action, and Future Needs”, by Arthur Hanson, published in 2019 by Asian Development Bank, the concept of ecological civilization “is being used by the Popular Republic of China ( RPC) to provide a coherent conceptual framework for adjustments to the development that responds to the challenges of the century XXI.
It differs from sustainable development in the emphasis placed in political and cultural factors, as well as in the definition of new relationships between people and nature that allow you to live well and within the eco-environmental boundaries of planet Earth. ”
In addition to reducing pollution and promoting the circular economy, for example, they are also considered “domains of finance, law, institutional reinforcement and technological innovation”, having already been defined some ideas in five-year plans approved by Beijing, highlighting If "needs in the medium term, especially until 2035, when ecological civilization, in its basic form, is expected to be fully implemented for the modernization of the RPC".</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 00:36:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Mark O'Neil launches biographical work on Liang Sicheng and contribution to Chinese architecture</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/20/mark-oneil-lanca-obra-biografica-sobre-liang-sicheng-e-contributo-para-a-arquitectura-chinesa/</link><description>Mark O'Neill, a journalist and author to reside in Hong Kong, published a biography of Liang Sicheng, responsible for documenting ancient Chinese architecture, which during the cultural revolution was the target of political persecution. The book written by the author of English origin, released by the publisher Joint, calls itself “Liang Sicheng: Guardian of the architectural history of China”
 
When did you contact Liang Sicheng's figure?
When I lived in Beijing I was interested in the old part of the city, for it was like no other in the world. Liang Sicheng said the following about this old part of Beijing: “The general layout shows the traditional system of the historic cities of China, being the result of geography, political and economic conditions of Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. It also expresses artistic management that led to a high level of success. It served the feudal era well and also serves life very well in the new age. It may be the capital of the New Age. This in no way prevents good development. All this creativity over a long time makes us proud. ” In the 1950s, Liang and a collaborator prepared a proposal of 25,000 characters for the construction of a new administrative center in the western part of the city, to house all the ministries and official buildings and leave the old city as it was. But the new government rejected this proposal and demolished most of the old city. Built its new capital in the center of the ancient city. This broke the heart of Liang and his wife Lin Huiyin. In Beijing, I met Liang's second wife, Lin Zhu. She explained all these dramatic events. It was a stimulus to write the book. Both she and her daughter, Liang Zaibing, wrote excellent books that describe all this. They were a fundamental research material for the book.
What do you consider most fascinating in Liang Sicheng's career?
I greatly admire Liang's aesthetic values ​​and his meticulous work in the documentation of China's old buildings, 2,738 in total. In 1944, in the midst of the worst horrors of the Japan war against China, which killed many of his friends and family, he wrote a letter to the US military representative in Chongqing. He made a list of historic places in Nara, Kyoto and Osaka, and proposed that they be spared to destroy the American bombers. What generosity and meaning of extraordinary humanity. In 2009, Nara raised a statue in her honor. He lived during the anti-Japanese war and the terrible campaigns of the beginning of the communist period. But it maintained its meaning of mission: preserving the treasures of Chinese architecture and forming a new generation of architects and the University of Tsinghua.
What are the main architectural currents, or specific buildings, which Liang helped preserve or draw attention?
He and his wife [Lin Huiyin] documented 2,738 old buildings with precious, Chinese and English measurements, and caught the national and international attention to them. Without it, many could have been destroyed or dropped into the degradation process. He defined the characteristics of traditional Chinese architecture and described the architects and artisans who built it.
It can be said that as intellectual, Liang Sicheng suffered persecution during the Cultural Revolution. In concrete terms, how was this period for Liang?
In chapter 10, we describe the Cultural Revolution as the Liang Calvary, as was for thousands of intellectuals and party officials [Chinese Communist Party]. Liang lived and worked at the University of Tsinghua campus. The government handed the campus control to frivolous red guards. Liang was an obvious target for them because he had studied in the United States, spoke English and had many foreign friends. The persecution he suffered was so severe that he eventually led him to death. In 1966, his health was already fragile; I was 65 years old. He was forced to write “self-confessions” and to attend mass critic sessions. The red guards looted their apartment. But he did not commit any crime, he was simply an architect and teacher. The criticism was absurd.
After the years of the Mao regime, two of his works were published. What do we tell us about the country's architecture?
After Mao's death and the end of the cultural revolution, he was rehabilitated and his works were published in Chinese and English. Its greatest legacy is the explanation of the history of Chinese architecture, the analysis of the old buildings and the techniques used to build them. One of the most famous is the Fo Guang Si Buddhist Temple, located in the Wutai mountains in Shanxi. Liang Sicheng caught the attention of the Chinese and foreign world to this legacy.
Liang Sicheng was one of the few architects of the time with foreign formation. What were the main influences revealed in the main architectural projects of the time?
Liang and his wife, as well as a small number of Chinese colleagues formed abroad, brought back to China the modern architecture. He taught her at the University of Northeast in Shenyang from 1928 to 1931, and at the University of Tsinghua, from 1945 to his death, and during the Cultural Revolution, these classes became impossible. This is another important legacy - the hundreds of architects who formed and the textbooks he wrote to them. In the global memory of ancient Chinese architecture, his work was fundamental. He launched the foundations for it. Since then, many have followed their example in the investigation, both Chinese and foreigners.
Liang Sicheng, an “extraordinary life” devotes to architecture
According to an official note about the work, released by the publisher Joint Publishing, Liang Sicheng had "an extraordinary life." Son of Liang Qi-Chao, one of China's most famous intellectuals, Liang Sicheng grew up in Japan. Educated at the University of Pennsylvania, Liang also studied at Harvard and was greatly influenced by American architects and architecture.
One of the few Chinese of his time with deep knowledge about modern architecture, Liang Sicheng returned to China in 1928 and spent more than 12 years to investigate the architecture of ancient China, continuing his work even during the years of World War II, when the years China was partially occupied by the Japanese.
He published his discoveries in Chinese and English newspapers, revealing to the world for the first time the history, knowledge and beauty of Chinese architecture. After World War II, he taught at Yale University and was the representative of China in the conception of the new United Nations (UN) headquarters in New York.
Post-1949 Life
After 1949, he remained in Beijing as head of the Architecture Department of the University of Tsinghua. He designed the main buildings of the new communist regime, but failed to persuade President Mao Zedong to preserve the ancient city of Beijing. In the 1950s, and in the years of the Cultural Revolution, it was severely criticized.
In January 1972 eventually died in the Chinese capital. With the end of the cultural revolution, his figure and reputation were rehabilitated and his own posthumously published. In 1984, his “pictorial history of Chinese architecture” was published in English by Wilma Fairbank, friend of the architect and his wife, and married to the synologist John Fairbank.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Ricardo Clara Couto, author of the documentary about Francisco de Pina | The weight of the guilt that persists</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/05/ricardo-clara-couto-autor-do-documentario-sobre-francisco-de-pina-o-peso-da-culpa-que-persiste/</link><description>“Francisco de Pina - The Portuguese who wrote the future of Vietname” tells the story of Father Jesuit, born in Guarda in 1586, who made the romanization of the Vietnamese alphabet. The documentary, by Ricardo Clara Couto was funded by RTP2 and aired at the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center
How did you come across this character in Portuguese history in the East?
My brother, named Filipe Pires, traveled for Vietnam for a while and when he arrived from the trip he told me that he had to know the incredible history of the Jesuit Francis of Pina who had made the romanization of the Vietnamese alphabet, providing freedom and cultural independence tremendous. I was a little skeptical at first, because I found it strange no one to know this in Portugal, but I started my research on the subject and discovered a university study of a Franco-Vietnamese teacher who teaches in Madeira. I then confirmed that the idea that my brother had brought from Vietname was correct. From there, I tried to discover the origin of this priest, the work he had done, and realize why there was so little knowledge about Francisco de Pina in Portugal.
In addition to being a Jesuit missionary, can you highlight some biographical points that help you understand your legacy?
In the documentary I did not have the time to be able to take a more exhaustive biographical approach. I focused on the part where he arrives at Vietname. We talk about a man with an incredible culture and a desire to acculturate and be acculturated. A man who was a musician and was easier, thus learning the Vietnamese, which is a six -tone language. Deep down, despite being a Jesuit priest, he had the first of course culture and not so much religion. This, for me, is a reason for huge admiration. For him the essential objective of evangelization was secondary, because, for him, if we could not understand the culture of Vietnam, we could not teach the Vietnamese people. It was more important to deepen local culture and language, making it possible to be able to explore the most religious part. It was also a man who had a hard time when he arrived at Vietname.
Why?
There were some internal wars before some local gentlemen of the regions who did not agree with the mission of the priests. This is not explored in the documentary, but in fact Francisco de Pina even made some steps [for the Jesuit mission], as the priests were not totally accepted everywhere. He eventually took refuge in a Japanese neighborhood and, from there, built his base.
Francisco de Pina, like what happened to many Jesuits at the time, was training in Macau, at the College of S. Paulo. How was it influenced by this period spent in the territory?
There is not much information about this time. It is known that it was indeed formed in this college, as was the case with many Jesuit priests at the time, but then went to Japan. Only then go to Vietname. So far, there was nothing of great relief in the life of Francisco de Pina, who followed the normal way. Japan was already expelling the Jesuit priests and it is in this context that goes to Vietname. The only most prominent thing about this period is that the 14 ships that left Portugal to arrive in Macau this year remained only three, and the ship where I was Pina Francisco was one of those who survived the storm.
Do you consider that your great legacy was the romanization of Vietnamese? What are the great contributions of this process in linguistic terms?
It is a giant contribution. If we think that even in the romanization of the language, Vietname was very dependent on the Chinese alphabet, and could not have cultural, linguistic and economic independence as well. After the romanization of the alphabet it was possible for Vietname to grow in these domains and have her own identity. The country has grown a lot to this day, because without writing a tongue passes only to the new generations of mouth in mouth, and the legacy of Francisco de Pina also remains today. The Vietnamese people are very grateful to this, and the proof is that two years ago a delegation of the Vietnammemesse Language Foundation Foundation came to Portugal and offered a monument to Guarda City Council (see Caixa) in honor of Francisco de Pina. However, I was surprised by the fact that the Vietnamese, and we talked about full -sided academics, know the story, the figure of Francisco de Pina, existing in the country several references. But in Portugal it is a little known figure.
How do you explain this?
I think this will have to do with the need Portugal has to make its catharsis about this period of history. Portugal was a completely different country from Africa to the East, and completely different from Africa to the Americas. But, however, there is this weight of guilt. Portugal cannot talk about this period of time, despite having a rich history between Africa and the East, but this time is not very approached because the country has not taken over what happened and, therefore, cannot talk about this period. Therefore, so much of the rich history of Portugal is unknown to the Portuguese.
How was the research process for the documentary?
I quickly arrived at the study of Professor Minh Ha Nguyen Lo Cicero of the University of Madeira, and with her we went to the roots of the Vietnamese language. When I discovered it was amazing, because it is part of the Vietnamese alphabet romanization triangle, as it is Franco-Vietnamese. Until recently, the official version that existed was that Alexandre de Rhodes, French Jesuit, had romanized the alphabet, later registering it in the Vatican and saying that it was a work in honor of his master, Francisco de Pina. However, the name of Francisco de Pina disappeared. From here we passed to the nationalist French official narrative that the romanization of the alphabet had been made by French because Vietname was a French colony. Then I also arrived at Professor António Morgado. The remaining contacts were made at Vietname, linguists, university professors and language specialists, especially in writing, who later joined the documentary.
How would you describe the Vietname of the time of Francisco de Pina?
It was very fragmented. They have a very their own culture that existed through a writing with Chinese hieroglyphics, but deals with Vietnamese, which led only 1 to 3 percent of the population to read and write. With the romanization this percentage increased exponentially, and with this the culture developed with the populations, united them more around common writing. I think this has made Vietname more modern and prepared to integrate into the rest of the world by having a more affordable language.
Do you feel it will help unravel this part of the history of Portugal, as well as the history of the Jesuit mission itself?
I hope so. Portugal seems to have a certain fear and shame to talk about this time, and proof of this is that this Vietnamese people came to Guard to offer a monument and practically did not come out of the subject. In addition, the representatives of the Vietname delegation were a little admired for not being received at an official level, except for the mayor of Guarda. I, who was invited by them to be present, felt a little shame of others, because Vietname came to Portugal to offer a monument and this is viewed as a secondary event, which is not. It would be important to make known this priest and this made to the country and the world, because Portugal and Vietnam have a very close and rich cultural history, as with Japan and China. But this is a little known aspect of the Portuguese people and [this documentary] can be a good opportunity for the country to make their catharsis.
Vietnamese artist sculpture resembles Francisco de Pina at Guarda
In November 2023, the Vietnamese Language Foundation offered the city of Guarda the sculpture “Nova Estela” by Vietnamese artist Nguyen Huy Anh. The work can be seen in the Garden of the Eduardo Lourenço Municipal Library. According to news from the agency Ecclesia, the event took place under the celebrations of the 824th anniversary of the attribution of Foral by King D. Sancho I to the city. “This is a posthumous tribute to Father Francisco de Pina, a Guarda-born Jesuit priest in 1586, whose religious path underwent a mission in Vietname, where he lived nine years of intense missionary activity, linguistics and of interculturality, ”said the Diocese of the Guard, in a statement.
According to the same note, the missionary Francisco de Pina was responsible for the introduction of the Latin alphabet and diacritical signs in the transcription of the sounds and tones of the Vietnamese language, which used, in writing, Chinese characters.
The priest embarked for over 400 years at the Nau de Nossa Senhora do Mount of Carmo, having completed the training at the São Paulo College in Macau and received the priestly ordination in Malaca. It was then called to the newly created Mission of the Jesuit Cchinchina, a zone that corresponds to the central part of the current Vietname. “He never came to the city where he was born and now returned in a bronze -carved boat by Vietnamese artists brought by the distant Vietname sea. From now on, Father Francisco de Pina will be in the historical memory of the guard and its inhabitants, materialized in this boat that brought him back to his city, leaving the name of the guard far, also written in Bronze letters ” , concluded the diocese.</description><pubDate>2025-02-05 00:46:19</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion expropriated from any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death , systematically carried out to this day (still in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the county).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Motorcycling | FHO RACING WITH NEW FOCUS IN 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/motociclismo-fho-racing-com-novo-foco-em-2025/</link><description>Doubts dissipated this week. Macau's businesswoman Foye Ho's FHO Racing will continue to active in the 2025 season, but without the initially announced riders. Peter Hickman and Davey Todd are leaving and goes to a new team called 8ten Racing
 
According to a statement sent by FHO Racing, BMW Motorrad UK has restructured its training for the 2025 British Superbike Championship, and FHO Racing BMW will compete with a single pilot aboard a BMW M 1000 RR. German 2024 Superbike Champion and Resistance World Cup driver, Ilya Mikhalchik, will make his debut in the British competition, at a time when team owner Faye Ho, realinhas the objectives of his team “to explore new activities in sports Motorized in new markets, with the support of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport ”.
Currently in his fifth year at the British Superbike Championship Paddock, Faye Ho has been a strong presence in the British competition, as well as in the popular road races, such as the Macao Grand Prix, as well as supporting several young women's pilots, helping to progress in their careers from the lower classes. Faye Ho, Stanley Ho's granddaughter and Clementina Leitão, has supported Kate Walker and Jamie Hanks-Bliott on BMW F 900 R Cup and, it seems, which will continue to support.

Contrary to the rumors that put her from Paddock's departure, Faye Ho made it clear that she is a “great advocate of the British Superbike Championship, one of the world's most exciting and competitive competitions” and will keep her commitment to discipline. However, the territory entrepreneur now has new objectives for herself and its structure. The future will be in Asia and support for young female talents.
“Given my long -term objectives, which include expanding motor sport activities in Asia and continuing to support young women in motorcycling, I realized that I can't dedicate the same time to the British Superbikes and road racing championship, I gave them since I became the owner of the team in 2021, due to the additional appointments I have in Macao, ”said Faye Ho.
Another chapter
This announcement has put an end to a successful partnership, particularly on the island of Man TT, between Peter Hickman, four times winner of the Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, and Fho Racing. Hickman left some words of thanks to his now former boss.
“I want to leave a huge thanks to Faye [Ho] and Fho Racing for all they have done for me over the past four years,” Hickman wrote in a Facebook social network post. “As it is normal in motorized sport, we had amazing moments and others more difficult, but Fho has always been and always will be a fundamental part of my career. I will be eternally grateful for this opportunity. ”
The new 8Ten Racing team, which will be officially presented on February 26, will be mostly composed of former FHO Racing elements. Hickman and Todd will maintain the important support of BMW Motorrad UK and are expected on the big prize starting grid in November.</description><pubDate>2025-02-13 01:30:05</pubDate></item><item><title>FHO RACING | Peter Hickman denies closing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/07/fho-racing-peter-hickman-nega-encerramento/</link><description>Peter Hickman, four times winner of the Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, denied the rumors that claimed that Macau Faye Ho businesswoman Fho Racing would have closed the doors and would be absent on the British Superbike Championship grid (BSB championship ) and the Macao Grand Prix in 2025
 
Peter Hickman goes to the fifth season in the British Championship with Fho Racing, however, before the season's start, some rumors came to circulate in Paddock about the team's future. In recent years, FHO Racing has become one of the top teams in the British Superbike Championship and road events, such as the MAN's island TT or the Macao Grand Prix.
Last November, the team announced that they featured Peter Hickman and Davey Todd, winner of the troubled last edition of the Macao Grand Motor Prize in the British Superbike Championship. Faye Ho said at the time that “for 2025 and also for this year's Macao Grand Prix, we have a very strong team, with Davey joining Pete and Michael aboard the BMW. We have two super talented drivers on the roads for next season, and with Davey jumping to the Superbike class, after winning the Superstock Championship for the second time, I think we'll have a strong season. I can't expect my team to return to Macau, I love to share my hometown with the team and show all points of interest, it's such a special place for me. ”

The Macao Touring Car Cup winner in 2021 was away from motorsport at the time of 2023 for personal reasons, but last year made his debut in the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8 ). Despite the vast experience in specialty tests, having led several generations of tourism cars, Célio Alves Dias had never managed the new bobbinnings that the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC) introduced in its competition in 2023. Because it is learning, with some difficulties in the tuning and behavior of the Japanese car.
Participation in races at the Zhuzhou International Circuit and the Macau Grand Prix made Célio Alves Dias realize that his Toyota GR86 was not at the strongest competition level. Based on the conclusions drawn from these experiences, he decided to start preparing for the new season.
“The car had to be all dismantled. My car was bought on Monday, and the chassis and the security arc, for me, were not well done, ”explained Fu Lei Racing Team pilot to HM. “This, made the car too hard and very difficult to bow. I tried a car from China, which was well assembled, and there is a difference. I had a long time in January, in China, with this car. Our cars, made in the same workshop, were very hard, which made it difficult to make turns fast. ”
If at the Macao Grand Prix, the house drivers, excellent guide circuit, managed to equate their progress to their hong Kong opponents and the interior of China, in the initial races on the Zhuzhou track, in Hunan province, was not well. “There are many differences between cars, but especially in chassis, because engines, in terms of power and horses, are almost all at the same level. Our opponents also experienced many pieces, many engines, even gearboxes, and chassis. Competition cars are always the same. You have to have engine power, but also chassis. Having only power is not enough. Having better a good chassis is the most important. ”
Silver Jubilee in November
Being a usual Portuguese name in the Macao Grand Prix in recent decades, Célio Alves Dias debuted at the Guide Circuit in 2000 and since then it was a frequent presence and no faults in the race until 2023. This year, its objective is to account for Its twenty -fifth participation in the largest sports event of annual ram character, but will have to align in the findings of determination.
While awaiting the announcement of the 2025 calendar by AAMC, Célio Alves Dias details details to start his test program, because his Toyota, after being reviewed, "is ready to test" inside China, something that It will happen “very soon,” says the pilot.
In the last edition of the Grand Prix, Célio Alves Dias qualified in 12th place for the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. However, his participation was short and unhappy: at the wheel of Toyota with dorsal No. 11, was forced to give up after being immobilized on the climb of San Francisco.

On the eve of last Christmas, Sro Motorsport Group, the entity responsible for organizing numerous races and championships, including the GT World Challenge Asia and, as the official partner of the FIA, the co-coordination of the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau , announced the creation of a competition for GT4 vehicles, consisting of four events in China. At the time of the announcement, only the inaugural event in Shanghai and the end in Beijing had been confirmed as part of the calendar.
Almost 30 cars, representing an impressive total of ten car builders, participated in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race of 2024, a race that has become an important milestone over the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix in recent years. Indeed, no other GT4 event in Asia brings together such quantity and diversity of cars. The Balance of Performance (BOP), responsible for balancing the performance of the various participating cars, was, at the time, managed by SRO.

Its inclusion in the 2025 calendar of the SRO underlines the size of our ambition for this new national series. ”
High interest
The SRO GT Cup debut season starts in March at China's Formula 1 Grand Prix in Shanghai, before moving to the Zhuhai International Circuit - a place previously visited by SRO in BPR times and the FIA ​​GT Championship - where two 30 minutes races are planned. This is followed by the new Citadine Circuit of Beijing, which will host the GT World Challenge Asia on the same weekend, before the big end of the Sro GT Cup season, scheduled for a month later at the Guide Circuit in Macao.
The enthusiasm surrounding this competition is evident. As Benjamin Franassovici said, “This is reflected in the number of consultations and registration for the full season we have received since the release of the championship, just before Christmas. The demand has exceeded our expectations. ”
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the season end event on the streets of Macau, with places to be assigned based on the classification after the second round of the championship, which is scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit. All pilots with “bronze” or “silver” classifications attributed by the FIA ​​are eligible to compete in this competition, as long as they use approved cars from the GT4 class.

SRO GT CUP joins its Asian equivalent, Japan Cup, in a list that also includes continental and national competitions in Europe, America and Australia.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 11:13:41</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Rui Valente is not due</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/21/automobilismo-rui-valente-nao-se-da-por-vencido/</link><description>Rui Valente will return this year for another season in motorsport in the region. The Macao pilot has been in the active for the same time and will play the Macau Roadsport Challenge, the tourist cars competition organized by the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), as well as the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix , in November
 
With the same enthusiasm recognized for decades, Rui Valente will again drive, in the 2025 season, a Subaru BRZ, the same car with which he competed in the Guide Circuit last November in the Macao Roadsport Challenge race. In the event held at the event of the territory, the Portuguese pilot finished sixth place, after losing some positions in the start, where he descended to tenth. The result was not even better because the rain -played race ended prematurely due to an opponent's accident.
In the competition for local pilots, which currently combines starting grids with more than half a hundred cars, all of them Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8), Rui Valente admitted to HM that “not being overcome”, revealing still who is “missing the podium, both in China and Macau…”.

These improvements, along with lock system updates, should increase the competitiveness of the Japanese machine in a fierce grid, consisting of Macau, Hong Kong pilots and China interior, with constantly evolving cars.

The AAMC -organized car competition calendar has not yet been revealed. In 2024, Macao Roadsport Challenge debuted at the Zhuzhou International Circuit in East of Hunan Province, but Rui Valente would rather the competition returned to the Guangdong International Circuit (GIC) in Zhaoqing.
“I was very fond of returning to Gic, because I have everything there,” says the Portuguese pilot, defender of the track located in the neighboring province. “When you go to a qualification test, for those who make four races and then Macau, if you are on a track you already know, such as GIC, where you are seven or more years, each time you get on the track and try to do better than which last means you are improving and improving your driving. So you know you soon that you are stronger that year to Macau. ”
On the other hand, for the experienced pilot of the territory, “if you go to a new track, like the Zhuzhou circuit, besides floors there to learn the new layout and improve your time, you will never know if you are really stronger For Macao, as you know when you run in the gic. ”
Like what happened in past seasons, the Macau Roadsport Challenge calendar is expected to be composed of two weekends, with two races each, which also serve as an investigation for the Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-01-21 23:47:48</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
