In an opinion article published yesterday in the British newspaper Financial Times, Macron highlights that China's trade surplus with the rest of the world has already reached one billion dollars, and that the imbalance with the EU has doubled in the last decade, reaching 300 billion euros. “This situation is not sustainable, neither for Europe nor for China”, he observes.
The French head of state recognizes that the current wave of Chinese exports to the European market is partly due to tariffs imposed by the United States and weak domestic consumption in China. However, it states that “responding with tariffs and quotas would be a non-cooperative solution”.
Macron rather calls for a coordinated approach that involves three fronts: strengthening European competitiveness, mobilizing savings for domestic investment and encouraging structural reforms in the Chinese economy. “Europe’s first step must be to implement a new economic agenda based on competitiveness, innovation and protection”, he argues.
Macron defended Europe's right to adopt a “European preference” to support strategic sectors such as automobiles, energy, health and technology, as long as they comply with international rules. “Protecting against unfair competition is the basis of resilience”, he maintains.
As for financing this transformation, the French President proposes channeling part of the approximately 30 billion euros in savings accumulated in the EU – of which 300 billion are invested annually abroad – to European companies. “It’s time for us Europeans to take the risk of investing in our own companies”, he argues.
Eyes on China
Macron emphasizes, however, that China also has responsibilities. “Beijing needs to correct its internal imbalances”, he states, defending a fiscal policy that is more favorable to consumption and the transition to a service economy. The French President also calls for a rebalance in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, recalling that the EU invested around 240 billion euros in China, while Chinese investment in Europe was below 65 billion.
“Europe must remain open to Chinese investment in sectors where China leads, as long as this contributes to employment, innovation and technological sharing”, he writes. Macron reiterates his call for a framework of economic cooperation between the EU, China and the US, warning that, in the absence of progress, Europe will have to resort to “firmer measures”.
"I prefer cooperation. But, if necessary, I will defend the use of protectionist measures", he warns, adding that the French presidency of the G7, next year, will put the rebalancing of global asymmetries at the top of the agenda. “I believe that, if we truly take into account the needs and interests of each person, we can build an international macroeconomic agenda that benefits everyone”, he states.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:21:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Light Rail | Qingmao will be a hub for several lines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/metro-ligeiro-qingmao-vai-ser-centro-de-ligacao-de-varias-linhas/</link><description>The Qingmao Light Metro station will be added to connect different lines, meaning that the cost of the works has risen to MOP7.59 billion, compared to MOP3.04 billion originally.

Ferreira presents new film about terrorist group FP-25</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/ivo-m-ferreira-apresenta-novo-filme-sobre-grupo-terrorista-fp-25/</link><description>It’s called “Global Project” and it’s the new film by Ivo M. Ferreira, a Portuguese director who previously lived in the territory. The presentation to the world of cinema is scheduled to take place at the Rotterdam International Film Festival, in January, which takes place in the Netherlands.
The feature film is part of the “Big Screen” competition, whose narrative is “anchored in the early 1980s, when Portugal was the scene of attacks and robberies perpetrated by the 25 de Abril Popular Forces (FP-25)”.
Ivo M. Ferreira's project, described by the festival as a political thriller “set in the turbulent years after the 'Carnation Revolution'”, features actors such as Jani Zhao, Rodrigo Tomás, José Pimentão, Gonçalo Waddington, Isac Graça, João Catarré, Ivo Canelas, Hugo Bentes, Isabél Zuaa, later giving rise to a series for RTP. According to the producer, the film “Projecto Global” will premiere in Portuguese cinemas on April 23rd of next year.
The story focuses on Lisbon in 1980, when Rosa, Jaime and their FP-25 comrades “slide into an armed spiral where morale unravels, loyalty falters and each step opens a deeper abyss”. “Apart from themselves and with the dreams of the past in ruins, they no longer recognize the country they are crossing, and even less the people they have become”, describes the synopsis.
Ivo M. Ferreira is also linked to the local cinema scene, having directed the feature film “Hotel Império” in Macau in 2016, starring Margarida Vila-Nova. His film, “Letters from War”, was also shown in Macau.
Salvador's debut
Another Portuguese film premiering at the Rotterdam film festival is “A Providência e a Guitarra”, by João Nicolau, having its world premiere here, outside of competition. This is a project that was born from a short story by writer Robert Louis Stevenson, and is performed by Pedro Inês, Clara Riedenstein, Isac Graça, Jenna Thiam, Américo Silva and musician Salvador Sobral.
Shot in the summer of 2024, the film is presented as “a dive into the hardships and delights of artistic life and an exploration of its consequences” on marital and social relationships, and marks Salvador Sobral's debut in cinema. “A Providência e a Guitarra” is produced by O Som e a Fúria.
In Rotterdam, the program for short and medium-length films will also include the short films “O”, by actress and director Francisca Alarcão, an experimental fiction about an aversion to navels, and “Computer”, by visual artist Alice dos Reis, which “intertwines history and fiction in a fun narrative about the female perspective and self-determination”, describes the festival. The 55th Rotterdam Film Festival will take place from January 29th to February 8th in the Netherlands.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:16:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Housing | Fewer transactions and cheaper homes</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/habitacao-menos-transaccoes-e-casas-mais-baratas/</link><description>The housing market continues to decline consistently.

The approval, which comes two days after the group's shareholders voted in favor, required opinions from several public services
It's official. The L’Arc casino is part of the portfolio of properties operated by the gaming concessionaire SJM Resorts. The Government gave the green light to the deal yesterday through an order from the Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam Vai Man, published in the Official Bulletin.
The approval allows gaming to operate, beyond December 31, 2025, at the only satellite casino in the territory to survive the changes that regulate the casino industry.
Therefore, the order from the Secretary for Transport and Public Works indicates that “the transfer of the concession was authorized, in accordance with what was proposed in the opinion of the Land Commission”, after the request to transfer the fraction where the casino and hotel is located was presented on November 11th.
In the request, SJM claimed that the “transmission aims to maintain the continuous exploration and operation of the casino existing in that autonomous fraction, which operates as a satellite casino, transforming it into a casino belonging to the gaming concessionaire”. In addition to the positive opinion of the Land Commission, after a meeting on December 4th, the transfer received approval from several public services.
“After gathering the opinions of the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Directorate and the Tourism Services Directorate, the request was assessed by the Land and Urban Construction Services Directorate, which ruled in favor as there were no outstanding prizes, fees, rents, fees or taxes relating to the concession and there was no evidence that the transfer was requested for speculative purposes”, is stated in the order from Raymond Tam Vai Man.
Step by step
The building where the casino is located has “62 floors, including two refuge floors, two mezzanine floors and three basement floors, intended for housing, commerce, a 5-star hotel, residential parking and hotel parking”.
It is recalled that SJM Holdings held an extraordinary general meeting on Monday where shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the acquisition of the former satellite casino L’Arc, according to a note sent by the group to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The acquisition, approved by 99.93 percent, will cost HK$1.75 billion.
Nine of Macau's 11 “satellite casinos” have already closed. The last to close its doors, on December 9th, was Fortuna, with more than 550 employees. The tenth, Landmark, which has 1,169 workers, will close on December 30th.
SJM highlighted that all employees of the 'satellite casinos' with resident status in Macau and directly hired by the company have guaranteed employment in other casinos in the group. As for other local workers, “they are invited to apply for related vacancies” within the group, “with priority for hiring” and with conditions equal to those they had.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:00:12</pubDate></item><item><title>FAOM | New leadership led by Lam Lon Wai wants more patriotism</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/faom-nova-direccao-liderada-por-lam-lon-wai-quer-mais-patriotismo/</link><description>Promoting patriotism is the top priority of the new leadership of the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau, which will be led by deputy Lam Lon Wai

Sam Hou Fai stressed that the Government will “seriously” study and understand the guidelines given by Xi Jinping, “as well as firmly implement them” in next year’s Lines of Government Action.
It is recalled that Xi Jinping indicated that Sam Hou Fai led the new Government of the Macao SAR in resolute advancement and pragmatic action, in the firm defense of the country's sovereignty, security and development interests, “fully recognizing the work carried out by the Chief Executive and the Government of the Macao SAR”. The Chinese President stressed that governance must be linked to the 15th Five-Year Plan, “insisting and improving the predominance of Executive power, solidly promoting the development of adequate diversification of the economy, constantly increasing the efficiency of governance and better integrating the national development situation and serving it”.

The Secretary for Economy and Finance, Anton Tai Kin Ip, also stated that he will implement President Xi Jinping's important guidelines. Furthermore, he guaranteed that “the functions of ‘a center, a platform, a base’ will be consolidated, taking advantage of Macau’s unique advantage as a ‘precision interlocutor’ between China and Portuguese-speaking countries to promote cooperation with these countries”. The secretary added that his authority is committed to expanding international exchanges, “well narrating the Macau chapter of the Stories of China”.

Bárbara Morais, main writer of the document, explains the main conclusions of the analysis
On December 3rd, a White Paper was launched that provides a look and analysis of the way in which cooperation in scientific and technological areas between China, Macau and Portuguese-speaking countries has been taking place, outlining some criticisms, not only on this topic, but also on the economic direction that the Macao SAR is taking.
The document, entitled “White Paper on Scientific and Technological Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries”, was produced by the City University of Macau (UCM) and had Bárbara Morais, a doctoral student at the institution, as main writer.
In an interview with HM, she describes that, in Macau, “economic diversification has advanced at a slower pace than desired, keeping the economy structurally dependent on gambling and tourism”.
"The central message of the White Paper is clear: Macau needs to accelerate the transition to functions with greater added value. However, the current context offers a renewed window of opportunity. With the support of the Greater Bay Area and, very specifically, the Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin, Macau now has new structural opportunities to recover lost momentum and reposition itself, not just as a cultural bridge, but as a true platform for innovation", he said.
Still on the territory, but in relation to Forum Macau, the “success in institutionalizing political dialogue” is mentioned, but the White Paper “points the finger at the insufficiency of execution mechanisms”. “To streamline the role of the Forum and transform it into a tool for tangible results, the White Paper advocates a paradigm shift: it is necessary to move from declarations of intent to technicality”, describes Bárbara Morais. The doctoral student suggests “the creation of specialized technical working groups, especially in the technological sphere, and the rigorous definition of performance indicators, such as the number of registered patents, startups created or joint research projects”.
“At the same time, it is suggested to establish a common agenda focused on areas of the future, such as green energy, health, the maritime economy and artificial intelligence, subject to a periodic assessment of progress”, he also said.
The place of arbitration
Taking these meager developments into account, the White Paper suggests that Macau assert itself “as a center for technological arbitration and intellectual property governance”.
HM questioned Bárbara Morais about what should be done in effective terms, taking into account the existence, for several years, of an arbitration center, and the fact that it has been a topic on the territory's political agenda for a long time. The doctoral student highlights that “in order for these ideas, debated for years, to stop being rhetoric and become reality, the Macao SAR needs to create a legal framework specialized in technological disputes aligned with the most demanding international standards”.
"It is essential to attract international experts and arbitrators through competitive incentives and establish an arbitration center that enjoys recognition both in Portuguese-speaking countries and in the Greater Bay Area. The objective is to develop mediation, certification and management services for intellectual property assets, positioning Macau as a 'safe haven', neutral and efficient, for the resolution of international technological disputes", he added.
Unequal cooperation
In global terms, and with regard to cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries (PLP), the White Paper refers to “top planning” by Beijing for cooperation in universities and scientific research. However, planning “does not translate, linearly, into equally effective execution mechanisms on the ground, nor does it guarantee homogeneous results among the nine Portuguese-speaking countries”.
Planning implies “clear guidelines, defined priorities and diplomatic instruments mobilized to guide this cooperation”, with policies such as “Made in China 2025” or the “Digital Silk Road”, which “integrate technological cooperation with the PLP into the very core of Chinese foreign policy and national innovation”, highlights the author.
However, there are “inequalities, which are perhaps the most striking feature of this relationship”, as Bárbara Morais explains. “The current scenario reveals a profound asymmetry, characterized by a ‘bicephaly’ in cooperation. (…) The main scientific capabilities, the robust technological infrastructure and the volume of effective cooperation are overwhelmingly concentrated in Portugal and Brazil”. On the contrary, “Portuguese-speaking African countries (PALOP) and Timor-Leste have a significantly lower participation”.
According to Bárbara Morais, the “disparity does not arise from a lack of political will, but rather from structural funding limitations, a shortage of qualified human resources and the fragility of local research institutions”. Thus, there is “two-speed cooperation, very asymmetrical within the Portuguese-speaking community itself”.
The White Paper highlights the “historic crossroads” in relation to cooperation between China and the PLP, which means “the urgent need to move from potential to implementation” in this matter.
"There are ambitious visions and strategic plans, but practical results remain below what is possible. To resolve this crossroads, the proposed path involves strengthening execution mechanisms, investing massively in talent and technical-scientific education, creating ecosystems of genuine collaborative innovation between China, Macau and the PLP, and, above all, having the courage to measure results and reformulate strategies based on empirical evidence, abandoning the discourse of circumstance in favor of economic and scientific pragmatism."
Gaps in Africa
Another of the conclusions of the White Paper is the “tenuity” of academic links with the African continent, which Bárbara Morais describes as a “fragile scenario”. “There is a triad of factors: the scarcity of installed scientific capacity, the chronic lack of funding and consistent mobility programs”, without forgetting “the absence of stable joint research structures”.
“To bridge this gap and create a lasting critical mass, the White Paper is not limited to diagnosis, suggesting concrete measures such as the robust reinforcement of research grants, the creation of joint doctoral programs, the implementation of collaborative laboratories and the design of academic mobility mechanisms specifically oriented to the African reality”, he adds.
The document also talks about the negative impact of “geopolitical asymmetries”, such as the “technological restrictions of the European Union and NATO on Portugal”. According to Bárbara Morais, “real and restrictive impacts” are at stake. "These limitations condition the participation of Portugal and, by extension, of other Portuguese-speaking actors that cooperate in a network with Lisbon, in high-technology projects that involve China. The impact is particularly sensitive in critical areas such as 5G telecommunications, defense, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, creating barriers that require complex diplomatic navigation."
New strategies
The White Paper was developed at the UCM Research Institute on Portuguese-Speaking Countries, and written by Bárbara Morais with the participation of academic João Simões. The project is based on a review of academic literature on the topic and also on the results of the “Technological Cooperation Launch Seminar”, held on July 22, 2025 at UCM.
The work analyzes areas such as “strategic evolution”, “institutional mechanisms”, “technological milestones” and “structural challenges”, aiming to “provide evidence-based strategies to transform the potential of the China-PLP partnership into a concrete reality, creating a new model of technological cooperation for the Global South”, says a statement from UCM.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 00:53:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Macron calls for rebalancing relations with China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/macron-apela-a-reequilibrio-nas-relacoes-com-a-china/</link><description>French President Emmanuel Macron defended an urgent rebalance in economic relations between the European Union (EU) and China, warning that, without progress, Brussels could be forced to adopt more protectionist measures.
In an opinion article published yesterday in the British newspaper Financial Times, Macron highlights that China's trade surplus with the rest of the world has already reached one billion dollars, and that the imbalance with the EU has doubled in the last decade, reaching 300 billion euros. “This situation is not sustainable, neither for Europe nor for China”, he observes.
The French head of state recognizes that the current wave of Chinese exports to the European market is partly due to tariffs imposed by the United States and weak domestic consumption in China. However, it states that “responding with tariffs and quotas would be a non-cooperative solution”.
Macron rather calls for a coordinated approach that involves three fronts: strengthening European competitiveness, mobilizing savings for domestic investment and encouraging structural reforms in the Chinese economy. “Europe’s first step must be to implement a new economic agenda based on competitiveness, innovation and protection”, he argues.
Macron defended Europe's right to adopt a “European preference” to support strategic sectors such as automobiles, energy, health and technology, as long as they comply with international rules. “Protecting against unfair competition is the basis of resilience”, he maintains.
As for financing this transformation, the French President proposes channeling part of the approximately 30 billion euros in savings accumulated in the EU – of which 300 billion are invested annually abroad – to European companies. “It’s time for us Europeans to take the risk of investing in our own companies”, he argues.

Macron emphasizes, however, that China also has responsibilities. “Beijing needs to correct its internal imbalances”, he states, defending a fiscal policy that is more favorable to consumption and the transition to a service economy. The French President also calls for a rebalance in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, recalling that the EU invested around 240 billion euros in China, while Chinese investment in Europe was below 65 billion.
“Europe must remain open to Chinese investment in sectors where China leads, as long as this contributes to employment, innovation and technological sharing”, he writes. Macron reiterates his call for a framework of economic cooperation between the EU, China and the US, warning that, in the absence of progress, Europe will have to resort to “firmer measures”.
"I prefer cooperation. But, if necessary, I will defend the use of protectionist measures", he warns, adding that the French presidency of the G7, next year, will put the rebalancing of global asymmetries at the top of the agenda. “I believe that, if we truly take into account the needs and interests of each person, we can build an international macroeconomic agenda that benefits everyone”, he states.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:21:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Light Rail | Qingmao will be a hub for several lines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/metro-ligeiro-qingmao-vai-ser-centro-de-ligacao-de-varias-linhas/</link><description>The Qingmao Light Metro station will be added to connect different lines, meaning that the cost of the works has risen to MOP7.59 billion, compared to MOP3.04 billion originally.

According to the president of the commission, who cited explanations from the Government, the number of stations will be increased from one to two, which combined with the costs of works, materials and systems to be installed, will increase the cost to 7.59 billion patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:01:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Commerce | Mannings closes all stores in the Interior</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/comercio-mannings-fecha-todas-as-lojas-no-interior/</link><description>On Tuesday, the Mannings Group announced the closure of all physical stores in the Interior as well as the online store and electronic platforms Tmall, JD and Pinduoduo.

Ferreira presents new film about terrorist group FP-25</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/ivo-m-ferreira-apresenta-novo-filme-sobre-grupo-terrorista-fp-25/</link><description>It’s called “Global Project” and it’s the new film by Ivo M. Ferreira, a Portuguese director who previously lived in the territory. The presentation to the world of cinema is scheduled to take place at the Rotterdam International Film Festival, in January, which takes place in the Netherlands.
The feature film is part of the “Big Screen” competition, whose narrative is “anchored in the early 1980s, when Portugal was the scene of attacks and robberies perpetrated by the 25 de Abril Popular Forces (FP-25)”.
Ivo M. Ferreira's project, described by the festival as a political thriller “set in the turbulent years after the 'Carnation Revolution'”, features actors such as Jani Zhao, Rodrigo Tomás, José Pimentão, Gonçalo Waddington, Isac Graça, João Catarré, Ivo Canelas, Hugo Bentes, Isabél Zuaa, later giving rise to a series for RTP. According to the producer, the film “Projecto Global” will premiere in Portuguese cinemas on April 23rd of next year.
The story focuses on Lisbon in 1980, when Rosa, Jaime and their FP-25 comrades “slide into an armed spiral where morale unravels, loyalty falters and each step opens a deeper abyss”. “Apart from themselves and with the dreams of the past in ruins, they no longer recognize the country they are crossing, and even less the people they have become”, describes the synopsis.
Ivo M. Ferreira is also linked to the local cinema scene, having directed the feature film “Hotel Império” in Macau in 2016, starring Margarida Vila-Nova. His film, “Letters from War”, was also shown in Macau.
Salvador's debut
Another Portuguese film premiering at the Rotterdam film festival is “A Providência e a Guitarra”, by João Nicolau, having its world premiere here, outside of competition. This is a project that was born from a short story by writer Robert Louis Stevenson, and is performed by Pedro Inês, Clara Riedenstein, Isac Graça, Jenna Thiam, Américo Silva and musician Salvador Sobral.
Shot in the summer of 2024, the film is presented as “a dive into the hardships and delights of artistic life and an exploration of its consequences” on marital and social relationships, and marks Salvador Sobral's debut in cinema. “A Providência e a Guitarra” is produced by O Som e a Fúria.
In Rotterdam, the program for short and medium-length films will also include the short films “O”, by actress and director Francisca Alarcão, an experimental fiction about an aversion to navels, and “Computer”, by visual artist Alice dos Reis, which “intertwines history and fiction in a fun narrative about the female perspective and self-determination”, describes the festival. The 55th Rotterdam Film Festival will take place from January 29th to February 8th in the Netherlands.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:16:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Music | Mariza in Macau for New Year's concert</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/musica-mariza-em-macau-para-concerto-de-ano-novo/</link><description>As part of the 2025-2026 concert season, the concert between Portuguese fado singer Mariza and the Macau Orchestra is scheduled for the last day of the year, in the large auditorium of the Macau Cultural Center. Here is a unique opportunity to see, or revisit, one of the great names of Fado, in a mix with classical music
Fado singer Mariza will perform in Macau in a concert that marks the arrival of a new year. “Mariza, the Queen of Fado and the Macau Orchestra (OM)” is the name given to this concert that takes place in the large auditorium of the Macau Cultural Center (CCM) on December 31st, starting at 8pm.
According to a note from the Cultural Institute (IC), Mariza will perform, “with her deeply emotional voice, a selection of iconic fados, providing the public with a musical experience that transcends genres and spatial and temporal boundaries”. The fado singer is described “as one of the biggest international Fado stars, being recognized for her own musical style, which incorporates elements of soul, jazz and gospel”.
"With her powerful voice, she has moved audiences on the most prestigious stages in the world. In this concert, Mariza will present with OM a repertoire that combines traditional and contemporary fado, enriched by the rhythms of Mornas from Cape Verde, 'rhythm and blues' and sounds from Brazil, Spain and Mozambique", being "a celebration of fado with a personal and diverse style".
Mariza made her world debut in 1999, having since released several Fado albums, with sales exceeding one million copies worldwide, winning over legions of admirers. She was named Best European World Music Artist three times by BBC Radio 3. The albums “Terra” and “Mundo” earned her nominations for the Latin Grammy Awards, consolidating her status as a global star and her musical influence.
The concert will last approximately 1h30 without intermission, and tickets are already on sale, with prices ranging between 180 and 400 patacas.
New sounds on the way
After releasing “Mariza Canta Amália” in 2020, the artist has dedicated herself to the stage. But last year he released a new single, “Casa”, in 2024, a song from the new album, “Amor”. The fado singer also released the single “Desamor”, which is also part of this album, and in which Mariza collaborates with another musician very different from herself – GSON, from the band Wet Bed Gang, a Portuguese rap group.
Quoted by Blitz magazine, during the presentation of “Desamor”, Mariza said that “it would be unlikely that two musicians from completely different backgrounds would meet, but our backgrounds are on the other side of history”. GSON said that “the fact that we are from different poles is what makes the difference in what is being done here”.
About the new album, Mariza told the same publication that she was inspired by the various forms of love that exist. “Love of longing, mother's love, family love... love, for me, is not just physical, it goes far beyond that.”
Meanwhile, OM announced another musical initiative, planned to take place next year. This is the “Esperança do Futuro” concert, scheduled for May 16th, and whose recruitment program for young local musicians ended on December 12th.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:15:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | Chinese tourism in Japan slows down in November</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/japao-turismo-chines-no-japao-desacelera-em-novembro/</link><description>The arrival of Chinese tourists to Japan slowed down in November, amid diplomatic tension between Tokyo and Beijing, despite the archipelago having registered a record number of foreign visitors, according to official data released yesterday. The total number of international tourist arrivals in November was 3,518,000, an increase of 10.4 percent compared to the same month in 2024, indicated the Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO).
Among the visitors, 562 thousand came from mainland China – a year-on-year increase of 3 percent, but well below previous months. In October, Japan had received 715 thousand Chinese tourists and, in September, 775 thousand – growth of close to 20 percent year-on-year.
“In addition to the demand for travel to Japan slowing down at this time of year, the Chinese Government warned the population to avoid traveling to the country”, said JNTO, highlighting that the year-on-year increase was also due to the greater supply of seats on flights.
The slowdown coincided with the recommendation issued by Chinese authorities following statements by Japanese Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, about Taiwan, which reignited diplomatic tensions between the two countries. Even so, between January and November, China remained the main source of tourists to Japan, with 8.7 million visitors, followed by South Korea (8.4 million).
In the first eleven months of 2025, Japan received 39,065,600 international visitors – 17 percent more than in the same period of the previous year –, already surpassing the record of 36.87 million registered in 2024 and approaching the target of 40 million by the end of this year.
The continued growth of tourism has fueled a national debate about the impacts of mass tourism, with some conservative parties demanding new restrictions on the entry of foreigners and stricter rules to preserve coexistence in local communities.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:18:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Initiative | Manifesto defends investment in technology</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/iniciativa-de-macau-manifesto-defende-aposta-na-tecnologia/</link><description>The International Forum for Civilizational Exchange ended yesterday with the release of the 'Macau Initiative' of a manifesto that calls on young people to take advantage of technology in the service of dialogue and cooperation between civilizations. At the closing ceremony, the president of the Macau Cultural Institute, which organized the forum, read the document, which “encourages young people to take advantage of new technologies, such as digitalization and smart applications”.
Leong Wai Man stated that it is necessary to train new generations “so that they become heirs and innovators of mutual learning between civilizations” and build a world that is “inclusive, cooperative and forward-looking”. The manifesto also defends the need to not only protect the shared heritage of humanity, but also to reinforce “the innovative use of the various forms of tangible and intangible cultural heritage”.
The document calls for “deep exploration of the contemporary value of the historical cultures of all countries”, using “creative transformation” to apply “traditional wisdom” in the modern world. Macau is the ideal place for this initiative, says the manifesto, due to the “valuable experience of harmonious coexistence of civilizations reflected in the historic center” of the region. The forum also marked 20 years since the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) classified the historic center of Macau as a World Heritage Site in 2005.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:02:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Carlos Morais José</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/carlos-mj/</link><description>Our approach to reality, no matter how disciplined and honest the approach to thought, is always ridden by error, especially when there is no alternative to the use of imagination. Geniuses, the ancient Greeks knew about the Earth's sphericity and that's why they attributed a maximum circle to the planet, which they named Ison. Today we call it Ecuador. However, these Hellene geographers considered these regions to be unreachable and uninhabitable.
Torrid Zone: there, unbearable heat would boil the oceans, preventing the passage to temperate zones, postulated further south of this line that marked the maximum circle of the sphere.
A simple islet, named “das Rolas”, a mere hundred meters from the island of São Tomé, in the Gulf of Guinea, is crossed by this equatorial line. This location of the former Portuguese colony provides it with a type of climate that is only found with such intensity close to the equator: the temperature varies little and, contrary to what the Greeks thought, it does not reach excessive values. Its range is between 20 and 29 degrees Celsius, but the “normal” temperature remains between 23 and 25 degrees. Night, day and throughout the year.
In the permanently cloudy sky, the Sun and Moon are rarely seen. And when this happens, they never fail to appear wrapped in veils of clouds, which gives them an unreal character, invoking ancient magic, witnessing moving skies.
When, towards the end of the afternoon, the rain extends its reign for more than two or three hours, often presented to plants and animals by a thunderstorm, the light dies and a very dark night reigns over the land and sea. The stars fall beyond the clouds that cover everything. On a night like this, there is no moonlight to illuminate or pierce the clouds. A deep pitch falls on the earth, a darkness that is impenetrable to our eyes. And it was like that, at three in the morning, that I woke up. My eyes opened to an abysmal darkness. Nothing, absolutely nothing could be seen. He knew he had the window open, but not a ray of light deigned to enter the room. I reached out, but the lamp didn't work. The electricity was out again. I waited for some time, hoping to get used to the blackness and discover some shapes in it. In vain. He was immersed in a well of black, warm water, he could feel the humidity on his skin, which had just woken up sweaty from a nightmare. I decided to get up and leave the house, looking for some light.
The rain had stopped. Outside, the forest celebrated, hummed, reverberated with sounds. There would be millions of insects, amphibians, vertebrates, all of them nocturnal animals, also immersed in the dark, where they found food, sex and salvation. Life didn't need light. It was heard, deafening.
At the edge of that spontaneous excess of trees and plants, nothing could be seen either. Dark, impenetrable dark. Only the sound prevailed, louder and louder, and suggested movements among the trees. That mixture of buzzing, squealing, buzzing, ringing, rales, loudly surrounded my ears, building a helmet that blocked all other senses, including the one that affects me in space. I was dizzy. And in that half-daziness, I groped my way back to the house, to my bed.
There was nothing he could do. Forget the coffee, eliminate the possibility of reading or consulting a computer. Lying in the dark as if waking up in a coffin.
Our mind cannot handle fear for long. Mostly irrational. As was the case. I can't really talk about fear, fear, but about discomfort, derived from the fragile situation that I attributed to myself. Everything could happen in that dark, and I wouldn't see him. If for some reason you had to leave the room, where would you go, if everything was plunged into darkness? But nothing was happening in the darkness of my room, nor would anything happen that would force me to grope through the pitch black, looking for a light. On the contrary, in that bed I was protected by the dark and if I saw nothing nothing would see me either. This thought provided some comfort. All things considered, that abysmal pitch was strangely comfortable for me. I made it a protective cloak and not a space of threats. And so I remained.
The ancient Chinese say that everyone has an excellent place to stay. A place where you can develop and enjoy who you really are. Maybe this dark package is mine. Perhaps in it I can be for myself what I really am, setting aside what surrounds me, instructs and distracts me. I am undoubtedly alone. Without the possibility of communicating with another person or even acting in my surroundings. I'm left. With me. Alone. Isolated. Here I am not the anthropologist, nor the editor, none of my social titles perform any functions. I am not the husband, the friend or the lover. From the outside I only have the language that inhabits me and my brain rebels in search of meaning. And even this takes second place in daydreams whose material seems to emerge from another place, from knowledge not conditioned to a language — an impression of the world and not its explanation.
I am a consciousness separated from things, which in the dark finds its most intimate relationship with the universe, of almost dissolution, a chamazita, a fiery being, whose interior insists on shining in the dark night. The universe and me. I'm unique. Nothing can divide me without destroying me. I know I am an individual, because I feel it deeply, with an almost painful acuity, even though neurologists tell me about the Self as an evolutionary fiction, structuralists see me as a product of Culture, psychoanalysts as a Family and Marxists as History.

The Taoist philosophy of the beginnings, that of Laozi and the Book of Way and Virtue (《道德经/經》), will choose the water of the ocean and the sea as the privileged image of the Tao (道 Dào), that which cannot be said, without form, on which the universe itself and the ten thousand beings (万物 wânwù) that inhabit it depend, as well as the first principles of existence, the void (無/无 wú), the masculine yang (陽/阳 yáng) and the feminine yin (阴/隂yīn).
This choice of an indigenous Chinese philosophy finds its echo in popular language and philosophy, for example in expressions such as “enormous capacity” (海量Hǎiliàng), which can have both an affective and social interpretation of portentous generosity or magnanimity, as well as a physical and concrete one, applying to someone who can ingest large quantities of alcohol. The sea is also linked to the word good and constant, for example in the “oath of eternal love as energetic as the sea and firm as the mountain”, where mountain lends added firmness to the promise (海誓山盟 or 山盟海誓Hǎishì-Shānméng or Shānméng-Hǎishì).
The ocean, the sea, but also the great rivers are made up of generous water, both in popular and erudite Taoist philosophy.  Here water is the figurative model of the Tao, as read in the Book of Way and Virtue and in the best sinology, which is why we recommend additional reading of Alan Watts Tao: The Watercourse Way.
It is worth paying special attention to the chapters in which water appears as the closest representation of the Tao in the Book of Way and Virtue, namely: chapters 8, 14, 34, 66 and 78.
In chapter 8 we are informed that the Tao is the supreme good “like water” (上善如水) (Abreu, 2014, 43), but it is not water itself. Therefore, it will be due to the similarity of functions that both are compared. Now water is generous, granting life to all beings, without establishing any distinction between them, its gift reaches even those that no one likes and I am thinking, for example, of parasites. It remains close to the earth to fertilize it, it is deep, simple, true, fair and correct and very timely, when it washes and cleans at the right time.
This is also the case with the Tao.  In the first verses of chapter XIV, regarding the Tao, an aquatic image appears again:
 
You look and you don't see,
It's called Indistinct.
You listen and you don't hear,
It's called Silent.
Touch and don't get caught,
It's called Subtle.
This trio is not decipherable
For it merges into a unity
2 (Ribeiro, 2004, 32-33)
And a little later we are told that he is nameless and uninterrupted (繩繩不可名) (Ibidem)
The Tao is like an ocean, an uninterrupted and inexhaustible unity in which someone easily imagines themselves swimming in water that is neither too bright nor too dark, as would happen to Michael Saso in his 14th meditation on the Tao, in A Taoist Cookbook. with Meditations from the Laozi DaodeJing, which he called “Nadar no Tao” (Saso, 1994,47), a meditation that he accompanied by a recipe for spinach, soy paste and sesame, since the wise man is the one who “empties the mind and fills the belly” (虛其心實其復) (Ribeiro, 2004, 10-11), here one feels how the author is immersed in the great Tao, following with the current.
Water can also be represented in a large river, as in chapter 34:
The great Tao floods like a river,
To the left, to the right,
Ten thousand beings depend on him.
（大道泛兮/其可左右/万物恃之而生）
(Abreu, 2013, 94-95)
In the same chapter we are told that the Tao not only gives life but nourishes and feeds, being an essential shelter in the return to the origins, not for death, but for eternal life diluted in the great unity, being therefore great, as big as the sea, or rather the great sea, which is the ocean.
Whoever wants to be as it should be in existence or even correctly govern the world, must follow the model of the water in rivers and seas, as we read in chapter 66:
Rivers and seas are greater than a hundred valleys
Because they remain below them,
and so they are princes, dominating waterfalls and streams.
(江海所以能为百谷王者/以其善下之/故能为百故王)3
(Abreu,2013, 158-159)
The wise man's behavior is distinguished by its malleability and spontaneity. He does not impose himself, which is why he is respected by everyone, only he should then govern, because he acts naturally, without oppressing, without hurting, letting everyone follow their course as freely as possible, as is reiterated in chapter 78:
Nothing in the world is more malleable and flexible
as for water,
but in attacking what is hard and rigid
nothing can surpass it
and there is nothing to replace it.
(天下莫柔弱於水/而攻堅強者莫之能先)
(Ribeiro, 2004 160-161)
Laozi's Taoist water is among the Five Chinese Elements (Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal) the one that evokes great oceanic unity, source of life for everything that exists, but also of death, or rather, of return to origins and eternal life, when this image represents the philosophical principle Tao. And if water, fresh and salty, is the supreme good of the world, the Tao is the origin, the supreme good, including of Heaven. As a root or mysterious female (chap 6) it is the root of the cosmos as we know and experience it. He is a source of spiritual and material life, but so is water, since his model must be followed in all circumstances, from the material source of beings to complex human conduct. People who act correctly, and especially Taoist sages and saints, are aware of the physical and concrete model of water that helps them practice another invisible one, that of Tao.  They will then be malleable and adaptable, capable of nourishing themselves from the inside and giving life to any form on the outside. You will know how to transform yourself to better nourish and vivify.
The Taoist oceanic model differs from the one that inspired the Portuguese throughout history, who looked to the sea as their ocean. Taoist water is not challenging nor does it call for conquest, it does not have cables of storm or hope to bend, it does not require weapons or boats, nor maps, nor nautical instruments. It is the dominant, conquering element within all beings, who will adapt to this most malleable element, without needing to develop their inventive spirit. The philosophy it leads to does not ask for vigilance or a critical spirit, but adaptation to the world as it is and generosity to accept it with a minimum of suffering and a maximum of joy.

Four years ago, in 2021, James inherited more than 300 pieces of antiques from his elderly father. The family heritage dates back to the Song dynasty (10th-13th centuries) and the collection includes exquisite jade items, porcelain, bronze wares, incense burners and high-value jewelry from various periods. During the turbulent war years, these treasures were buried in a hole in the backyard for decades. Now, through their interdisciplinary curatorial project, they are about to enter a dynamic dialogue with the worlds of fashion, art and sport.
Joy: How did you feel when you received the family inheritance?
I was completely surprised! My brothers and I had no idea that our family had such things. We were ignorant about our family history.
Joy: Tell me about your family history.
James: Our original surname was Zhao and we belonged to the imperial family of the Song dynasty. Our roots are in the heart of Chinese civilization. Chinese history has been complicated and turbulent, and my family has failed to preserve the details of our specific ups and downs. All I know is that in 1931, to escape the Japanese occupation, my grandmother took my father and other family members and together they walked to Chongqing in the south. My father was still a boy. To survive and take better care of her son and family, my grandmother decided to remarry into a local clan called the Xing. The Xing family accepted the proposal, as long as my grandmother paid them 300 taels of silver, a significant amount in wartime China. That's how we changed our imperial surname Zhao to Xing. After remarrying, my grandmother asked my father to dig a hole in the yard. That's where the family heirloom was stored, until my father decided to pass it on to me. My father didn't want to divide the collection between my brothers, as he knew I was the only one who could appreciate its true value. To repay my father's appreciation for me, I immediately gave my private collection a name: Jade Ambience, 琼华幸境 in Chinese.
Joy: Why that name?
James: I feel like I've always been lucky in life, like I've always been protected by some supernatural force with which I could cure strange illnesses and save people. You know, I love helping people and I can't stand seeing sadness and injustice in the world. Since he was a child, he saved lives during the annual floods of the Yangtze River in Chongqing. I didn't fear for my own life, because I knew I was protected. Will it be a gift? I would like to believe so. I even abandoned my career as a successful businessman and decided I wanted to be a soldier, so I could actually contribute to my country instead of earning a lot of money. I even turned down an opportunity to go to the USA and run a company there. That was in 1989. My experiences in the army made me stronger, both physically and mentally. I value life's experiences because they make me understand the human world better and give me positive energy to appreciate each day. In some inexplicable way, I attribute all of this to the jade items in my collection (laughs).
JOy: In fact, Chinese people believe that jade stone radiates positive energy. Since ancient times, jade has been associated with protective power, healing power and immortality. What is the true value of your collection, in your opinion?
As I said, jade has a very special place in Chinese culture. Jade symbolizes moral integrity and virtue, which is the stone's central symbolic value.
Confucianism inextricably linked jade to the ideal of the “exemplary person” (junzi 君子), who should embody the virtues reflected in the physical qualities of jade, including benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, courage (“It is better to be a broken jade than an intact tile”) and purity.
Jade served as a material expression of authority and was made into ritual objects used to communicate with divine forces and symbolized imperial power—most notably through the legendary Imperial Seal made of jade. For ordinary Chinese people, jade offers protection and good luck and has long been considered a talisman against evil forces. Jade carvings also carry auspicious meanings: bats for blessings, peaches for longevity, and fish for abundance. In ancient belief systems, jade was believed to preserve the body and soul after death. This concept found its ultimate expression in the jade burial suits of the Han dynasty, intricately assembled from thousands of pieces of jade to ensure immortality. Jade was also seen as the essence of the cosmos—a fusion of the vital energies of heaven and earth. The Chinese language is rich in jade-related expressions that convey admiration and virtue! Therefore, jade items are timeless symbols of love, symbolizing lasting and sincere affection. Today, jade remains a precious heirloom, a solid investment, and a powerful emblem of cultural identity — connecting contemporary Chinese to our heritage. In this way, jade contains old and new life! Jade is not just a precious stone full of vitality. It is a cultural landmark — a bridge between old China and new China.
Joy: What do you want to do with your collection?
James: Right now, I'm planning to organize a traveling exhibition in Beijing, Shanghai and maybe Macau. As I said before, jade is full of vitality. Jade is a bridge between ancient China and modern China. So I don't want to limit my collection to the usual antique circles. I'm thinking about doing cross exhibitions with fashion, art and sport. I want jade to have a lively dialogue with contemporary, young and modern Chinese audiences!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Australia | Twelve killed in attack during Jewish festival</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/australia-doze-mortos-em-ataque-durante-festa-judaica/</link><description>At least twelve people died and many injured were transported to Sydney hospitals yesterday, after a shooting attack on the Australian beach of Bondi, while a Jewish celebration was taking place. “There are two people in police custody on Bondi beach”, reported the New South Wales State Police on its X account, which asks “the public to avoid the area”.
Citing police sources, the AFP news agency reports that the attack caused ten deaths. The New South Wales ambulance service confirmed to ABC television that at least 16 people were transported to six hospital centers in the region.
Several witnesses report that it was a shooting attack carried out by an as yet undetermined number of armed people, but the authorities have not confirmed this information either. A British tourist told French news agency AFP that he saw “two gunmen dressed in black and armed with semi-automatic rifles”.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has already issued a statement lamenting the “shocking and distressing scenes” coming from Bondi and confirmed the existence of injuries.
Part of the beach was the scene of a celebration of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, which began yesterday and, although Australian authorities have not yet made any connection with the incident, the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog, denounced what he classified as a “vile terrorist attack against the Jews who were lighting the first candles” of the religious festival.
"Our heart is with them. The heart of the entire nation of Israel beats strong at this precise moment, as we pray for the recovery of the injured, we pray for them and we pray for those who lost their lives," he said in an official statement.</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 02:14:32</pubDate></item><item><title>Crime | Government does not release data on suicides and attempts</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/15/crime-governo-nao-divulga-dados-sobre-suicidios-e-tentativas/</link><description>After the Health Services, the Security department also stopped publishing data on suicides and attempts, after ten years of publication. The absence was noted in the release of crime data for the months of January to September this year, which show the increase in sexual abuse of minors to almost double
 
The Government stopped publishing data on suicide cases in Macau, as well as attempts. The absence of these numbers was noted by the newspaper Cheng Pou when it released crime data for the months of January and September this year on Friday.
The publication even questions whether “the data on suicide has become ‘the secret that cannot be said’ of the authorities, committed to building a happy Macau”, remembering that this data began to be released in 2015. Highlight is the fact that the Health Services also stopped publishing the statistics, something that was done every three months. In the case of the Security Secretariat, the data was monthly and was broken down by sex, age group and methods used.
The lack of numbers comes after Macau broke records in terms of suicide cases in 2024, registering 90 deaths, 2.27 percent more than in 2023. Compared to 2022, the increase was 12.5 percent. Of the 90 cases, 48 ​​concerned male victims and 42 female victims, aged between 12 and 76 years. The most recent data, for the first half of this year, reveals 41 deaths by suicide and 101 attempts.
In the release of crime statistics, on Friday, only one case of death by suicide appears in relation to an episode of homicide between brothers, which occurred in August this year, in the north zone. Here, the older brother jumped from the balcony, being suspected of having killed his younger brother due to financial disputes.
Break in crime
Looking at the crime panorama in general terms, there is a drop of 7.1 percent in the months under analysis, compared to the same period last year. The territory's authorities highlighted the sharp drop in computer crimes. The Secretary for Security, Chan Tsz King, said that the drop is due to the “decreasing trend” of “crimes that attract more attention from society”, including serious violent crime, theft, robbery, fraud and computer crimes.
In the first nine months of the year, 187 violent crimes were recorded, which represents a drop of 11 percent compared to the same period in 2024 (210). Thefts, robberies and frauds fell by 7.7, 5.9 and 23.6 percent, respectively. Computer crime, which recorded 770 cases in the first nine months of 2024, showed a decline of 52.1 percent in the period under analysis, with 369 cases.
The decline in cases of fraud using telecommunications, cyber fraud and computer fraud, said Chan Tsz King, “reflects the effectiveness of the prevention and combat work carried out by the police, and the significant increase in public awareness about fraud prevention”, he said.
The Government also highlighted that crime related to illicit gambling increased by 985 percent between January and September this year, with 394 more cases compared to the same period in 2024. The increase is due to the entry into force, in October last year, of the law to combat illicit gambling crimes, which introduced “the new crime of ‘exploitation of illicit exchange for gambling’ and expanded the scope of coverage of some crimes related to illicit gambling”.
For the same reason, said the secretary, gambling-related crimes soared in the first three quarters of 2025 – 1,737 cases, 70.1 percent more than in the same period last year. In the past, the official said, fraud committed by people illegally exchanging money outside casinos “could not be identified as related to gambling”. “However, with the criminalization of ‘illegal money exchange’ and the improvement of legal provisions”, these cases “are now included in gambling crime statistics, thus increasing the number of crimes”, he indicated.
More abuse of minors
Chan Tsz King, who took office in October and presented the crime report for the first time on Friday, also referred to a 6.1 percent increase in crimes against the person, with child sexual abuse increasing by 86.7 percent, from 15 cases in the first nine months of 2024 to 28 cases in the same period this year.
The secretary explained that these are essentially “voluntary sexual acts between people of the same age”, with “transmission of photographs and pornographic images”, without forgetting cases of “less serious sexual harassment”.
“Cases involving people with family relationships were also identified, which deserves the attention of society”, said Chan Tsz King, who released data on awareness-raising actions on this problem: more than 70 activities carried out by the police, which saw the participation of more than 12,000 people, including students, guardians and teaching staff.
Drug trafficking and sale and drug consumption, in turn, registered an increase of 37.1 percent, with 13 more cases, and 72.7 percent, eight more cases, respectively. According to the secretary's presentation, the 48 cases registered in the three quarters and the respective increase are due to “the discovery of several cases of cross-border drug trafficking through the reinforcement of internal and external police cooperation”, highlighting a case that occurred in September, when 31 kilos of cannabis flower worth 31.77 million patacas were seized. Chan Tsz King said that this was “the biggest case of cannabis smuggling seized in the history of Macau”.
Between walls
In the case of the crime of rape, there was a decline in the number of rape crimes, to a total of 24 cases, 40 percent less than in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretary for Security added that “more than 70 percent of the victims were not residents of Macau”, and “the majority of these crimes occurred in hotel rooms”, while “a number of these involved pecuniary conflicts between the victims and the suspects, and it is not possible to rule out the hypothesis that some of the cases occurred in the context of a sexual transaction”.
In this context, the secretary clarified that the police authorities have been “in close communication with the hotel sector”, and “police devices and inspections in peripheral areas of hotels and casinos” have been reinforced. Between January and September, more than 160 police actions were carried out to combat prostitution, with 192 people suspected of engaging in prostitution activity being intercepted.
Furthermore, during the period in question, 17 cases of pimping or exploitation of prostitution were resolved, with the arrest of 26 suspects.
Silence as always
Questioned by Lusa during the press conference about the first case to be investigated in Macau within the scope of national security, the secretary made no comments. “The case (…) is being handled by judicial entities and, due to secrecy, it would not be appropriate for the Secretary of Security to comment”, added Chan Tsz King, who was a Public Prosecutor when former deputy Au Kam San was detained.
At the end of July, the territory's police announced the arrest of Au Kam San, the first under the state security defense law, which came into force in 2009, with the scope being expanded 14 years later. The accusation is not yet known and there is no information about who will defend the former deputy.

“The co-legislators agreed on a target of a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, compared to 1990 levels, with the aim of achieving climate neutrality in the EU by 2050”, is announced in a statement released in Brussels.
After several hours of negotiations, the European Parliament and the Council thus reached, this morning, a provisional political agreement (which will have to be confirmed by both) on an amendment to the EU Climate Law, establishing a new intermediate and binding target for 2040, that of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent compared to 1990 levels.
Even so, MEPs and countries agreed to introduce new forms of flexibility to meet the 2040 target, “believing that the green transition and European competitiveness must advance hand in hand”, according to the note.
Under review
Specifically, from 2036 onwards, up to five percentage points of emissions reductions (two more than the Commission's initial proposal) could come from high-quality international carbon credits, compatible with the Paris Agreement. In the case of Portugal, for example, this means that sustainable projects in countries such as Portuguese-speaking African Countries (PALOP) can count towards the Portuguese target.
“Thanks to Parliament's insistence, additional safeguards were integrated, including the prohibition of financing projects in partner countries that contradict the Union's strategic interests”, highlights the European assembly. It is up to the European Commission to analyze different options for the role of international credits in future EU climate legislation to reach the 2040 target.
Furthermore, the community executive will assess progress every two years, taking into account the most recent scientific data, technological advances and the EU's international competitiveness.
"The review will analyze the situation of net removals at European level, comparing it with what is necessary to meet the 2040 target, as well as possible implementation difficulties and the potential to strengthen the EU's industrial competitiveness. Trends in energy prices and their impacts on companies and families will also be considered", according to the European Parliament.
This will allow Brussels to modify the 2040 target or take additional measures to strengthen the support framework, for example to protect the EU's competitiveness, prosperity and social stability.
Parliament will now vote on the informal agreement and the Council will also have to approve it, with the text coming into force 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. The European Climate Law makes each country's effort to reduce its polluting emissions legally binding.</description><pubDate>2025-12-11 04:37:47</pubDate></item><item><title>UCM | White Paper suggests methods to accelerate economic diversification</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/ucm-livro-branco-sugere-metodos-para-acelerar-diversificacao-economica/</link><description>The “White Paper on Scientific and Technological Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries”, produced at the City University of Macau, refers to inequalities in the relationship between countries and concludes that “economic diversification has advanced at a slow pace”. Bárbara Morais, main writer of the document, explains the main conclusions of the analysis
On December 3rd, a White Paper was launched that provides a look and analysis of the way in which cooperation in scientific and technological areas between China, Macau and Portuguese-speaking countries has been taking place, outlining some criticisms, not only on this topic, but also on the economic direction that the Macao SAR is taking.
The document, entitled “White Paper on Scientific and Technological Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries”, was produced by the City University of Macau (UCM) and had Bárbara Morais, a doctoral student at the institution, as main writer.
In an interview with HM, she describes that, in Macau, “economic diversification has advanced at a slower pace than desired, keeping the economy structurally dependent on gambling and tourism”.
"The central message of the White Paper is clear: Macau needs to accelerate the transition to functions with greater added value. However, the current context offers a renewed window of opportunity. With the support of the Greater Bay Area and, very specifically, the Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin, Macau now has new structural opportunities to recover lost momentum and reposition itself, not just as a cultural bridge, but as a true platform for innovation", he said.
Still on the territory, but in relation to Forum Macau, the “success in institutionalizing political dialogue” is mentioned, but the White Paper “points the finger at the insufficiency of execution mechanisms”. “To streamline the role of the Forum and transform it into a tool for tangible results, the White Paper advocates a paradigm shift: it is necessary to move from declarations of intent to technicality”, describes Bárbara Morais. The doctoral student suggests “the creation of specialized technical working groups, especially in the technological sphere, and the rigorous definition of performance indicators, such as the number of registered patents, startups created or joint research projects”.
“At the same time, it is suggested to establish a common agenda focused on areas of the future, such as green energy, health, the maritime economy and artificial intelligence, subject to a periodic assessment of progress”, he also said.
The place of arbitration
Taking these meager developments into account, the White Paper suggests that Macau assert itself “as a center for technological arbitration and intellectual property governance”.
HM questioned Bárbara Morais about what should be done in effective terms, taking into account the existence, for several years, of an arbitration center, and the fact that it has been a topic on the territory's political agenda for a long time. The doctoral student highlights that “in order for these ideas, debated for years, to stop being rhetoric and become reality, the Macao SAR needs to create a legal framework specialized in technological disputes aligned with the most demanding international standards”.
"It is essential to attract international experts and arbitrators through competitive incentives and establish an arbitration center that enjoys recognition both in Portuguese-speaking countries and in the Greater Bay Area. The objective is to develop mediation, certification and management services for intellectual property assets, positioning Macau as a 'safe haven', neutral and efficient, for the resolution of international technological disputes", he added.
Unequal cooperation
In global terms, and with regard to cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries (PLP), the White Paper refers to “top planning” by Beijing for cooperation in universities and scientific research. However, planning “does not translate, linearly, into equally effective execution mechanisms on the ground, nor does it guarantee homogeneous results among the nine Portuguese-speaking countries”.
Planning implies “clear guidelines, defined priorities and diplomatic instruments mobilized to guide this cooperation”, with policies such as “Made in China 2025” or the “Digital Silk Road”, which “integrate technological cooperation with the PLP into the very core of Chinese foreign policy and national innovation”, highlights the author.
However, there are “inequalities, which are perhaps the most striking feature of this relationship”, as Bárbara Morais explains. “The current scenario reveals a profound asymmetry, characterized by a ‘bicephaly’ in cooperation. (…) The main scientific capabilities, the robust technological infrastructure and the volume of effective cooperation are overwhelmingly concentrated in Portugal and Brazil”. On the contrary, “Portuguese-speaking African countries (PALOP) and Timor-Leste have a significantly lower participation”.
According to Bárbara Morais, the “disparity does not arise from a lack of political will, but rather from structural funding limitations, a shortage of qualified human resources and the fragility of local research institutions”. Thus, there is “two-speed cooperation, very asymmetrical within the Portuguese-speaking community itself”.
The White Paper highlights the “historic crossroads” in relation to cooperation between China and the PLP, which means “the urgent need to move from potential to implementation” in this matter.
"There are ambitious visions and strategic plans, but practical results remain below what is possible. To resolve this crossroads, the proposed path involves strengthening execution mechanisms, investing massively in talent and technical-scientific education, creating ecosystems of genuine collaborative innovation between China, Macau and the PLP, and, above all, having the courage to measure results and reformulate strategies based on empirical evidence, abandoning the discourse of circumstance in favor of economic and scientific pragmatism."
Gaps in Africa
Another of the conclusions of the White Paper is the “tenuity” of academic links with the African continent, which Bárbara Morais describes as a “fragile scenario”. “There is a triad of factors: the scarcity of installed scientific capacity, the chronic lack of funding and consistent mobility programs”, without forgetting “the absence of stable joint research structures”.
“To bridge this gap and create a lasting critical mass, the White Paper is not limited to diagnosis, suggesting concrete measures such as the robust reinforcement of research grants, the creation of joint doctoral programs, the implementation of collaborative laboratories and the design of academic mobility mechanisms specifically oriented to the African reality”, he adds.
The document also talks about the negative impact of “geopolitical asymmetries”, such as the “technological restrictions of the European Union and NATO on Portugal”. According to Bárbara Morais, “real and restrictive impacts” are at stake. "These limitations condition the participation of Portugal and, by extension, of other Portuguese-speaking actors that cooperate in a network with Lisbon, in high-technology projects that involve China. The impact is particularly sensitive in critical areas such as 5G telecommunications, defense, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, creating barriers that require complex diplomatic navigation."
New strategies
The White Paper was developed at the UCM Research Institute on Portuguese-Speaking Countries, and written by Bárbara Morais with the participation of academic João Simões. The project is based on a review of academic literature on the topic and also on the results of the “Technological Cooperation Launch Seminar”, held on July 22, 2025 at UCM.
The work analyzes areas such as “strategic evolution”, “institutional mechanisms”, “technological milestones” and “structural challenges”, aiming to “provide evidence-based strategies to transform the potential of the China-PLP partnership into a concrete reality, creating a new model of technological cooperation for the Global South”, says a statement from UCM.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 00:53:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Europe | Merz considers aspects of Trump's geostrategy unacceptable</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/10/europa-merz-considera-inaceitaveis-pontos-da-geostrategia-de-trump/</link><description>The head of the German federal government, Friedrich Merz, declared yesterday that there are certain unacceptable points in the document on Defense and geostrategy of the North American Administration led by Donald Trump, from a European perspective. “I don’t see any need for Americans to want to save Democracy in Europe,” he said, on a visit to Rhineland-Palatinate (a southwestern state), which is home to several United States of America (USA) military bases.
In a strategic document on US national security, released last week, there is a warning about the danger of “civilizational extinction” in Europe if “current trends” continue.
Trump, in the preface, summarizes: “we put America first in everything we do”. “It is more than plausible that, in a few decades at most, the members of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) will become predominantly non-European”, he wrote, adding that “it is legitimate to question whether they will perceive their place in the World or their alliance with the USA, in the same way as those who signed the organization's charter”.
The White House regrets European decisions that “undermine political freedom and sovereignty, the migration policies that are transforming the continent [Europe] and creating tensions, as well as the censorship of freedom of expression and the repression of political opposition, the drop in birth rates and the loss of national identities (…)”.
Washington expresses the desire for “Europe to remain European, regain its civilizational self-confidence and abandon its fruitless obsession with regulatory suffocation.”</description><pubDate>2025-12-10 03:31:29</pubDate></item><item><title>East Timor | Memories of a man's life reflect the resistance of a people</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/09/timor-leste-recordacoes-da-vida-de-um-homem-reflectem-a-resistencia-de-um-povo/</link><description>The book “Return to Uaidora, the childhood and youth of Domingos Gusmão” recounts the Timorese's testimonies about the years of Timor-Leste's resistance to the Indonesian occupation. The testimony was written in Macau by former resident and university professor Duarte Trigueiros. 50 years after the occupation, the author reminded HM of the work launched in 2022
This year has been marked by the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the independence of many former Portuguese colonies. Timor-Leste went to one of these territories. However, shortly after the unilateral proclamation of independence, on November 28, 1975, there was a period of confrontation that culminated in the Indonesian occupation, on December 7 of the same year.
This Sunday marks 50 years since the invasion that marked the fate of the young country. In connection with this date, the book “Regresso a Uaidora, the childhood and youth of Domingos Gusmão” was released in 2022, which reveals the story of the Timorese, who was a student in Macau and a student of the author Duarte Trigueiros, former economist and professor at the University of São José. HM spoke to the author about the reflection of the pain and struggle for self-determination of a people that can be seen in the life of a man and his family.
"When I was teaching in Macau, I collected the testimony of this Timorese from Baucau. Domingos Gusmão, knowing that he had taught at the National University of Timor-Leste for several years, told me how he and his family lived through all these terrible events."
This is how the book was born, with Trigueiros merely reporting the testimony, later corrected in partnership with Domingos Gusmão. The work only has an online version, but at the time of launch it had the support of Fundação Oriente in printing some copies. Matebian, East Timor
Duarte Trigueiros, who lived in Macau for several years, came into contact with Domingos Gusmão during the Festa da Lusofonia, in 2015. "I went to the Timor-Leste tent and he told me that he had interesting things to tell me, but that he couldn't speak Portuguese well, and that he would like to leave his testimony in writing. At one point I proposed asking him questions from his childhood, about life in the village, and thus the book was born, with nine chapters.”
The beginning of the work describes, “through the eyes of a child, the day-to-day life of farmers in the Baucau mountains in Timor-Leste, the determination in which they reacted to the invasion of their country in 1975 and the brutal repression that followed”. "The book follows not only his life, but also his family and the few who remained. In the end, there was practically no one left", describes Duarte Trigueiros.
According to the work, Domingos Gusmão was born on November 1, 1969 in the village of Uaidora, belonging to the municipality of Baucau, the son of Julião, a farmer, and Juliana, a maid. "But only the place where I was born is correct. The date of birth is nothing more than a conjecture and the names that appear on the certificate as being my parents, Julião and Juliana, are also not those of my real father and mother, but of relatives who adopted me when I was an orphan. In fact, I am the son of Martinho Gusmão, whose code name was 'Maunoco' and he was the chief of the Uaidora village until his death in 1983; and my mother was Ricardina, Martinho Gusmão’s second wife, the one who gave him offspring.” This is how Domingos’ story begins.
Going to Baucau
The work recounts very difficult years, with thousands of Timorese fleeing into the bush to escape the Indonesians, organizing armed struggle. One of the chapters, highlights Duarte Trigueiros, reports how Domingos and his family "were deported and left without any type of support, without doctors or food. "A huge number of people died at that time, until the beginning of the 80s, and they [Dominicos Gusmão's family], already in the place where they were cultivating the land, began to have fruits from the land, and send children to school. This boy [Domingos Gusmão], during that time, started preparing to go to Baucau to study, something that was not easy, as it was necessary to find a place, and there were many children.” Domingos and Xanana Gusmão
It was there that the family decided to leave the village and go to Baucau, finding jobs “at the service of the troops, judges, nurses and doctors”, which gave them their first contacts with the Timorese resistance.
"He [Domingos Gusmão] began organizing what they called a clandestine front with his colleagues. The book reports all these adventures that clearly reveal how the resistance worked. This boy then felt the desire to continue his studies and applied to a Catholic seminary", recalled Duarte Trigueiros.
The connection to the Catholic religion was not an accident. "The purpose was to go abroad, because the only thing that Indonesians really respected was the Catholic Church, they didn't respect anything else. And he left, spent a number of years training. He was in the Philippines, where he also participated in resistance activities, and returned as a priest, in 2012."
Writing this book was important to Domingos Gusmão because he “wanted to mention the names of the [Timorese] commanders of the first phase, when the Indonesian troops entered through Baucau, towards the interior, and there were a large number of resistance commanders who resisted, almost without weapons, and were killed”. “When he spoke to me about this subject, he was very insistent, he told me ‘Write down the name of that commander.’ Everything so that the names would not be forgotten”, he recalled.
"What he told me is that nowadays, in Timor-Leste, people are compensating the members of the resistance who are alive, but there are many dead who gave their lives for this and are being forgotten. But this book also talks about everything on a personal level, about what happened to the uncle, how the father died at that stage, thrown to the ground, with a gun butt, with kicks, because he refused to accept an order and they threw him to the ground. He was the head of the village and had to accept the order [of the Indonesians], but he refused”, highlighted Duarte Trigueiros.
For the author, the work tells “a truer version” of what the Indonesian occupation was, and very specifically about the experiences of the town of Uaidora and the interior of the country.
In the book, you can read Domingos' testimony about this phase of resistance in Baucau, starting in 1986. “I owe my enlistment in the resistance to the clandestine fronts and also to my colleague Domingos de Oliveira. (…) A few weeks later, on the 16th or 17th of September 1991, the centenary of the Dili cathedral was celebrated and young people were invited to participate. 14 left from Baucau. Buses full of teenagers and I was one of them. The next day, during the return trip, FRETILIN flags appeared and we all sang hymns to independence.
As we passed through Manatuto, the troops ordered us to stop, but then they told us to continue; and at the entrance to Baucau, before the airport, the road was blocked and we were surrounded by a strong military device. There were only three assault cars!”
Gusmão continues his account of this tense moment. "After having cornered us like this, the troops, with the assault vehicles on the right side, occupied the left side. The 14 trucks were lined up with the military device, which had its weapons in position, ready to fire. They were like a very long firing squad. There we stayed, with all those weapons pointed at us, in silence while time passed and nothing happened."
Support from Portuguese
Duarte Trigueiros and Domingos Gusmão kept in touch, but a stroke took away the Timorese's quality of life. "He hardly responds to my emails. Maybe he has a different outlook on life", confesses the author.
Another perspective that the work gives, according to Trigueiros, is the position of the Portuguese authorities during the years of Indonesian occupation, dispelling the idea that there was abandonment after independence. "I simply show what Domingos told me, and he told me that many of the resistance commanders had been Portuguese soldiers and that, therefore, they knew how to use weapons. He also told me that they were extremely patriotic. There is a report that in the 90s they tried to get a satellite phone from Portugal to give to the resistance, and there are references to the support of the Portuguese Embassy in Manila. I think we looked good in the photograph", he concludes.
Duarte Trigueiros taught in Timor between 2004 and 2009, where he found higher education very weak. "The students practically didn't know Portuguese and we had to teach in Portuguese. That alone was a huge effort. In general, the students were weak, they were very poorly prepared. The [educational] preparation of the Indonesians had been of a low level, as there was discrimination against students for being Timorese. The book describes this, how only good students had the right to move up, so to speak, and that didn't even mean going to university."
Even so, Duarte Trigueiros highlights the training of “a good number of people, engineers, law graduates, economists”. “It took a lot of work and that was the great support that Portugal was able to give”, he added.
Today, the former economist says that the Timorese look at the Portuguese with immense gratitude. "It's amazing, because when we go on a street with an Australian, they despise the Australian and don't talk to him, but with the Portuguese they shower him with all kinds of affection. This happens a lot in Timor-Leste", he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-12-09 02:47:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Evolution | African genomes point to the origins of the human species</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/evolucao-genomas-africanos-apontam-origens-da-especie-humana/</link><description>Homo sapiens has existed for at least 300,000 years, but its exact origin remains unknown and a new study has ruled out the hypothesis that it evolved in East Africa and expanded south. The study, based on the analysis of ancient genomes of people who lived from the Stone Age – 10,200 years ago – to 150 years ago in southern Africa, argues that a group of individuals lived in partial isolation for several hundred thousand years.
By analyzing their genomes, researchers found genetic adaptations that likely shaped H. sapiens as a species. Details of the study – the most comprehensive to date on ancient African DNA – conducted by researchers from Uppsala University (Sweden) and the University of Johannesburg, were published on Wednesday in the magazine “Nature”, reported the agency Efe.
“We have long known that Southern Africa was inhabited (…). We can now demonstrate that Homo sapiens existed and evolved in Southern Africa over a long period and that this region played a significant role in human evolution, perhaps the most important of all”, highlighted Mattias Jakobsson, geneticist at Uppsala University and main author of the study.
The team analyzed the ancient genomes of 28 individuals from southern Africa and compared them with those of their contemporaries from other parts of the world. They discovered that the Stone Age inhabitants of southern Africa lived in isolation for a long period.
“This group appears to have remained genetically isolated for at least 200,000 years, and it was only around 1,400 years ago that clear traces of genetic flow within this group began to emerge, when DNA from individuals from East and West Africa began to appear in individuals from Southern Africa,” explained Jakobsson.
Although no new groups migrated to southern Africa until about 1,400 years ago, genetic data suggests that members of the southern population migrated north during certain climatic periods. In fact, genetic material — dating back to around 8,000 years ago — from this southern population has been found in individuals from present-day Malawi, making it possible that southern migrations also occurred earlier.
Techniques and variations
A large part of the human remains analyzed were found in the Matjes River Rock Shelter (South Africa), an archaeological site with remains dating back approximately 10,000 to 1,500 years. This site also revealed different tools from each historical period, made with different techniques.
However, the individuals are genetically practically identical throughout the entire period, that is, there is no evidence of immigration or population exchange, “exactly the opposite of what happened in Europe, where cultural changes tend to coincide with population migrations”, analyzed Jakobsson.
In the study, researchers identified 79 DNA variants unique to Homo sapiens, distinct from those found in Neanderthals, Denisovans, chimpanzees and gorillas. Seven of these variants, related to kidney function, were “clearly overrepresented”.
The authors believe that these variants are linked to the unique human ability to cool the body through sweat, which requires a good ability to regulate the body's water balance. They also found variants involved in the immune system and neuronal growth. More than 40 percent of these variants are associated with neurons and brain growth, suggesting a role in cognitive evolution.
Additionally, several genes have been linked to attention, a mental ability that may have evolved differently in Homo sapiens compared to Neanderthals and Denisovans.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:56:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Light Rail | Qingmao will be a hub for several lines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/metro-ligeiro-qingmao-vai-ser-centro-de-ligacao-de-varias-linhas/</link><description>The Qingmao Light Metro station will be added to connect different lines, meaning that the cost of the works has risen to MOP7.59 billion, compared to MOP3.04 billion originally.
According to the Chinese channel Rádio Macau, the information is contained in the report on the Budgetary Execution of the Administration's Development Investment and Expenditure Plan (PIDDA), in which the East Line extension project appears with a new name.
The new name identifies the station as the connection point between the Eastern Line and the Citizens' Sports Garden on the Old Canídrome Lot.
The name change was identified in the Legislative Assembly, within the scope of the work of the Monitoring Committee for Public Finance Affairs, led by deputy Song Pek Kei. According to the president of the commission, who cited explanations from the Government, the number of stations will be increased from one to two, which combined with the costs of works, materials and systems to be installed, will increase the cost to 7.59 billion patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:01:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Administration | Wong Sio Chak inaugurates Sónia Chan and Lo Pin Heng</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/administracao-wong-sio-chak-da-posse-a-sonia-chan-e-lo-pin-heng/</link><description>The Secretary for Administration and Justice, Wong Sio Chak, presided yesterday morning at the inauguration ceremony of the new Director of Identification Services (DSI), Sónia Chan, and the new Director of the Legal and Judiciary Training Center, Lo Pin Heng.

Patriotism is the main priority of the Federation of Workers' Associations of Macau (FAOM) for the coming years. The guarantee was left by Lam Lon Wai, who on Tuesday was elected as the new president of the board, after the first ordinary meeting of the FAOM board.
Speaking to the newspaper Ou Mun, Lam Lon Wai stated that he will continue to promote the association's “glorious tradition of love for the country and Macau”, uniting workers in supporting the governance of the Macao SAR, in accordance with the laws in force.  The president of the association also pointed out that he will focus on improving FAOM's services, in order to contribute to the “practice of the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle”, while increasing the “attraction, cohesion and service capacity” that the association provides.
In relation to the remaining members of the association, at a lower hierarchical level compared to Lam Lon Wai, Kong Ioi Fai was elected president of the association's administration. Although he is not a deputy, Kong was the representative of the FAOM list, the Union for Development, in the last legislative elections held on September 14th.
Regarding the goals for this mandate, Kong Ioi Fai indicated that the objectives include defending labor rights, increasing participation in governance, bridging the gap between the population and the Government, and also promoting a more harmonious society. The association also promises to work to implement new unions, in light of the new law.
Patriotism in companies
Kong Ioi Fai also revealed that the association will focus on promoting patriotism in the labor sector, hoping to create a strong patriotic culture in companies. This commitment involves developing manuals and content for workers on patriotism.
The official also revealed that the association will continue to organize professional skills competitions and award activities, to highlight employees considered to be excellent in different areas.
At the same time, the new management will organize more classes on artificial intelligence and cross-border e-commerce, to train the qualified staff needed for Macau's economic diversification. Kong Ioi Fai also highlighted that FAOM will explore Zone A of the New Urban Landfills and provide more social support.
In relation to the remaining positions of the new FAOM board, the president of the previous board, Ho Sut Heng, was elected as president of the Supervisory Board. Some of the most popular members of recent years are retained in the new leadership, such as current deputies Ella Lei, Leong Sun Iok, Leong Pou U and former deputies Lei Chan U and Lee Chong Cheng. The new management will take office on January 20th.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 00:57:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Government | Secretaries committed to complying with Xi’s instructions</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/governo-secretarios-empenhados-em-cumprir-orientacoes-de-xi/</link><description>In the aftermath of the assessment of a year of governance presented by Sam Hou Fai in Beijing, the holders of the main public positions promised their commitment to articulating with the 15th five-year plan. Furthermore, they committed to guiding the course of Macau's development through the “important instructions” given by Xi Jinping
The entire government team, and other holders of the main positions such as the Commissioner against Corruption, or the MSAR Prosecutor, issued statements yesterday demonstrating their commitment to complying with the guidelines given by President Xi Jinping during the presentation of the balance sheet of the first year of governance of the Executive led by Sam Hou Fai in Beijing.
Even before arriving in Macau yesterday afternoon, the Chief Executive “expressed his sincere gratitude to the President for the full recognition of the work of the MSAR government, as well as for the valuable guidance and important instructions”. Sam Hou Fai stressed that the Government will “seriously” study and understand the guidelines given by Xi Jinping, “as well as firmly implement them” in next year’s Lines of Government Action.
It is recalled that Xi Jinping indicated that Sam Hou Fai led the new Government of the Macao SAR in resolute advancement and pragmatic action, in the firm defense of the country's sovereignty, security and development interests, “fully recognizing the work carried out by the Chief Executive and the Government of the Macao SAR”. The Chinese President stressed that governance must be linked to the 15th Five-Year Plan, “insisting and improving the predominance of Executive power, solidly promoting the development of adequate diversification of the economy, constantly increasing the efficiency of governance and better integrating the national development situation and serving it”.
Widespread enthusiasm
The reactions of all secretaries followed in a succession of statements. The Secretary for Administration and Justice, Wong Sio Chak, “stated that the important instructions given by President Xi Jinping guided Macau's development path”, and that all his staff are “very enthusiastic” and committed to implementing the guidelines.
Like all secretaries, Wong Sio Chak guaranteed that “the Administration and Justice area will act proactively in conjunction with the country's 15th Five-Year Plan”, and continue to deepen the reform of public administration, promote electronic governance and improve the functioning of public services.
The Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture stated that Xi Jinping's “important guidelines” reinforced confidence and were a “great stimulus for the team” under her supervision. Lam added that the President's instructions “are far-sighted, presenting a strong political, ideological, strategic and guiding dimension”, which will be taken as a “guide for action”.
In the same vein, the Secretary for Transport and Public Works stated that the 15th National Five-Year Plan systematically outlines a grand project for national development over the next five years”. Raymond Tam Vai Man highlighted the provisions on optimizing the regional economic layout and the Greater Bay Area, which “provide fundamental guidance for work in the area of Transport and Public Works”. transport infrastructures and expanded urban space through landfills and urban renewal.
Guardians of the country
The Secretary for Economy and Finance, Anton Tai Kin Ip, also stated that he will implement President Xi Jinping's important guidelines. Furthermore, he guaranteed that “the functions of ‘a center, a platform, a base’ will be consolidated, taking advantage of Macau’s unique advantage as a ‘precision interlocutor’ between China and Portuguese-speaking countries to promote cooperation with these countries”. The secretary added that his authority is committed to expanding international exchanges, “well narrating the Macau chapter of the Stories of China”.
In turn, the Secretary for Security committed to “firmly safeguarding the sovereignty, security and development interests of the State, defining the direction under the leadership of the 15th Five-Year Plan, preparing for adversities in prosperous times”.
The intensification of prevention and reduction of the effects of natural disasters was also highlighted by Chan Tsz King, who committed to acting “by contributing to the construction of a strong country and to the great cause of national rejuvenation with Chinese-style modernization”.
Another priority advanced by Chan Tsz King was the facilitation of border crossings, with particular focus on the connection between Macau and Hengqin.
The director-general of the Customs Services (SA), Adriano Marques Ho, assured that, “as guardians of national security”, he will “unswervingly implement the requirements of the “general perspective of national security”, combating “severely” all activities that threaten national security. The official added that the SA is “burdened with the heavy responsibility of safeguarding the economic order of the Macao SAR.”
The Commissioner against Corruption, Ao Ieong Seong, chose to highlight that the 15th Five-Year Plan requires lucidity and firmness in the fight against corruption and abuses of power.
Upon arrival
During the presentation to Xi Jinping of the balance of his governance, Sam Hou Fai realized the great importance and concern that the Chinese President and the Central Government attach to the development of Macau, said the Chief Executive upon arrival in the Macao SAR, still at the airport. The local official reiterated his “sincere thanks” for Beijing’s support and assured that he will unite and lead all sectors of society to study, implement and fully execute Xi Jinping’s “important” speeches and instructions, according to the Chinese channel Radio Macau.
Sam Hou Fai also stated that the guidelines indicated by the Chinese President will guide the planning of the Executive's key tasks for next year and beyond. According to the Chief Executive, the Chinese leader called for improvements in the legal system and law enforcement mechanisms to safeguard national security.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 00:56:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Mental health | New Youth calls for investment in pets</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/saude-mental-nova-juventude-pede-aposta-em-animais-de-estimacao/</link><description>The New Chinese Youth Association of Macau advocates investing in the “pet economy” as a way of dealing with young people’s mental problems and encouraging the development of open-air markets. The position was taken yesterday, after the presentation of a study by the association on the development of Macau's markets, cited by the newspaper Ou Mun.
The study was based on 644 surveys, with people aged between 18 and 44, and concluded that 56.1 percent believe that the current model of development of traditional markets is the most correct. Furthermore, around 71.1 percent of respondents believe that more local brands focused on outdoor markets should be created, driven and promoted by young entrepreneurs.
In view of the conclusions, the association represented by Kuok Meng Chit, vice-president, defended the Government's greater focus on measures to promote the "pet economy in local open-air markets. This investment is also seen as a way of promoting the mental health of younger people. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, Macau has been dealing with an increase in suicide attempts and suicides, with a major impact on younger people, which has led the authorities to stop publishing statistics.
As part of the “pet economy”, the association asked for more space in open-air markets for canines and felines and also services such as animal-themed spaces and the possibility of renting carts to walk animals.
With these ideas in mind, the association believes that “a high-quality social environment where people and pets coexist” will be created and that the “pet economy will be a new driving force for the development of Macau’s market economy”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-17 01:19:04</pubDate></item><item><title>Traffic | UMTEC pays 9.22 million to Chongqin experts</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/transito-umtec-paga-922-milhoes-a-especialistas-de-chongqin/</link><description>The research company controlled by the University of Macau once again used the services of the Chongqing City Traffic Planning Study Institute and the Chongqing Sustainable Development of Resources and Economy Research Association within the scope of the General Planning of Traffic and Land Transport of Macau
UMTEC, a research company controlled by the University of Macau, will pay 9.22 million patacas to two institutions in Chongqin, as part of the work to review the General Planning of Traffic and Land Transport in Macau. Information about the review of the plan that is in force until 2030 was released through the portal of the Directorate of Public Supervision and Management Services (DSSGAP).
The works were awarded on December 9th and the Interior entities involved are the Chongqing City Traffic Planning Study Institute and the Chongqing Sustainable Development of Resources and Economy Research Association. These institutions were also involved in the creation of the plan, in 2022, which was subsequently subject to a public consultation.
The services provided by the two institutions to the University of Macau company include assisting in aspects such as analyzing transport models, evaluating the effectiveness of planning and formulating proposals for optimizing current infrastructure. The contract provides for the provision of services until March 2027, that is, a service lasting practically two years.
The amount paid by DSAT to UMTEC was not found yesterday, at closing time at HM, on the DSAL portal in the direct adjustments or awards area.
Expected review
The revision of Macau's General Traffic and Land Transport Planning had been planned since 2022, when the current plan came into force, at the time with the aim of developing a traffic infrastructure in the city to integrate Macau into the Greater Bay Area.
The review will involve measuring the evolution of some indicators of traffic and transport policies such as the rate of sharing of public transport, average speed of circulation during rush hours, degree of satisfaction in relation to public transport, emission of polluting gases by land transport, rate of road accidents or the annual growth rate of motor vehicles.
Also in 2030, when the final year of the plan's implementation is reached, a new evaluation is planned, which should also count on the contribution of the Chongqing City Traffic Planning Study Institute and the Chongqing Sustainable Development of Resources and Economy Research Association.
These two institutions were also involved in the initial work, although at that time the amount received for the work provided to UMTEC was never made public. The matter was addressed by deputy José Pereira Coutinho in a written questioning, at the end of 2022, with DSAT admitting that it was unaware of the amount paid. The only certainty in advance was the fact that UMTEC received 20 million patacas for the work.</description><pubDate>2025-12-17 01:17:55</pubDate></item><item><title>Tourism | Visitor forecast maintained at 39 million</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/turismo-previsao-de-visitantes-mantida-em-39-milhoes/</link><description>The director of Tourism Services, Helena de Senna Fernandes, yesterday reiterated the estimate that by the end of the year the territory should receive around 39 million tourists.

In the security sector, the world will face complex challenges. Terrorism could take on new forms, using digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Cybersecurity will become a priority, with digital attacks on critical systems posing significant risks. It is estimated that by 2030 the global costs of cyber attacks could exceed US$10 billion annually. On a military level, geopolitical tensions between the United States and China could intensify. The Middle East will continue to be a focus of instability. Between 2026 and 2030, social and cultural scenarios will assume a determining role in shaping the global future. International migration will continue to be one of the most striking phenomena, driven by armed conflicts, economic inequalities and climate change.
It is estimated that hundreds of millions of people may be in a situation of international or internal mobility, either in search of better living conditions or out of need for survival. Europe will face migratory pressures from Africa and the Middle East, with hundreds of thousands of people seeking refuge in countries such as Italy, Greece, Spain and Germany. This flow will require more robust integration policies, but it could also generate social and political tensions, fueling populist and nationalist discourses.
In the United States, immigration will continue to be a central issue, with restrictive policies causing social tensions and protests, but also with the need for labor in sectors such as agriculture, construction and services. In Latin America, internal migration will intensify due to extreme climatic phenomena, such as floods and droughts, forcing millions of people to move from rural areas to cities. In Africa, desertification and armed conflicts in the Sahel could displace more than 20 million people, creating large-scale humanitarian crises.
Urbanization will be another central phenomenon. By 2030, more than 65% of the world's population will live in urban areas, with megacities growing rapidly. Cities such as Lagos, Kinshasa, Mumbai, São Paulo and Jakarta could exceed 30 million inhabitants, facing challenges in infrastructure, housing, transport and sanitation. Accelerated urbanization will bring opportunities for economic and cultural dynamism, but also risks of inequality and social exclusion. Cities will need to invest in sustainable solutions, such as efficient public transport, affordable housing and waste management. The digitalization of cities, using smart technologies, can improve the quality of life, but will require inclusion policies to prevent vulnerable populations from being excluded.
Demographic transformations will be equally decisive. Population aging in Europe, Japan and South Korea will require health and long-term care policies, with an impact on pension systems and fiscal sustainability. It is estimated that, by 2030, more than 25% of Europe's population will be over 65 years old, creating productivity and financing challenges for social systems. In contrast, Africa and parts of Asia will have growing young populations, with millions of people entering the job market. This phenomenon could be an opportunity for economic dynamism, but also a risk of instability if sufficient jobs are not created. India, for example, will have more than 1.5 billion inhabitants in 2030, with a young population that could drive growth, but will require massive investments in education and training. China will face the challenge of an aging population, with more than 400 million people over the age of 60 in 2030, which could limit economic dynamism and increase pressure on healthcare and pension systems.
Cultural scenarios will also transform. Digital globalization will continue to spread cultural values ​​and practices, but also generate tensions between local traditions and external influences. Music, cinema and literature will circulate increasingly intensely, creating a hybrid global culture. However, movements asserting identity and valuing local cultures will gain strength, seeking to preserve traditions and resist cultural homogenization. Cultural diversity will be both a wealth and a challenge, requiring policies of inclusion and respect for difference.
Migration, urbanization and demographic transformations will interact with environmental and technological phenomena. Cities will have to adapt to extreme weather phenomena, such as floods and heat waves, which will affect millions of people. Climate migration will become a reality, with entire populations moving due to rising sea levels and desertification. Accelerated urbanization will require technological solutions, such as smart cities and sustainable infrastructure, but also social policies to ensure inclusion. Demographic transformations will create new balances of power, with Africa and Asia gaining demographic and economic weight, while Europe and Japan will face aging challenges.
In summary, the period between 2025 and 2030 can be described as a critical transition phase, in which the events of 2025 acted as catalysts for structural changes that manifested themselves in different dimensions. The global economy entered a cycle of moderate recovery, but with persistent risks. International politics was marked by polarization and geopolitical tensions, with the United States and China competing for technological and industrial leadership, and the Middle East remaining a focus of instability. The environment has revealed the urgency of the energy transition and climate adaptation, with extreme phenomena affecting millions of people. Technology has transformed economies and societies, creating opportunities and risks. Education and health required inclusive and innovative policies. Security has become a priority, with cyberattacks and digital terrorism posing significant risks. The social and cultural scenarios revealed the importance of migration, urbanization and demographic transformations.
The future will depend on the ability to articulate national interests with collective responsibilities, building a balance between competitiveness and solidarity. If countries are able to invest in responsible innovation, inclusive education and energy sustainability, it will be possible to build a fairer, sustainable and inclusive future. Otherwise, the risk of prolonged stagnation and worsening inequalities will remain high. The period between 2025 and 2030 will therefore remain a decisive moment, in which humanity was called to choose between cooperation and fragmentation, between the courage to move forward and the risk of remaining a prisoner of its own contradictions.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:18:06</pubDate></item><item><title>My mouth is a blackhead</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/a-minha-boca-e-um-cravo/</link><description>«… In your broken mouth, carnations grow, wither, leafless carnations in my chest»
It was 1968 and Adriano sang the prophecy. Adriano Correia de Oliveira, the most expressive player of our times whose brief life has not been forgotten by many. It was a modeling presence that offered us, his almost visionary voice only took shape years later when life did not contemplate much more merit for having been a song of full dawn, and left us left to the sting of the speculative interventionism of occasional voices. That's why in times of flower wars, he still sings, and enchants all those who in their present bring us a future.
Adriano is the name of the Emperor, and he also had that clear and imperturbable profile, serious and distinct, he knew how to look at him well, and it was on a clear April morning that he was born with the tone of Spring in the grace of a field of flowers; he was a jester, very different from a singer, he will forever be the most eloquent of song writers with something like a prophet and a lord full of discipline and nostalgia, those beings that do not exist, but exist forever in our imagination; This Adriano who tells us, following the song sung, that: «the heart only leaves its leaves if its roots rot/sad destiny of us, of the people of my country» But, “another carnation is the heart/ leafless in your chest” was a great interpreter of the song and a full herald of tomorrows.
All these people do not deserve flowers, which they give and contemplate in the initiatory cycle of promises, in the germinal conquests of love, in the powerful saps of tenderness and in the social cycles of great achievements, these people do not deserve flowers. Plucked from the earth. There are wars of Rosemary and Marjoram, a comedy of deceptions by António José da Silva in the eighteenth century, our “Jew”, but the vegetal interpretation will now give rise to carnival puns between roses and carnations, which is no different from the author's humorous purpose. Often the most ferocious beings opt for singular things of icy whiteness, fogs and white roses, they are exclusively purists in their approach to matter and in the reflections of the very clear ornamentations, but none of this corresponds to the glimpse of Supraconsciousness on the other side of the portal. They are like that because yes, but never sensitive or fraternal, red, loving and intense like the scarlet beings of generous affirmation.
Roses in winter, Dom Dinis had already suspected, but anyway, whoever plants pine forests, adds rose bushes to them, and miracles are always welcome, and even so, the most enlightened king let it pass as a sign of love, except that he would die in the middle of winter with doubts about his “pink green flowers” ​​but never apologizing to the superlative act of a royal belief. Unfortunately, we no longer have him among us to say about his lordship the strange things that happened to him, but let us never doubt his mouth like a nail broken into summer loves as red as his ardor. At that time we would have an intoxicating Hadrian and a king with recitatives and carnations in his mouth, and all the beauty that comes apart and begins again, in the kisses that we give only in the time of all the flowers.</description><pubDate>2025-12-17 01:37:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Campbell's Soup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/16/campbells-soup/</link><description>Robert Garza, a former cybersecurity analyst at Campbell's Soup, a well-known food brand sold in Macau and Hong Kong, filed a lawsuit in Michigan court, USA, claiming to have a recording of a meeting with Martin Bally, the company's vice president of information technology, held in November 2024, to discuss compensation.
In the recording, Bally is heard saying that Campbell's Soup food is "sold to the poor" and is "highly processed", also stating that the chicken in the soup is "3D printed" and that "he would never buy it." Robert Garza is using the recording as evidence in this lawsuit, accusing the company of unfairly firing him because he found his comments challenging. The case is currently under trial.
After checking the recording, Campbell’s Soup Company determined that these remarks were “vulgar, offensive and false,” and fired Bally last November and publicly apologized. Campbell's Soup is sold around the world and this incident, which occurred at the company's US headquarters, has significant implications.
We can comment in depth on this news from multiple perspectives, from employment to business, including the food industry and the public. Firstly, from an industrial relations point of view, a senior employee tells an intermediate employee that the product they sell is “poor man's food”, which affects the company's image. The mid-level employee's complaint, which resulted in dismissal, demonstrates that the company's complaints mechanism is ineffective.
Employees who complain put their jobs at risk. This form of management reduces employee loyalty, nullifies the company's long-term development potential and offers nothing positive. Ultimately, it forces employees to resign or report the situation to government entities or the press, escalating the conflict between the company and workers. The smooth functioning of companies depends on competent and loyal employees, they are their most important intangible asset, whatever the business area.
In this case, although Bally was fired, the company needs to rethink its complaints mechanism. For example, they could be addressed directly to the Board of Directors, which would restore employee confidence and help with more effective management. Consumers are not interested in an employee being fired, but they are interested in discussing whether the company uses “3D printed chicken” in its food.
Campbell’s Soup clarified that its chicken comes from traditional suppliers and is not “lab-grown” meat. "The label “bio-engineering” refers to the use of genetically modified technologies in some ingredients of plant origin, such as corn and soy. This is a common practice in the US food industry and is completely different from “cell-cultured meat”. To guarantee Campbell Soup's commercial reputation and product value, these clarifications must be accompanied by new sales and crisis management strategies. This involves reinforcing the company's long-term social responsibility, increasing the transparency of the production process and the acceptance of external inspections of ingredients to check for the presence of genetically modified components. All of this tests the decision-making ability and risk management ability of Campbell Soup management.
On the other hand, “3D printed chicken” has once again reawakened the public’s long-standing concerns about the modern food industry. Consumers are concerned about whether mass-produced food is excessively processed, whether the origin of the products is clear and also about the effects they may have on health. This incident has once again led consumers to discuss these issues.
The impact will be greater the greater consumers' concerns. Perhaps the company could consider hiring an external entity to conduct a survey to assess the level of consumer concern and then develop strategies to reduce it.
For American society, Campbell’s Soup, which provides convenient and affordable food, has long had the image of a “family friendly” and “comforting” brand. The statement “food for the poor” insults consumers. People on low incomes have limited financial resources and rely on processed foods, which raises the question of the relationship between mass-produced foods and low income levels. This reveals that Americans' food choices are closely related to their finances.
This phenomenon exposes the impotence of low-income Americans in choosing food and paints a embarrassing picture of a developed country.
What is at the heart of this issue is the fact that a top manager at Campbell minimized public confidence in the company's product, causing a rupture between internal statements and consumer confidence. It represents a situation in which the “brand myth was built in the kitchen but collapsed in the boardroom”, a question of business ethics and not product quality.
How this scandal will affect sales and the brand will depend on whether Campbell is able to successfully maintain its image as a familiar and comforting product, on consumers' memories, but also on their skepticism towards mass-produced foods, the actions of competitors, etc.
In addition to resolving the crisis in the domestic market, the dimension of confidence in foreign markets, as important commercial destinations for Campbell’s Soup, cannot be ignored. In the age of the internet, events that occur in one place cross the world in an instant. If Campbell’s Soup does not consider the reactions of foreign consumers, it will be carrying out inadequate crisis management.

The problem was wanting to go to the demonstration organized to protest against the absurd proposal of the Montenegro Government regarding a possible new Labor Law, a general strike that had not brought together the UGT and the CGTP for many years. The dilemma was precisely related to the general strike. The couple, residing in Amadora, did not have any transport to travel to the center of Lisbon. His best neighbor had also decided not to go to the demonstration because the Metropolitano was on full strike.
Thousands of workers were prevented from going to the demonstration due to lack of transport. Surrealism was in sight. The desire to protest, yes. Like, impossible. More surreal was the fact that the drivers of dozens of buses that the union centers rented to transport protesters had to work on a day of general strike, political Portugal is actually divided in half. On the one hand, conservatives and neo-fascists. On the other, the democratic and radical left.
A sad division for those who want a better country and a reduction in the number of Portuguese living on the edge of poverty. The union centrals announced that the general strike was resounding, the best ever and with an unusual turnout of around 80 percent. The strike paralyzed air, rail, road, sea and river transport, as well as schools, daycare centers, hospitals, health centers, homes for the elderly, day centers, courts, universities and museums.
The Montenegro Government came, with an air of contempt and arrogance for carrying out the general strike, to say that participation was low and that it would not have exceeded five percent. And his demagoguery prevailed when he “ordered” the television channels he controls to clearly show that at Autoeuropa there were a lot of workers not joining the general strike. The custom of numbers. For some, excellent. For others, a fiasco. The truth is that the general strike affected thousands of Portuguese people, in one way or another.
The most important thing wasn't even the general strike. What is at stake is the widespread protest, including by some former PSD and CDS leaders, against the absurd and harmful content of the government proposal for a new Labor Law. The concern that has grown the most in company surveys is the lack of workers, many areas of activity face serious difficulties with the lack of qualified personnel and limitations on the recruitment of foreign labor, putting the objectives of the PRR at risk.
In a context of labor shortages, real wages have grown in recent years above inflation, with emphasis on the construction sector, with appreciations above eight percent. Faced with this scenario, what did the Government decide in its ideological fury? Opening an incomprehensible social conflict around labor laws, which have already been profoundly revised several times this century.
Nothing has been noticed about the Government's negotiating openness regarding the main themes of its proposal. Obviously, after four months of the Government turning a blind eye, a general strike had to be organized. A setback in labor pacifism is that the Government intends to allow for the possibility of dismissal without due process or just cause in companies of up to 50 workers, with the exemption from reinstatement if the dismissal is considered illegal by the court, the possibility of hiring in outsourcing the day following the collective dismissal, with an individual time bank, with a fixed-term contract for life, with the possibility of professional reclassification with a salary reduction, with the obligation for the children's parents to work on the weekends or with the decriminalization of undeclared and paid work under the table.
These are some of the Government's “innovative” proposals, which at no time agreed to back down, but which in no way contribute to competitiveness, digital modernization and worker qualifications. After months of hypocrisy in dialogue and innocent lamentations about an “untimely” strike, Montenegro came to mix the threat about compliance with minimum services, and the terrible economic impact of the general strike. Simply nonsense with a wave of demagogy of promises about salaries that wouldn't even remind the unions of requests from Santa Claus...
Even Bagão Félix and Silva Peneda have already recognized the inopportunity and unbalanced nature of the reform of labor legislation. And these personalities are not trade unionists or socialists, much less attended protest demonstrations or participated in strikes.
The most surreal thing about all this is that the Government will hope that after having forgotten the general strike and after Christmas, it will be able to impose the crushing machine that will lead to Portuguese workers losing rights like they never dreamed of. All that remains is for the PSD/Chega alliance to announce that the democratic regime will also be the target of a labor reform…</description><pubDate>2025-12-15 02:10:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Ivo M. Ferreira presents new film about terrorist group FP-25</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/ivo-m-ferreira-apresenta-novo-filme-sobre-grupo-terrorista-fp-25/</link><description>It’s called “Global Project” and it’s the new film by Ivo M. Ferreira, a Portuguese director who previously lived in the territory. The presentation to the world of cinema is scheduled to take place at the Rotterdam International Film Festival, in January, which takes place in the Netherlands.
The feature film is part of the “Big Screen” competition, whose narrative is “anchored in the early 1980s, when Portugal was the scene of attacks and robberies perpetrated by the 25 de Abril Popular Forces (FP-25)”.
Ivo M. Ferreira's project, described by the festival as a political thriller “set in the turbulent years after the 'Carnation Revolution'”, features actors such as Jani Zhao, Rodrigo Tomás, José Pimentão, Gonçalo Waddington, Isac Graça, João Catarré, Ivo Canelas, Hugo Bentes, Isabél Zuaa, later giving rise to a series for RTP. According to the producer, the film “Projecto Global” will premiere in Portuguese cinemas on April 23rd of next year.
The story focuses on Lisbon in 1980, when Rosa, Jaime and their FP-25 comrades “slide into an armed spiral where morale unravels, loyalty falters and each step opens a deeper abyss”. “Apart from themselves and with the dreams of the past in ruins, they no longer recognize the country they are crossing, and even less the people they have become”, describes the synopsis.
Ivo M. Ferreira is also linked to the local cinema scene, having directed the feature film “Hotel Império” in Macau in 2016, starring Margarida Vila-Nova. His film, “Letters from War”, was also shown in Macau.
Salvador's debut
Another Portuguese film premiering at the Rotterdam film festival is “A Providência e a Guitarra”, by João Nicolau, having its world premiere here, outside of competition. This is a project that was born from a short story by writer Robert Louis Stevenson, and is performed by Pedro Inês, Clara Riedenstein, Isac Graça, Jenna Thiam, Américo Silva and musician Salvador Sobral.
Shot in the summer of 2024, the film is presented as “a dive into the hardships and delights of artistic life and an exploration of its consequences” on marital and social relationships, and marks Salvador Sobral's debut in cinema. “A Providência e a Guitarra” is produced by O Som e a Fúria.
In Rotterdam, the program for short and medium-length films will also include the short films “O”, by actress and director Francisca Alarcão, an experimental fiction about an aversion to navels, and “Computer”, by visual artist Alice dos Reis, which “intertwines history and fiction in a fun narrative about the female perspective and self-determination”, describes the festival. The 55th Rotterdam Film Festival will take place from January 29th to February 8th in the Netherlands.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:16:52</pubDate></item><item><title>Music | Mariza in Macau for New Year's concert</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/musica-mariza-em-macau-para-concerto-de-ano-novo/</link><description>As part of the 2025-2026 concert season, the concert between Portuguese fado singer Mariza and the Macau Orchestra is scheduled for the last day of the year, in the large auditorium of the Macau Cultural Center. Here is a unique opportunity to see, or revisit, one of the great names of Fado, in a mix with classical music
Fado singer Mariza will perform in Macau in a concert that marks the arrival of a new year. “Mariza, the Queen of Fado and the Macau Orchestra (OM)” is the name given to this concert that takes place in the large auditorium of the Macau Cultural Center (CCM) on December 31st, starting at 8pm.
According to a note from the Cultural Institute (IC), Mariza will perform, “with her deeply emotional voice, a selection of iconic fados, providing the public with a musical experience that transcends genres and spatial and temporal boundaries”. The fado singer is described “as one of the biggest international Fado stars, being recognized for her own musical style, which incorporates elements of soul, jazz and gospel”.
"With her powerful voice, she has moved audiences on the most prestigious stages in the world. In this concert, Mariza will present with OM a repertoire that combines traditional and contemporary fado, enriched by the rhythms of Mornas from Cape Verde, 'rhythm and blues' and sounds from Brazil, Spain and Mozambique", being "a celebration of fado with a personal and diverse style".
Mariza made her world debut in 1999, having since released several Fado albums, with sales exceeding one million copies worldwide, winning over legions of admirers. She was named Best European World Music Artist three times by BBC Radio 3. The albums “Terra” and “Mundo” earned her nominations for the Latin Grammy Awards, consolidating her status as a global star and her musical influence.
The concert will last approximately 1h30 without intermission, and tickets are already on sale, with prices ranging between 180 and 400 patacas.
New sounds on the way
After releasing “Mariza Canta Amália” in 2020, the artist has dedicated herself to the stage. But last year he released a new single, “Casa”, in 2024, a song from the new album, “Amor”. The fado singer also released the single “Desamor”, which is also part of this album, and in which Mariza collaborates with another musician very different from herself – GSON, from the band Wet Bed Gang, a Portuguese rap group.
Quoted by Blitz magazine, during the presentation of “Desamor”, Mariza said that “it would be unlikely that two musicians from completely different backgrounds would meet, but our backgrounds are on the other side of history”. GSON said that “the fact that we are from different poles is what makes the difference in what is being done here”.
About the new album, Mariza told the same publication that she was inspired by the various forms of love that exist. “Love of longing, mother's love, family love... love, for me, is not just physical, it goes far beyond that.”
Meanwhile, OM announced another musical initiative, planned to take place next year. This is the “Esperança do Futuro” concert, scheduled for May 16th, and whose recruitment program for young local musicians ended on December 12th.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:15:41</pubDate></item><item><title>FRC | Sales of images benefit Tai Po victims</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/frc-venda-de-imagens-revertem-para-vitimas-de-tai-po/</link><description>Another photography exhibition by Gonçalo Lobo Pinheiro opened yesterday, on view at the Fundação Rui Cunha (FRC) gallery until January 10th of next year. “What was, will never be again…” is the second volume of a photographic project already released as a book, and which is now getting a new edition. But the highlight is the fact that the proceeds from the sale of this material go to the victims of the fire in the Tai Po area, in Hong Kong.
According to a statement, Gonçalo Lobo Pinheiro explained that this second volume “continues to be a meeting between the past and the present”, revealing images of places in Macau that have been profoundly transformed by the force of time.
"As in the first book, for just over a year I collected old images of the territory, in black and white or sepia, in different formats. I acquired them at auctions, on the Internet, from individuals, in stores and even in Portugal. Some images were also lent to me", said the author, adding that in this last venture, there is a photograph taken in the 19th century, in the Protestant Cemetery.
For the photojournalist, “Macau has changed a lot in recent years”, and “old photographs attest to this”. "And now, what to do with them? If, on the one hand, it is still possible to recreate some scenarios, on the other hand, it is impossible to obtain contact points in other photographs, because things simply no longer exist in the territory. It is a difficult job. Everything has changed. Therefore, in the vast majority of cases, what was will never be again...", he further noted.
With a preface written by Portuguese writer and professor Henrique Levy, who lived in Macau in the 1980s, the book is designed by Carlos Canhita and endorsed by Ipsis Verbis, with 40 photographs spread over almost 80 pages. The sale price is 250 patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-12-17 01:38:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Docomomo | Documentary by José Maneiras records the architect's career</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/docomomo-documentario-de-jose-maneiras-regista-carreira-do-arquitecto/</link><description>It is simply called “Maneiras” and makes an audiovisual record of a unique work that not only marked a generation of architects but also left its mark on modernism in Macau. The documentary by António Sanmarful, produced by Docomomo in memory of José Maneiras, began to be thought about in 2018 and contains testimonies from him about what he designed
Deceased on November 24th, aged 90, José Maneiras, a Macanese architect, did much more than simply design buildings in a small territory full of particularities. He was also a figure with relevant civic participation.
But in order to leave an audiovisual record of his work as an architect, Docomomo Macau began thinking and planning, from 2018, the production of a documentary about José Maneiras' legacy, having invited local director António Sanmarful to do it. Maneiras did not live long enough to watch the documentary about himself, presented this Tuesday in the Stanley Ho auditorium, at the Consulate General of Portugal, but he left on record many testimonies about what he projected.
To HM, Rui Leão, president of Docomomo Macau, says he has worked closely with António Sanmarful on this project, based on the exhibition dedicated to José Maneiras presented in 2018 at the Lou Lim Ieoc garden.
"At that time we did a survey of his works. It was a simple exhibition, in which we intended to show all of this work built in Macau and understand its importance, and we realized that it was little studied. It made sense to leave the record because, in the case of Macau, due to the scale of the city and the lack of critical mass, the study of built works is practically non-existent."
Rui Leão has long dedicated himself to studying and looking at the modernist architecture created in Macau, of which José Maneiras was one of the authors. Therefore, he calls the territory “ungrateful”, due to this lack of self-analysis. “People are almost completely unaware of Macau's modernist architecture, and in that sense I think it's a very ungrateful place, because there is no culture that celebrates memory.”
Therefore, the importance of making this documentary was imperative, as there is no such “differentiation” between the good and bad things that are being done, as there is no cataloging and analysis. “It was with this perspective, and with a feeling of a certain sadness on the part of the architect Maneiras [that the documentary was made]”, said Rui Leão, adding that “because the work was so damaged, and it was not talked about, we realized that it was important to do something that had a more permanent character”.
Some bitterness
Graduated from the Porto School of Fine Arts, José Maneiras brought different ways of creating architecture to the territory. "The documentary is based on the filming of some of his works and his testimonies. We realized what an architect, newly arrived in Macau, and with training done in Portugal, saw as important in the works. There was, let's say, a modernist training and things that Maneiras brought [to the practice of architecture] in a very scientific way, and that had to do with the sun exposure [of the buildings]. This was more urgent in Macau, in relation to Portugal, as we are in a subtropical place."
One of the first projects was the São Francisco residential building, in front of the Clube Militar, highlighting Rui Leão Maneiras' concern with leaving a free space in conjunction with the historic building in front.
"He talks a little about this intervention in the documentary, and that in a way it safeguards the Military Club, by allowing there to be an unbuilt space in front [of the São Francisco building]. This has to do with the civic dimension that it also had, of being concerned about heritage. Then he was called to solve a problem that no one knew how to deal with, which was that confrontation with the Military Club."
José Maneiras “took care to rotate the tower so as not to occupy the front of the Military Club, creating a visual opening and a smaller block on the other side, so a small square was created there”, which constitutes “a notable civic concern”, argued Rui Leão.
The president of Docomomo also confessed some bitterness with which José Maneiras left, as he saw much of his work already damaged or without proper maintenance. In the case of the São Francisco building, it could be the target of demolition or construction, and “he was quite unhappy with that”.
“I don't really know what the situation is like, but I spoke to José Maneiras about the possibility that the lower blocks of this building were about to be demolished, and he was very sad about it”, added Rui Leão.
Even so, “there are other buildings of his that have been restored, such as the residences next to the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário”, or the residence for blind people in the Areia Preta area.
Design with little
José Maneiras began to project in Macau during the years of Portuguese administration, when the Estado Novo regime was in force in Portugal and the territory was subject, like the remaining overseas territories, to Development Plans for budgetary issues. Money was, therefore, little and controlled.
“In the documentary he also talks about things that were important at the time, such as starting to build at height, which was new, and also the construction economy, because in the 50s and 60s there wasn't much money and there was a much greater need to make this construction economy.”
José Maneiras belonged to the list of Macanese architects who left their mark, such as Canavarro Nolasco da Silva and Aureliano Guterres Jorge, despite their basic training being in engineering; or even José Lei.
"They were people integrated into society in a completely different way [in relation to those who came from outside], and who understood the issues, being closer to the client, sharing the world and ways of creating. I'm not saying that, theoretically, the architecture of one and the other was stylistically different, but I'm talking about the fact that they made proposals and asked different questions", concluded Rui Leão.</description><pubDate>2025-12-17 01:36:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Commerce | Mannings closes all stores in the Interior</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/comercio-mannings-fecha-todas-as-lojas-no-interior/</link><description>On Tuesday, the Mannings Group announced the closure of all physical stores in the Interior as well as the online store and electronic platforms Tmall, JD and Pinduoduo. The closure of physical stores will take place on January 15th.
In the case of online stores, the deactivation will take place next week. The closures were explained with the need to adjust the commercial strategy.
Despite these closures, customers in the Interior will be able to continue purchasing products through the group's Hong Kong portal. According to company data, Mannings has more than 320 stores in Hong Kong and Macau. Since 2004, the group entered the Interior market, and the number of stores reached 200 units, during the period with the highest demand.

In annual terms, November saw a 20.4 percent reduction in the number of transactions and a 10.9 percent reduction in the average price per square meter
In November, the number of housing transactions showed an annual reduction of 20.4 percent, according to the most recent data published by the Directorate of Financial Services (DSF). Last month, 238 transactions were registered, compared to 299 transactions in November 2024, a reduction of 61 transactions.
The most active market in November this year was the Macau Peninsula with 173 transactions, 35 fewer than last year, which represented a drop of 16.8 percent. In Taipa, 44 housing sales were registered, 24 fewer than last year, when 68 were registered. Finally, in Coloane, 21 transactions were registered, a reduction of two sales compared to the same period last year.
In terms of housing prices, the month of November was marked by a reduction in the square meter, compared to the same month in 2024, from 74,364 patacas to 69,311 patacas. This represented an annual difference of 5,053 patacas or 6.8 percent.
The price reduction was common to all three markets. In Coloane, the average price per square meter fell from 93,970 patacas to 83,707 patacas, a difference of 10.9 percent. In the Peninsula and Taipa prices also showed a negative trend. In Macau, the square meter depreciated in the space of one year from 70,526 patacas to 66,303 patacas, a difference of 6.0 percent. In Taipa, the reduction was from 78,144 patacas to 71,155 patacas, an annual devaluation of 8.9 percent.
Double negative
The monthly comparison also shows a market shrinking in terms of the number of transactions and prices charged. Between October and November this year, the average price per square meter decreased by 4.9 percent, from 72,873 patacas per square meter to 69,311 patacas per square meter.
The price reduction was due to the Peninsula market, with a decrease from 72,629 patacas to 66,303 patacas, corresponding to 8.7 percent, and Coloane, with a reduction in prices from 87,535 patacas to 83,707 patacas, corresponding to 4.4 percent. In Taipa, the square meter appreciated by 11.5 percent in the space of one month from 63,802 patacas to 71,155 patacas, contrary to the general trend.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:05:46</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau Initiative | Manifesto defends investment in technology</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/iniciativa-de-macau-manifesto-defende-aposta-na-tecnologia/</link><description>The International Forum for Civilizational Exchange ended yesterday with the release of the 'Macau Initiative' of a manifesto that calls on young people to take advantage of technology in the service of dialogue and cooperation between civilizations. At the closing ceremony, the president of the Macau Cultural Institute, which organized the forum, read the document, which “encourages young people to take advantage of new technologies, such as digitalization and smart applications”.
Leong Wai Man stated that it is necessary to train new generations “so that they become heirs and innovators of mutual learning between civilizations” and build a world that is “inclusive, cooperative and forward-looking”. The manifesto also defends the need to not only protect the shared heritage of humanity, but also to reinforce “the innovative use of the various forms of tangible and intangible cultural heritage”.
The document calls for “deep exploration of the contemporary value of the historical cultures of all countries”, using “creative transformation” to apply “traditional wisdom” in the modern world. Macau is the ideal place for this initiative, says the manifesto, due to the “valuable experience of harmonious coexistence of civilizations reflected in the historic center” of the region. The forum also marked 20 years since the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) classified the historic center of Macau as a World Heritage Site in 2005.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:02:25</pubDate></item><item><title>SJM | Green light for the acquisition of L’Arc casino</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/sjm-luz-verde-a-aquisicao-do-casino-larc/</link><description>The Government yesterday approved the deal that will “save” the only satellite casino in the territory, giving the green light to the acquisition of Royal Arc by SJM Resorts. The approval, which comes two days after the group's shareholders voted in favor, required opinions from several public services
It's official. The L’Arc casino is part of the portfolio of properties operated by the gaming concessionaire SJM Resorts. The Government gave the green light to the deal yesterday through an order from the Secretary for Transport and Public Works, Raymond Tam Vai Man, published in the Official Bulletin.
The approval allows gaming to operate, beyond December 31, 2025, at the only satellite casino in the territory to survive the changes that regulate the casino industry.
Therefore, the order from the Secretary for Transport and Public Works indicates that “the transfer of the concession was authorized, in accordance with what was proposed in the opinion of the Land Commission”, after the request to transfer the fraction where the casino and hotel is located was presented on November 11th.
In the request, SJM claimed that the “transmission aims to maintain the continuous exploration and operation of the casino existing in that autonomous fraction, which operates as a satellite casino, transforming it into a casino belonging to the gaming concessionaire”. In addition to the positive opinion of the Land Commission, after a meeting on December 4th, the transfer received approval from several public services.
“After gathering the opinions of the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Directorate and the Tourism Services Directorate, the request was assessed by the Land and Urban Construction Services Directorate, which ruled in favor as there were no outstanding prizes, fees, rents, fees or taxes relating to the concession and there was no evidence that the transfer was requested for speculative purposes”, is stated in the order from Raymond Tam Vai Man.
Step by step
The building where the casino is located has “62 floors, including two refuge floors, two mezzanine floors and three basement floors, intended for housing, commerce, a 5-star hotel, residential parking and hotel parking”.
It is recalled that SJM Holdings held an extraordinary general meeting on Monday where shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the acquisition of the former satellite casino L’Arc, according to a note sent by the group to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The acquisition, approved by 99.93 percent, will cost HK$1.75 billion.
Nine of Macau's 11 “satellite casinos” have already closed. The last to close its doors, on December 9th, was Fortuna, with more than 550 employees. The tenth, Landmark, which has 1,169 workers, will close on December 30th.
SJM highlighted that all employees of the 'satellite casinos' with resident status in Macau and directly hired by the company have guaranteed employment in other casinos in the group. As for other local workers, “they are invited to apply for related vacancies” within the group, “with priority for hiring” and with conditions equal to those they had.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:00:12</pubDate></item><item><title>Football | Sporting wants to support Hengqin in training</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/futebol-sporting-quer-apoiar-hengqin-na-formacao/</link><description>The Lisbon club's intention was expressed after a visit to Europe by the Executive Committee of the Deep Cooperation Zone between Guangdong and Macau in Hengqin
Sporting Clube de Portugal showed interest in collaborating with Hengqin, next to Macau, in training young footballers, said authorities in the Chinese special economic zone. According to a statement released on Monday night, a delegation from the Executive Committee of the Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone in Hengqin was in Europe at the beginning of the month.
In Portugal, the delegation visited Sporting Clube de Portugal, described as “a powerhouse of European football”, and “investigated the youth training system” of the Cristiano Ronaldo Academy. According to the statement, the Portuguese club “expressed its availability to introduce a high-level youth football training system” on Ilha da Montanha.
In April, the Macau Government said it wants to hire a European team to provide football training to younger people, in a bid to develop this sport in the territory. “This year, we are going to try to expand football training for young people, we are going to try to hire a team from Europe to train young people”, said the then president of the region's Sports Institute, in the Legislative Assembly.
Without providing details about this European team, Luís Gomes also said that other football events are about to be launched: “young people from cities in the Greater Bay Area will be invited to play” in Macau and a “Hengqin-Macau cup will be created to promote sport among young people”.
A lot to recover
The Macau men's team, made up of amateur players, is currently ranked 193rd in the FIFA world rankings, made up of 210 teams. Among Portuguese-speaking countries or regions, only Timor-Leste is behind Macau, in 198th.
The Macau football team has not won a game since June 2019, at the time as part of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup. The local team beat Sri Lanka 1-0, in the first qualifying leg. However, the association withdrew from the second game, because the directors were afraid to visit Sri Lanka, following the occurrence of terrorist attacks. Since then the team has played 12 games, with 11 defeats and one draw.
In March, deputy Eddie Wu Chou Kit defended cooperation with the Portuguese Professional Football League (LPFP) to organize friendly games with “top European teams” in Macau.
In an intervention in parliament, Eddie Wu proposed “establishing [a] deep cooperation” with the LPFP to create, “together, a permanent training base”. The deputy explained that the objective would be “to attract top teams from Europe to train and hold traveling games, promoting sporting and cultural exchange at an international level”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Economic Association | Expected GDP growth of 5.4%</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/associacao-economica-previsto-crescimento-de-54-do-pib/</link><description>Macau's annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2025 is expected to reach 5.4 percent compared to the previous year, according to a report published on Monday by the Macau Economic Association.
The local association's forecast is 0.8 percentage points above Fitch Ratings' projection, which revised downwards its estimates of GDP growth from 6.9 percent this year, to 4.6 percent.
Regarding next year, the association's report points to “numerous uncertainties and unpredictable elements in the world economy”. However, Macau's economy will remain “stable” and with good growth prospects, thanks to macroeconomic factors such as the recovery in Mainland China and the efforts of the Government and the tourism industry to boost regional and international tourism markets. The economic prosperity index over the next three months is also expected to remain stable, according to the estimate, with a slight increase between January and February.</description><pubDate>2025-12-17 01:25:53</pubDate></item><item><title>SJM | Acquisition of L’Arc casino approved</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/sjm-aprovada-aquisicao-do-casino-larc/</link><description>Gaming concessionaire SJM Holdings held an extraordinary general meeting on Monday where shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of the acquisition of the former satellite casino L'Arc, according to a note sent by the group to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

A Ukrainian pensioner, with the same name as the president, blames Zelensky for the prolongation of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the villager, who never left his land, is now mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, a villager, represents half the world that recriminates the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters our house, covers his wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on the rapes in Ukraine, in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say to him: hi there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: you still haven't said what name you want to give the children!
A peace that is not dignified is nothing more than a cessation of rights. As serious as the Russophobia that Putin inflicts on his people.

At a lunch with several guests, I heard a friend, who declared herself a spiritualist, explaining the particularities of her belief, in a calm and balanced way, I would even say, without a hint of “irrationalism”. He spoke at length and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytism. “Here is someone whose belief has brought thoughtfulness!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at a certain moment a sentence comes out that horrifies me. It says, “there is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, and I glimpse the voracious maws of holism. Because holism has a pathological aspect, like all good things, a shadow side.
Two examples: in Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is just an expression of rigorous karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts he committed in his previous life. In Africa, it is not accepted that death could have been accidental, and many women are accused by the family of the deceased of having caused the death of their husband, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, a huge injustice for the wife — madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism introduced Compassion and Christianity introduced Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a Platonic stage, where we are nothing more than the shadows of something — an inextricable law -, in a determinism that calcifies all singularities, but that strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity was anchored in the conquest of chance and randomness, removing the incidences of a life from this fierce determinism that enclosed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at that moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and its volition were able to emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “there is no such thing as chance, nothing happens by chance!”, which should function as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, however, this phrase is usually used to seek a reason for things outside of us, in others. It's an alibi.
Today there is a holistic temptation in the world, just as there was a satanic temptation in the Middle Ages, without much reflection on its consequences. Because it's not enough to want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even for the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to that cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the fight” took place at the beginning of this century. One of the great mistakes of the 20th century was the false dichotomy between “rationalism and irrationalism”, a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality (the positive side of reason) was confused with rationalism (the pathological aspect of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment, irrationalism was confused with freedom. Almost all 20th century art, with Surrealism at its head, made this mistake. The fallacy still exists despite the emergence of “irrationalism” and the consequent relativist currents that followed it having been consolidated everywhere. Essentially, much of what happened in the 20th century revolved around this clash between two paradigms: Rationalism versus Irationalism.
Now, I see, we must save indeterminacy, chance, randomness from the terrible temptation of the cage of causalities. Holism, in its pathological form, may be reductionism that sets itself up as a new “eschatological narrative”.
Is it “by chance” that holism emerges at a time when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person is besieging everything, all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic awareness has brought a positive impact to greater ecological awareness, but followed with scholastic rigor, it stifles reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than uncomfortable: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that each moment asks of us — but how many will make the distinction, under a Law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will abandon themselves to what is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic awareness, as the Greeks knew, but it also brings agency and the courage of decision. And we cannot give up on this.
Furthermore, as Drummond shows in the poem “Quadrilha”, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade:
«João loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who didn't love anyone./ João went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of a disaster, Maria stayed with her aunt,/ Joaquim committed suicide and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story.»
Real always runs outside the track, completely outside our concepts. That's what matters to us — a J. Pinto Fernandes emerges at the exact moment when we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>From Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
When reading many people's reactions when this year's Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, I couldn't help but remember this comment from Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: «An editor of a large national daily newspaper wrote five lines of indignation at the fact that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been awarded to Thomas Traströmer, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did it not occur to this literary columnist, patented and paid to do his job, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of professional misconduct? Tranströmer had been translated into many languages, it was available in French.»
There is always the chorus of those who wait for the Prize to be announced to complain about not having been invited to be on the jury, there is a subgroup of angry people who profess “I have never read it and I won’t even bother to read it”; It is a less than humble fauna, the one that inhabits social networks.
I don't always know all the winners – I didn't know about the existence of Louise Glück, who I think is a great poet, or Olga Tokarczuk, for example – but this only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows everyone else and the joy of recognizing that the measure of the world is not measured with my short measure and that, on the contrary, it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown and learn from it.
And perhaps the most stupid reaction was that of the intelligent man who wrote, But are there still people who read French?; simply confirming that today there is a new type of ignorance that is being raised with abandon: that of those who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda Lê or even Sollers were awarded, or, among the new ones, Mathias Énard, but that does not detract from the dignity of Annie Ernaux's work (and it would have been enough to have written “Les Années”). There are books of hers that I like less, like the vulgar “Uma Paixão Simples”, but that happens with almost all authors, they have pivotal books and others that are like breaks in their itinerary. I recommend reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, “L’écriture comme un couteau”.

Yesterday an article appeared in the morning newspaper “Notícias”, in Maputo, reporting that the Pen Club Narrative Prize had been awarded to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already won the Maria Velho da Costa Prize.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, as it is pathetic, but what is important to highlight is the note of disqualification regarding its “Mozambicanness” when they call it Luso-Mozambican. It's not that it's inaccurate, but, for those who know the context, it's a touch naughty.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, Álvaro Taruma Ronga-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican for writers from the north, etc., etc. Which doesn't appear to happen.
At one point, in the novel, she writes:
«Our color was never the dominant one. In colonial times we were not white, we were dressed in monhés, mugs of washed asses, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goan and Portuguese. In the post-colonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me for Brazilian or Cape Verdean, in France they were lost in thought about where I was from and were surprised when they discovered that I was African. There I had to explain the wanderings of my DNA before settling in Mozambique. It took me a long time to accept that it was like that because yes, and that it was no curse that that was the case; on the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this harlequin cloak that is our genealogy…”
In modern-day Mozambique, it means being white… and that immediately takes precedence over what you do or what you are.
It's sad, but as Naipaul warned, in these parts race is everything and people live as deeply immersed in it as, in other places, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technology and religions and who entertained himself by turning his back on the dogmas of the “moderns”, has died. For him, the place, the role of the specialist, was defined more by the perplexity he embodied than by the supposed truth that would sustain him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the goodness of multiculturalism and its equivocal cliché “all different, all equal”, a return to “diplomacy”, given that this, precisely, does not start from the assumption that “we are unified because we share the same nature” but simply highlights that we “still do not share a common world”; It is necessary that we deal head-on with the “abyss of disagreement” that separates us, instead of trying to deceive it.
And about politics he said, boldly:
«If transparency is demanded from politicians, we kill them; if anyone demands fidelity to what the other was or what he says, kill him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, representation is killed. These must therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to bend the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put forward the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years.» (in “Un Monde Pluriel mais Commun”). I believe we will be needed to decipher this frantically complex world that has fallen to us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Fuxi</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these disastrous journeys through countries as old as the stars and the Moon, and as strange as the deepest interior of our wretched souls, what surprises still await us, what secret magics will we still have to overcome, what horrors will arise before our pupils dilated with astonishment and terror?
Increasingly closer to our precarious existences, howls the monster of war, which threatens to merge humanity once and for all with the earth, incessantly traversed by the squalid specter of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pestilences.
Oh damned human, who believes you are superior to Nature itself, but then you reveal yourself, time and time again, incapable of simply ordering your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by fickle anger and are a slave to your own ambition! You are not satisfied with white jade or resplendent gold, there is no treasure that quenches your inextinguishable thirst for command over other men, animals and things; for eternal anguish dwells in you; in you the expelled serpents crawl; for you grows, powerful and imposing, the most fertile ivy of Evil!
This is perhaps why on the Mount they call the White Deer, where one of the eight immortals on a sacred mount soared through the heavens towards Penglai, lives the fuxi, a bird whose shape resembles that of a rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulations, what monstrous embraces, what terrible procedures must have occurred to make the existence of this sinister animal possible? We don't know, but all it takes is for our exhausted mind to dare to come up with an answer, and then we feel our skin covered in horrendous goosebumps and our heart races in parade, like a wild horse whipped by the night whip of fear, unresponsive to reins and containment.
Let men refrain from visiting Monte do Veado, because although there are riches capable of calming the wildest ambitions, if they have the unfortunate luck of catching a glimpse of a fuxi, it is certain that a war will soon break out and the cultivated fields will perish, because of it the tame animals will be beheaded, because of it the best young men of two generations will be sacrificed and the pride of the countries will be destroyed.
The fuxi makes a sound reminiscent of its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, be on your way, because the path you are on is the surest path to misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>While rereading Easter, because of an article I'm preparing, I come across this excerpt, taken from “The Universal Man”:
«Each man, morally, is one and absolute; but he has to live with attenuating his personality. (…) Coexistence is only possible between people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which constantly gives way. Hence, the emptiness of society, an immense ghost made up of countless dead people. A superior man is antisocial or criminal. His destiny is prison and the desert”.
I hesitate to think whether Pascoaes reflects here on the political-social conditions that muzzle, and, worse, in a sad country like Portugal in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relationships were restricted, or if it merely lends to the behavior of (oppressed) men a metaphysical framework, an “essence”, declared in the presumption of each being, in isolation, “one and absolute”. Sometimes, in addition to an excess of Spirituality (or Saudade), Pascoaes lacks the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes Ampoules-of-Great-Ideas and who therefore writes often trapped by a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; It is not uncommon for a glass to be erected between him and reality, the same glass that made him write in O Bailado, from 1921: «Everything is a ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, of afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! And a divine lightning that pierces them, the instantaneous Apparition that appears and throws us to the ground, dazzled!»
Sometimes I felt like reminding him, as António Sérgio did, in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which he dedicated to Pascoaes: «Pascoais, Pascoais my dear friend: you are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I curse».
«As a child, he stole two blackbirds», says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, he stole them from a nest, and he felt remorse for that all his life. The Person, few more mischiefs are known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos does a hint of wickedness and obscenity emerge: «Ah, and the ordinary and dirty people, who always look the same,/ Who use swear words as usual words,/ Whose sons steal from grocery store doors/ And whose daughters at the age of eight – and I think this is beautiful and I love it! –/ Decent-looking men masturbate in stairwells.” (Triumphal ode).
Ambos os poetas assanhados por uma certa ideia de santidade, foi-lhes idêntica a inabilidade de romper o cerco da pele com o transbordo em dique alheio, a mesma maldição de sublimar a concreta ferocidade de eros com a mansuetude dos versos.
Obviously, they are both “bigger than life”, but sometimes it makes me unnerved to watch, from my position as a hatter at the Procrastinators Club, the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the position of President and Treasurer.
Although Pessoa guessed more things, for example, what he wrote in the lesser-known Ode Martial and which is reflected in the situation we live in today, deferred, with his heart in his hands:
«MARTIAL ODE

And a physical fear of being accountable to God makes me close my eyes.

I let the daughters of all fathers tied to trees be raped,

In an opinion article published yesterday in the British newspaper Financial Times, Macron highlights that China's trade surplus with the rest of the world has already reached one billion dollars, and that the imbalance with the EU has doubled in the last decade, reaching 300 billion euros. “This situation is not sustainable, neither for Europe nor for China”, he observes.
The French head of state recognizes that the current wave of Chinese exports to the European market is partly due to tariffs imposed by the United States and weak domestic consumption in China. However, it states that “responding with tariffs and quotas would be a non-cooperative solution”.
Macron rather calls for a coordinated approach that involves three fronts: strengthening European competitiveness, mobilizing savings for domestic investment and encouraging structural reforms in the Chinese economy. “Europe’s first step must be to implement a new economic agenda based on competitiveness, innovation and protection”, he argues.
Macron defended Europe's right to adopt a “European preference” to support strategic sectors such as automobiles, energy, health and technology, as long as they comply with international rules. “Protecting against unfair competition is the basis of resilience”, he maintains.
As for financing this transformation, the French President proposes channeling part of the approximately 30 billion euros in savings accumulated in the EU – of which 300 billion are invested annually abroad – to European companies. “It’s time for us Europeans to take the risk of investing in our own companies”, he argues.
Eyes on China
Macron emphasizes, however, that China also has responsibilities. “Beijing needs to correct its internal imbalances”, he states, defending a fiscal policy that is more favorable to consumption and the transition to a service economy. The French President also calls for a rebalance in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, recalling that the EU invested around 240 billion euros in China, while Chinese investment in Europe was below 65 billion.
“Europe must remain open to Chinese investment in sectors where China leads, as long as this contributes to employment, innovation and technological sharing”, he writes. Macron reiterates his call for a framework of economic cooperation between the EU, China and the US, warning that, in the absence of progress, Europe will have to resort to “firmer measures”.
"I prefer cooperation. But, if necessary, I will defend the use of protectionist measures", he warns, adding that the French presidency of the G7, next year, will put the rebalancing of global asymmetries at the top of the agenda. “I believe that, if we truly take into account the needs and interests of each person, we can build an international macroeconomic agenda that benefits everyone”, he states.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:21:13</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | Chinese tourism in Japan slows down in November</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/japao-turismo-chines-no-japao-desacelera-em-novembro/</link><description>The arrival of Chinese tourists to Japan slowed down in November, amid diplomatic tension between Tokyo and Beijing, despite the archipelago having registered a record number of foreign visitors, according to official data released yesterday. The total number of international tourist arrivals in November was 3,518,000, an increase of 10.4 percent compared to the same month in 2024, indicated the Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO).
Among the visitors, 562 thousand came from mainland China – a year-on-year increase of 3 percent, but well below previous months. In October, Japan had received 715 thousand Chinese tourists and, in September, 775 thousand – growth of close to 20 percent year-on-year.
“In addition to the demand for travel to Japan slowing down at this time of year, the Chinese Government warned the population to avoid traveling to the country”, said JNTO, highlighting that the year-on-year increase was also due to the greater supply of seats on flights.
The slowdown coincided with the recommendation issued by Chinese authorities following statements by Japanese Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, about Taiwan, which reignited diplomatic tensions between the two countries. Even so, between January and November, China remained the main source of tourists to Japan, with 8.7 million visitors, followed by South Korea (8.4 million).
In the first eleven months of 2025, Japan received 39,065,600 international visitors – 17 percent more than in the same period of the previous year –, already surpassing the record of 36.87 million registered in 2024 and approaching the target of 40 million by the end of this year.
The continued growth of tourism has fueled a national debate about the impacts of mass tourism, with some conservative parties demanding new restrictions on the entry of foreigners and stricter rules to preserve coexistence in local communities.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:18:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Deaths in the ongoing clash between Thailand and Cambodia already exceed those in July</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/mortos-no-confronto-em-curso-entre-tailandia-e-camboja-ja-ultrapassam-os-de-julho/</link><description>The armed conflict between Thailand and Cambodia in the border region left at least 52 people dead, a number that exceeded the number of victims of the July clashes, which killed 50 people, according to a report updated yesterday.
Thailand's Internal Security Operations Command raised the number of Thai soldiers killed to 19 and kept the number of civilian deaths at 16. Cambodian Defense Ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata counted 17 civilian deaths, including a child.
The conflict arises from an old dispute between the two countries over the sovereignty of territories close to the common border, which extends for approximately 820 kilometers and was mapped by France in 1907, when Cambodia was part of French Indochina. Phnom Penh said yesterday that Thai forces had “intensified attacks” at certain points along the border in recent hours and emphasized that they had carried out new bombings with F-16 fighter jets.
In addition to the armed conflict, the two neighboring countries are fighting a war of numbers: Cambodia avoids releasing information about soldier deaths, while Thai authorities claim that there are more than 500 casualties on the opposing side. Last week, Cambodian authorities dismissed reports of soldier deaths reported by Thailand.
The Thai Ministry of Defense, in turn, alluded to an “information war” also underway, local media reported yesterday.
Donald to the noise
The new wave of crossfire, which both sides accuse each other of having started, broke out on December 7th, with the 11 days of conflict already surpassing by almost a week the five days of violence in July, which ended after the mediation of several countries, led by Malaysia and including the United States.
North American President Donald Trump boasts of having put an end – albeit temporarily – to hostilities between the two countries in an agreement signed on October 26, and intervened again in the conflict, without apparent success, after its resurgence.
“[Trump] should ask Cambodia to stop firing first at Thailand, because Thailand has never fired first,” said Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, according to local media, after a telephone conversation with the American leader last week.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:14:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | China criticizes possible use of frozen Russian assets in the EU</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/ucrania-china-critica-possivel-uso-de-activos-russos-congelados-na-ue/</link><description>China yesterday expressed its “opposition to illegal unilateral sanctions not authorized by the United Nations Security Council”, given the possibility of the European Union using revenue from frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine.
“These types of sanctions violate international law,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun during a press conference in Beijing. Guo also called for the creation of “a positive environment and favorable conditions to promote peace talks”, stressing that “conditions conducive to a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine must be created, and not the other way around”.
China's position comes on the eve of the summit of the leaders of the 27 EU member states, which will discuss, among other options, the possibility of investing Russian assets frozen in European territory as collateral for a new loan to Ukraine, if Moscow refuses to pay for the damage caused by the war. The measure has generated divisions, with countries such as Belgium, Italy or Bulgaria expressing reservations.
Since the start of the large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, China has maintained an ambiguous stance, calling simultaneously for respect for the territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine, and consideration of the “legitimate security concerns” of all parties – an implicit reference to Russia.
Beijing has been strengthening its alliance with Moscow and rejected accusations by Western countries that it provides military support to Russia, insisting that these are unfounded allegations.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:13:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Justice | 27 people convicted of trafficking in strategic minerals</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/justica-condenadas-27-pessoas-por-trafico-de-mineral-estrategico/</link><description>A Chinese court yesterday sentenced 27 people to sentences of up to 12 years in prison for smuggling antimony ingots, in a case that arises in a context of tightening Chinese controls on exports of strategic minerals.
According to a statement released on the social network WeChat, the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court imposed a twelve-year prison sentence and a fine of one million yuan on the main defendant, identified as Wang Wubin.
According to the sentence, Wang collaborated with an international network of smugglers and, between February and March of this year, recruited several people to acquire antimony ingots, which were then exported illegally, without the licenses required by the Chinese authorities.
China is the world's largest producer of antimony – a metal used in industrial alloys and semiconductors – and included the element on its list of exports subject to control in September last year. Like gallium and germanium, antimony was temporarily banned from being sold to the United States, in response to the trade war between the two countries.
The remaining 26 defendants, most of whom were recruited by Wang to purchase and transport the metal, were sentenced to sentences ranging from four months to five years in prison, depending on the quantity trafficked. The case involves the smuggling of more than 166 metric tons of antimony, of which around 96 tons were seized by Chinese customs authorities, the court said.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:12:14</pubDate></item><item><title>HK | Drugs seized in the hull of a ship coming from Brazil</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/18/hk-apreendida-droga-em-casco-de-navio-vindo-do-brasil/</link><description>More than 400 kilos of cocaine, hidden in the hull of a Brazilian ship, were seized by authorities in the neighboring region. The case is the first of its kind, with the value of the drug amounting to approximately 2t56 million Hong Kong dollars
Hong Kong police announced the first case of drug trafficking in the hull of a long-haul ship, a vessel coming from Brazil.
Customs officials in the Chinese region seized around 417 kilograms of cocaine, with an estimated market value of 256 million Hong Kong dollars. According to a statement released on Tuesday, the operation was carried out in conjunction with the anti-smuggling department of Mainland China Customs.
“Through an intelligence analysis and a risk assessment”, the Hong Kong police suspected that criminals were using the underwater structure of a 333 meter long and 48 meter wide ship, which departed from Brazil, to hide drugs.
In an inspection carried out on November 5, at the Tsing Yi container terminal, Hong Kong Customs found 11 bags in a compartment of the boat, each containing between five and ten kilos of cocaine. Later, after an investigation, police officers arrested two men, aged 45 and 37, suspected of being involved in this drug trafficking case, who have since been released.
The investigation is ongoing and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out, Hong Kong Customs highlighted. At a press conference also held on Tuesday, the head of the Customs Drug Investigation Department said that the drug was discovered with the help of underwater robots.
Distribution warehouse
According to local press, Lau Yuk-lung revealed that the cocaine was hidden in a compartment located at a depth of 11 meters below sea level.
“Hiding drugs under a vessel is extremely rare”, highlighted the officer, especially because the compartment has “a very narrow entrance”. “We do not rule out the possibility that only professional divers will be able to access the site, as no ordinary person would be able to enter,” said Lau.
“The criminal group hid the drugs in the compartment and thought it was a relatively safe place,” added the officer. Customs believes that the criminal group intended to use the ship as a mobile drug depot at sea, which could distribute the cocaine to different regions.
In 2022, Hong Kong police seized 16.5 kilograms of cocaine in containers coming from Brazil, with a street value of 14 million Hong Kong dollars.
Customs officials in the region found the drug, hidden in two of the 230 bales of cotton fibers coming from Brazil, and later detained three suspects.
The crime of drug trafficking is punishable in the Chinese region with a fine of up to five million Hong Kong dollars and a prison sentence that can be life.</description><pubDate>2025-12-18 01:10:41</pubDate></item><item><title>Brazil | CMOC buys four gold mines in Portugal for 863 million euros</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/brasil-cmoc-compra-quatro-minas-de-ouro-no-por-863-milhoes-de-euros/</link><description>Chinese mining giant CMOC will acquire the operations of Canadian Equinox in Brazil for 863 million euros, gaining exploration rights over four gold mines, including reserves in Maranhão, Bahia and Minas Gerais. In a statement published on its official portal, the Chinese company indicates that it expects to complete the operation in the first quarter of 2026, still subject to approval from the competent regulators.
The sale will be completed through an initial payment of 900 million dollars and an additional payment of 115 million dollars, subject to sales volume during the first year after the official conclusion of the deal. CMOC will have three explorations that total around 3.87 million ounces of gold in reserves: Aurizona, in the state of Maranhão (northeast of Brazil); the Bahia complex (east), which includes the Fazenda and Santa Luz mines; and RDM, in the state of Minas Gerais (center).
“Taking into account Brazil’s rich natural resources and stable geopolitical environment, this acquisition represents a strategic addition to our existing assets, creating a stronger synergy and a growing presence for CMOC in South America,” said company president Liu Jianfeng.
The company says that, with this purchase and the start of operations at the Odin mine (Ecuador), its gold production could exceed 20 tons per year. According to the economic information newspaper Securities Times, these levels would place CMOC among the main gold producers in China, although still behind the sector leaders, Zijin Mining and Shandong Gold.
The newspaper recalls that CMOC is currently the world's largest producer of cobalt and is among the ten largest copper producers. Gold, considered a safe haven asset in periods of uncertainty, has fluctuated in recent days. Experts anticipate the metal will continue to rise into 2026, driven by central bank purchases.</description><pubDate>2025-12-17 01:39:47</pubDate></item><item><title>Thailand wants Cambodia to be the first to enter into a truce</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/tailandia-quer-que-camboja-seja-o-primeiro-a-assumir-uma-tregua/</link><description>Thailand declared yesterday that Cambodia must assume a ceasefire between them, in a border conflict that has already left at least 32 dead in 10 days and around 800,000 displaced.
“Cambodia must announce the ceasefire first, as it is the aggressor on Thai territory,” said Thai Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maratee Nalita Andamo at a press conference. That government official stressed that, “secondly, the ceasefire must be implemented and must be maintained”. “Thirdly, Cambodia must sincerely cooperate with demining efforts (in border areas),” he added.
According to the latest official figures, 17 people were killed on the Thai side (16 soldiers and one civilian) and 15 on the Cambodian side, all civilians. Cambodia on Monday accused Thailand of bombing Siem Reap province, where the famous Angkor temples are located, for the first time since border clashes resumed on December 7.
“The Thai army expanded the scope of its violent attack, using an F-16 fighter to drop two bombs near a camp for displaced civilians in the Srei Snam district,” the Cambodian Ministry of Defense said in a statement. Thailand confirmed that fighting continued yesterday in the border regions, without mentioning, however, the province of Siem Reap.
The Srei Snam district is about 70 kilometers from the disputed border and less than an hour and a half drive from the Angkor Wat complex, a jewel of Khmer architecture and Cambodia's main tourist attraction.
Pointed fingers
The two countries accuse each other of having unleashed hostilities, which led to the evacuation of around 800,000 people from both sides of the border. A first episode of violence caused 43 deaths in July, before a truce and the signing of a ceasefire agreement in October, which saw the intervention of the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump.
Trump said on Friday that the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia had agreed to a truce after a phone call, but the Thai government denied this and fighting continued over the weekend.</description><pubDate>2025-12-17 01:34:33</pubDate></item><item><title>Commerce | Taxes up to 19.8% on European pork</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/comercio-taxas-ate-198-sobre-carne-de-porco-europeia/</link><description>Chinese authorities have announced new duties on European pork imports to be applied over the next five years. The values, which vary between 4.9 percent and 19.8 percent, are significantly lower than those currently in force
China's Ministry of Commerce announced yesterday that it will apply tariffs of up to 19.8 percent on pork imports from the European Union, following an investigation into alleged unfair competition that began in 2024. However, the new rates, which come into force today and will last for five years, are significantly lower than the provisional tariffs of up to 62.4 percent applied since September to the European pork sector.
According to the statement published on the ministry's official portal, the rates will vary between 4.9 percent – ​​applied exclusively to the Spanish company Litera Meat, included as a sample in the investigation – and 19.8 percent, which will apply to companies that did not cooperate in the process, as well as the producer Vion, from the Netherlands.
For companies that collaborated with the investigation, the final rate will be 9.8 percent. The investigation was launched in 2023 and extended in June this year, with the Chinese authorities justifying the extension of the deadline with the “complexity” of the case. The case covered chilled or frozen pork, offal and fat, and sought to determine whether European exports violated competition rules and harmed local industry.
Spain was one of the most targeted countries, as it is the largest European supplier of pork to China, especially pork remains that are in low demand on the European market, such as ears, snouts or feet, but are highly valued on the Chinese market. In 2024, Spain exported around 540 thousand tons of pork products to China, worth 1,097 million euros, which represented almost 20 percent of the total volume and 12.5 percent of the value of the sector's exports, according to data from the Interporc association.
Other investigations
The investigation into the pig sector is part of a broader package of trade measures adopted by Beijing in retaliation against the 'anti-dumping' duties imposed by the European Commission, in October 2024, on electric vehicles manufactured in China - in a vote in which Spain abstained.
Since then, Chinese authorities have also opened anti-dumping investigations into other European products, such as brandy and dairy products. These measures worsened tensions between China and Brussels, in a context already marked by trade disputes, restrictions on the access of European companies to the Chinese market, controls on rare earth exports and friction in supply chains.
The practice of ‘dumping’ consists of selling products on a foreign market at a price lower than the cost of production. The practice is made possible by the granting of subsidies.</description><pubDate>2025-12-17 01:32:51</pubDate></item><item><title>Christian Montag, UM Institute for Collaborative Innovation: “AI cannot imitate the human touch”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/17/christian-montag-instituto-de-inovacao-colaborativa-da-um-a-ia-nao-consegue-imitar-o-toque-humano/</link><description>Can artificial intelligence help combat loneliness? The issue was analyzed in a study by the University of Macau, led by academic Christian Montag. The director of the Institute for Collaborative Innovation emphasizes that AI tools “are not long-term solutions” on a psychological level
How can artificial intelligence (AI) help overcome feelings of loneliness, if social networks cannot achieve this goal?
The “needs and gratifications theory” states that technology can only be successful if its use satisfies human needs, such as, for example, the need for social interaction. With AI companions, whether as stand-alone products or integrated into social media platforms, we have reached a new level, because human beings start talking to an artificial person and not with another human person, as happens on social media. Specific problems arise with these new AI companions, in that there are overly pleasant and charming AI systems that do not challenge a person's biased views of the world. Furthermore, many people around the world have become excessively dependent on these products, using them without critical reflection.
One of the conclusions of your study is that AI cannot, on its own, resolve feelings of loneliness. What steps in the investigation were followed to reach this conclusion?
There are well-conducted studies that show that interactions with AI companions can actually reduce feelings of loneliness. We do not doubt these results nor deny the potential that can arise from these interactions between humans and AI, as long as such systems are designed safely and when a human is not available. That said, we believe that these interactions between humans and AI do not represent a long-term solution.
Why?
This is due to the absence of social contact and the real presence of another human being when turning to AI companions based on large-scale language models, especially in moments of desperation. We have reviewed a vast literature that demonstrates that we need to take our evolutionary heritage seriously, with the real need for other human beings, particularly in the age of AI. Our perspective is based on many years of research in the area of ​​affective neuroscience. Still, it is clearly necessary to develop more new empirical studies that directly address interactions with AI and support this vision.
We run the risk of AI causing profound cognitive changes in people. To what extent? Can we change as human beings, especially when it comes to our need for others?
The same discussion arose with the appearance of smartphones. It is important to note that this oldest discussion has not yet been resolved: what happens or happened to our cognitive abilities when we began to permanently outsource the learning of telephone numbers, the guidance from A to B, among other tasks, to a machine? Recent research from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] suggests that the brain is less activated when using ChatGPT for writing tasks, compared to writing without such support. To me, this is not surprising and should not lead to moral panics. We have other more urgent problems, such as when real difficulties arise when inequalities in society increase, this is because some people use AI and others do not invest in this area.
What are the concrete impacts?
Some people may soon become very, very productive, while those who are not educated to use AI properly will not be able to keep up. Interestingly, we have observed in recent research that people with a deep learning style are more willing to engage with AI to become more productive. As for the question of whether we have changed in relation to our need for others, I highly doubt that, as these evolutionary impulses are genetically anchored in our species and we cannot simply eliminate them. Social needs are an essential part of what it means to be human.
Could these cognitive changes, if they occur, be more significant in young people than in adults, for example?
Interesting question. We know, from some studies on attitudes towards AI, that younger users tend to have more positive views about AI and, therefore, are more likely to adopt it in their daily lives. However, we are currently observing something quite problematic, such as the fact that AI is often eliminating jobs for young people just leaving university. Thus, AI appears to make it more difficult to enter the job market after obtaining a university degree. In other words, a lack of work experience makes things difficult for many young people. In the end, this could also lead to young people's perception of AI becoming more negative soon.
How should governments legislate or adopt policies to promote healthy acceptance and use of AI in society and schools?
We see very different approaches around the world to responding to the AI ​​revolution. I am German and, in Europe, we are seeing strong regulatory efforts with the so-called Artificial Intelligence Regulation (Artificial Intelligence Act). Personally, I am not convinced that the current European regulatory scheme is well planned, as I think it is too strict and, in some points, uses legally undefined terms, although I applaud the aim of promoting reliable AI and trying to reduce harm. I think the current regulation of AI in the European Union could go too far and end up harming the European economy by stifling much-needed innovation. But there are real dangers associated with AI and some regulation is needed.
What dangers?
I'm talking, for example, about the unregulated fusion between biotechnology and AI that could result in harm if people start to “create” new viruses in their backyards. I find Singapore's approach based on lifelong learning as a response to the AI ​​revolution very interesting. The Singapore Government offers its citizens the possibility of obtaining an academic degree in AI from the age of 40, with financial support from the State itself. What I like about this approach is that we need to remind people that it is also their responsibility to acquire new skills throughout their lives. This mentality must be instilled from an early age in schools.
In what areas of our lives can large-scale language models (LLMs) do more good than harm?
There are many routine and repetitive tasks where AI will be really useful to humans. However, we know from scientific literature that humans experience what is called “algorithm aversion”: in some areas of our lives, people do not like AI playing a role. For example, when we talk about couples therapy, people clearly prefer to talk to a human being than an AI system. Perhaps the closer we come to our evolutionary heritage in terms of caring for each other, the more the role of AI must be carefully monitored and reflected upon if we want it to have a place there. Personally, I wouldn't want to see my child being taken care of in kindergarten by an AI-powered robot.
How should psychology adapt to AI, given the growing number of people using it for this purpose?
There are different perspectives on this topic. Firstly, not everyone knows that psychology is a discipline that relies heavily on data. Therefore, psychology students are trained to become excellent data scientists. In this context, it is logical that our discipline adopts AI as a data analysis tool. However, I think it speaks to how psychologists view the increasing use of AI in human relationships. As with many things, this is complex. If AI enables better human communication, such as improving hearing aids for people with hearing problems, that is very welcome. If AI replaces human relationships, from my perspective it will cause problems. As we exposed in our most recent work, AI cannot currently successfully imitate human social touch or the real presence of another person.
At the Center for Cognitive and Brain Science at the University of Macau, what are the main projects developed in this area?
We have unique research opportunities at the University of Macau to study interactions between humans and AI, using neuroscientific techniques. I hope we can publish very interesting discoveries in the near future.
Humanity still lives here
Recently published in the scientific journal “Trends and Cognitive Sciences”, the article “Can AI really help solve the loneliness epidemic?” [Can AI Really Help Solve the Loneliness Epidemic?] counts Christian Montag, associate director of the Institute for Collaborative Innovation at the University of Macau (UM) as lead author, followed by academics Michiel Spapé, associate professor at the Center for Cognitive and Brain Sciences at UM, and Benjamin Becker, professor at the Department of Psychology at the University of Hong Kong, as co-authors.
According to a press release released by UM regarding this investigation, one of the main conclusions is that AI “will probably not be a long-term solution to human loneliness”. Quoted in this note, Christian Montag stated that “if a person is lonely, they long for the physical presence of someone close to them”, and this “is very difficult to imitate with the available chatbots”.
"The major language models operate primarily through text communication. Clearly, this is not enough to provide lonely people with the best cure for loneliness: direct in-person support," he stated. According to the World Health Organization, “loneliness affects one in six people worldwide”, having been “identified as a global public health concern”.
Despite the sign, the study points to a positive side of this universe, noting that “AI technology has significant potential to support human beings in moments of psychological crisis, especially when human intervention is not available”. However, “the researchers argue that the technology must be made safer before it can be used in this context”, emphasizing “the importance of remembering our evolutionary heritage and the need for genuine interpersonal connections”.</description><pubDate>2025-12-17 01:04:43</pubDate></item><item><title>Luís Bernardino, academic: “We need to define a defense cooperation strategy” for the CPLP</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/25/luis-bernardino-academico-precisamos-definir-uma-estrategia-de-cooperacao-defesa-para-a-cplp/</link><description>The book “25 Years of Defense Cooperation at CPLP” was released in 2023 in digital format and, two years later, reached the printed version. Luís Bernardino, co-author linked to the Autonomous University of Lisbon, highlights positive developments since the creation of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, despite inaction and controversies with Equatorial Guinea
“25 Years of Defense Cooperation in the CPLP [Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries]” was released as an e-book and is now available in print. Why edit this book?
This book talks about the 25 years of cooperation in the CPLP defense area and is written by me, together with a colleague from Brazil, Camila Rizzi. It results from a research project developed at the CPLP Strategic Analysis Center, based in Mozambique. It has the CPLP defense component and makes strategic reflection on this topic. Due to the fact that 25 years of cooperation have passed in this area, we wanted to carry out an evaluation and the book so that it would remain in the history of the organization. In 2023, there were no financial conditions to publish the book on paper as we wanted, and it was now launched on November 18th, in Maputo.
There is criticism regarding the effective action of the CPLP. Do you consider that this organism has grown sustainably?
The assessment I make is in the area of ​​defense. When the CPLP was created, cooperation in the area of ​​defense was not included in the initial six areas. This area only emerged in 1998. The CPLP was born with six main areas – culture, language, political-diplomatic concentration – and currently has 26 areas of cooperation, which is proof that it has grown in a sustained manner. Obviously, with ups and downs, situations have become easier over these almost 30 years. But what stands out in this book, in the area of ​​defense, is that there was a very consolidated and participated growth. In these 25 years, a lot of interesting things have been done and the evaluation is positive.
And the future?
We need to define a defense cooperation strategy and what we want for the CPLP in this area over the next 25 years. This is the challenge we face, of greater activity and initiative, so that cooperation and defense can be strategic in what is cooperation within States. So that it can be more visible and effectively allow for growth, participation and development, or even greater commitment, in regional contexts.
But looking at the past, present and future, what has the dynamic been like in the defense area?
The book shows a certain dynamic of substantial constitutional growth in the first phase. Then there were very interesting developments, with some protocols and cooperation at the level of the Armed Forces, but there is still a lot to do, namely looking at the area of ​​defense cooperation as a strategic area.
The global geopolitical system appears to be changing very quickly, following a multipolar path. Should the CPLP have another role in this context, with actors such as China, Russia or the United States?
The CPLP is not a multilateral instrument, it is not an organization of that level. We have to place the CPLP at the level of the Commonwealth, for example, of organizations at a cultural, linguistic level, of partnership between countries, of concern for development. What I usually say is that the CPLP is a good diplomatic communication instrument, a soft power in areas related to conflict management and prevention. Let us not expect there to be armed forces, or an army, from the CPLP. This body is one of dialogue and cooperation. What we do, in terms of defense, is exactly that, create partnerships so that there are mechanisms for responding to disasters, to provide training capacity for the armed forces. There are even those who ask the question: why did the CPLP not intervene in Cabo Delgado, in Mozambique, on the issue of terrorism?
And why?
Because the CPLP is not a hard power mechanism, it has no capacity, doctrine, logistics, mandate or viability to be used in combat operations. And CPLP Member States are very aware that we are a very good mechanism for cooperation, partnership and development, with contributions to culture and language. Therefore, the CPLP will not intervene in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, because that is not its area, nor does it have mechanisms for this dynamic.
Is the existence of the CPLP justified?
I think so, obviously, because, as I said, the CPLP is a very good instrument in terms of cooperation, the dissemination of the Portuguese language, of history. The fact is that we have around 350 million people who speak Portuguese. We have 30 countries that are associated observers, such as Ukraine, Chile, and Portuguese culture is represented in this organization. Each country has what it wants from the CPLP and gives it the importance it thinks it should give, and this depends on the foreign policy of each State. But I think the CPLP makes a lot of sense in the world we live in, and does so as a multilateral representative of language, culture, cooperation between Portuguese-speaking states, and those that ultimately have some affinity [with the Portuguese-speaking world]. The Macau issue is very specific to this organization.
Macau has the role of a commercial platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, and China has an agenda for Lusophony.
Before 1999 Macau had its own status within the CPLP, as it was administered by Portuguese. There was a Joint Declaration that allowed Macau, not being a Member State, to have, in a certain way, a protocol [with the CPLP]. When it became a Macao SAR, things changed and it lost that connection status, and Macau is not a member of the CPLP, and obviously cannot be. Neither does China, and it cannot be. Therefore, there is an associated observer status here that arises for countries, international and regional organizations, and even territorial entities with their own administration, which is also not quite the case in Macau. The territory is in limbo, between having a very strong history linked to Lusofonia, and having an administration very linked to China, which gives it, in my perspective, two dynamics.
In what sense?
Macau is a fundamental element in the connection between the CPLP countries and China. For all reasons, but due to the issue of language, history, and its representation, it is a fundamental actor in this cooperation. Macau must effectively be seen as a partner and as a gateway for China to Portuguese-speaking countries. This is what, in a way, is already happening, and this is what the CPLP will be paying attention to, in this relationship in which Macau has a special status. Whether we like it or not, it has an impact. Macau is an attractive factor in facilitating relations between China and Angola, Portugal or Brazil.
Does Equatorial Guinea's stay in the CPLP raise questions of credibility?
I agree with you. In these 30 years, it has been one of the main difficult moments in creating consensus. I remember that Equatorial Guinea was admitted in 2014, but there was already a process in the previous analysis phase. There was always an extension, year after year, and it was difficult to reach a consensus within the CPLP countries. In 2014, there was a summit in Timor-Leste and, through the action of Brazil and Angola, there was, in a way, a lot of pressure for Equatorial Guinea to join. But there are two principles, for better and for worse, that justify Equatorial Guinea's presence in the CPLP.
What are…
The first argument is that, in fact, Equatorial Guinea has Portuguese as its official language in its Constitution, despite us knowing that the Portuguese language, for example, covers four or five percent of society as a whole, and I am already being quite generous. But there is a commitment from the Equatorial Guinea authorities to develop Portuguese as a working language and there is a historical connection to Portuguese culture and Lusophony. Another criterion is the promise that, in the next constitutional review, a commitment will be made to abolish the death penalty. As for Portuguese, it's something that takes generations, it's not done from one year to the next. Not even in the next 10 or 15 years will we have Portuguese perfectly implemented. There is some shyness, a commitment, in a way. As for the death penalty, the fact is that, it seems, some change has been achieved. There has never been a death penalty action again [since accession]. And there is hope that, in the next constitutional review, this fact will be abolished from the Constitution and that it may, effectively, cease to exist. As a member of the CPLP, these changes will be easier and more visible and, in the future, Equatorial Guinea can effectively assume CPLP status taking these premises into account. I don't know if it will happen, I leave here a reluctance, and this is a challenging moment for the CPLP itself. Work needs to be done from within, so that Equatorial Guinea can be at the same level as other countries, especially in these two areas.
What is certain is that there remains a certain lack of transparency regarding what is happening in the country.
We are aware that Equatorial Guinea has major problems with issues of democratic legitimacy and elections. There are a series of situations that we recognize are not perfectly adequate given the status of CPLP countries. I think there is hope that things can change, an attempt to create space for Portuguese to grow within Equatorial Guinea, and also a commitment to greater openness and participation. What is a fact is that Equatorial Guinea has participated in CPLP meetings, and I have participated in some. In international situations we have to be pragmatic, and we hope that, just because Equatorial Guinea is in the CPLP, this can help Guinea itself to develop some mechanical gestures.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Timor-Leste / Independence – Mari Alkatiri: Proclamation was anticipated by the Indonesian military presence</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/24/timor-leste-independencia-mari-alkatiri-proclamacao-foi-antecipada-pela-presenca-militar-indonesia/</link><description>Interview by Isabel Marisa Serafim, from the Lusa agency
The leader of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin), Mari Alkatiri, said that the unilateral proclamation of independence was scheduled for December 1, 1975, but was brought forward because Indonesian troops were already in the territory.
“It was initially scheduled for December 1st,” said Mari Alkatiri, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which is marked on Friday, and of the Indonesian occupation, nine days later, on December 7th.
In November, Mari Alkatiri went on a “safari” through several African countries, mainly the Portuguese-speaking African Countries (PALOP), which involved participating in the declaration of Angola’s independence on November 11, 1975.
"After this 'tour', this African 'safari', I returned to the country. At the time I was in Maputo to prepare my return and I received a call from Nicolau Lobato not to return, because we needed to have someone outside the country", he recalled, highlighting that he did not follow the order from the then vice-president of Fretilin.
“So I returned to Dili on the 22nd or 23rd of November and the central committee and military political committee were meeting at the current headquarters of the National Police of Timor-Leste, which was the provisional headquarters of Fretilin, and the proclamation for December 1st was being discussed”, he explained. On November 28, Mari Alkatiri, then 25 years old, recalled that Nicolau Lobato came to her house and said that it was necessary to proclaim independence that day.
"We both left in his car for Lahane where Xavier do Amaral [former president of Fretilin] was and we conveyed this to Xavier Amaral, who clearly said to wait another three or four days. We said there was no time to wait and we decided to make the proclamation that day in the afternoon", he said.
"Fortunately, not only was the Constitution ready, but also the flag was ready. It was my mother who sewed the flag. There were minimum conditions for the proclamation of independence", stated the current secretary general of Fretilin, who also wrote the text of the proclamation.
“When I start talking about these days it’s not just memory, I actively participated in the unilateral proclamation of independence, although people try to cut out my photo, politics, but the truth is that there is only one person still alive who actively participated in the proclamation 50 years ago, that’s me”, he highlighted.
In the first Timorese Government, led by Nicolau Lobato and which only lasted nine days, Mari Alkatiri was appointed Minister of State for Political Affairs. Nocolau Lobato led the fight against the Indonesian occupation and was assassinated in December 1978. The restoration of independence took place on May 20, 2002, after a referendum for self-determination on August 30, 1999 and 24 years of resistance against Indonesia.
A question of egos
Mari Alkatiri also stated, in the same interview, that “egos” are preventing Timor-Leste from overcoming the challenges and that a more democratic, inclusive and comprehensive leadership culture is needed.
"If we managed it at the time, with all the difficulties, with all the challenges to overcome, at almost the speed of light, why can't we today? That's the question, the question of the cause. When the cause unites, the journey can go on, with many setbacks here and there, but we will succeed and we will win", said Mari Alkatiri in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which marks this Friday.
Asked about the reason for no union, the leader of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin) ​​said it was “egos”.
“I am following the budget debate, when we continue to think about State matters in a 'cantin' way, we are not going anywhere”, criticized the former East Timorese Prime Minister, whose party chose to abstain in the final global vote on the State Budget.
Regarding criticism of the current government's options, Mari Alkatiri said she did not know if there was ever an option. "I don't see a strategy. There are some successes here and there, tries here and there, but there is no strategy, but there is a lot of support for strategic planning, strategic investment, but I don't see it", he stated.
“There is a need for a much more democratic, much more inclusive, very comprehensive leadership culture, with a sense of mission and vision for the future”, highlighted the secretary general of Fretilin. The party leader also warned not to wait for the “bomb to explode”.
“The delay bomb is there, the time bomb is there, I hope we don’t have to, after that, apologize for the truth, after the bomb goes off”, he highlighted. Asked if the “bomb” is dissatisfaction, the former prime minister said: “complete”.
"A country that after 24 years of restoring independence, with the means it had to work, why did it fail? Lack of sense of inclusion. We are building a State, we talk about the Democratic Rule of Law, is that true? Or oligarchic", he asked.
The new generations
Still in relation to young people, who represent the majority of the approximately 1.4 million inhabitants of Timor-Leste, Mari Alkatiri said that they feel lost. "Young people are naturally more generous when they are more considered, or more rebellious, when they are revolted. There are two facets here in youth, one of generosity when they embrace a cause, the other is a much more violent reaction of confrontation", he said.
Pointing out that more than 70% of the population is under 35 years old, Mari Alkatiri warned that those “two generations have already been sacrificed” due to “poor quality” education and “increasingly worse health” and “no prospects”. “Now, we all say that oil money will run out, I see that for the Government, the alternative to oil is oil”, he said.
In September, the capital of the Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund was US$18.95 billion (€16.4 billion). “We kept dreaming about Sunrise and as I usually say while we dream about Sunrise, we will have the ‘sunset’, because there is no politics, there are no plans, there are no programs”, he added.
Mari Alkatiri was referring to the Greater Sunrise gas field, located 150 kilometers from Timor-Leste and 450 kilometers from Darwin, whose project has been involved in an impasse, with Dili defending the construction of a gas pipeline to the south of the country, and Woodside, the consortium's second largest partner, leaning towards a connection to the existing unit in Darwin.
The consortium is made up of the Timorese company Timor Gap (56.56%), the operator Woodside Energy (33.44%) and Osaca Gás (10.00%). The Government of Timor-Leste announced on Saturday the signing of a cooperation agreement with the Australian Woodside Energy for studies to process and export gas to the country.
Missing discussions
The secretary general of the Revolutionary Front of Independent Timor-Leste (Fretilin), Mari Alkatiri, defended the need for “all together” to discuss what failed in the last 24 years, after the restoration of independence in May 2002.
"There is a lot of talk about new paradigms and the old paradigm, we are ready to sit down together to discuss the old paradigm, why did it fail? No", said the former Timorese prime minister, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, which marks this Friday.
For Mari Alkatiri, everyone contributed with “their positive part, with their negative part”, but it is necessary to understand the failures in “individual terms”, in “collective terms” and there be “responsibility”. Asked by Lusa about the reasons why there is no such discussion, the leader of the Timorese opposition replied that a “leader who cannot sit at the table is not a leader”.
"The leader must know that there is a time to sit at the table. I made proposals. When I returned in 2018, I said 'my vote is so that the people can win', I didn't say for Fretilin to win. The message was clear, it was time for us all to think together. I ran the campaign saying Fretilin wins, Xanana wins", stated Mari Alkatiri.
The Fretilin leader said the response has been “revenge, hate”. "In such a way that to take revenge on me, it affects hundreds of people, families. If it's me, come and talk to me, you don't have to harm others, but this is a specific issue", he stated, referring to the Timorese Prime Minister, XAnana Gusmão. The fundamental issue, continued Maria Alkatiri, is “to have a sense of mission, a vision of the future and to have a common cause”.
"What is crucial is knowing all the money that was spent, what was done. A balance of collective and individual performance. When we were waging war, we knew what we wanted, to restore independence, 24 years after the restoration of independence we don't know where we are going", lamented the leader.
Mari Alkatiri also said he was “very concerned” about the report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which warned on September 11 of the proliferation of criminal networks in Oecussi, a Timorese enclave on the Indonesian side of the island of Timor, highlighting that recent investigations show contamination of the region.
"It is already being absorbed by the mafia cartel, who are coming here in all their strength. We have closed kiosks and we think we are fighting the mafia. I am very worried," he said. For the future, Mari Alkatiri stated that she will continue to fight, but to “create critical mass”.
"My fight now is not the concern with electoral cycles, but how I can actually create a true critical mass in Timor-Leste. Let's end blindness, many of our academic intellectuals get pregnant through their ears, but they don't get pregnant", he highlighted.
The Fretilin leader also told everyone in his generation that it is time to put “egos” aside and start “thinking together”, highlighting that they have another five years to do so. “The next term of governance must be the product of understanding if we really want this country to move forward”, stated Mari Alkatiri, highlighting that the Timorese people deserve “much more and much better” than what has been given to date.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 17:33:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Independence | Ramos-Horta: It is “thanks to Xanana” that Timor-Leste is here</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/23/independencia-ramos-horta-e-gracas-ao-xanana-que-timor-leste-esta-aqui/</link><description>The Timorese President, José Ramos-Horta, highlighted, in an interview with Lusa, the journey of the current prime minister and former leader of the residence, highlighting that it is “thanks to Xanana [Gusmão]” that Timor-Leste is here today.
“Xanana survived and with an impressive willpower, which few human beings can have, reorganizes the resistance, new attacks against the Indonesians”, said Ramos-Horta, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the declaration of independence, on November 28, 1975, remembering the attacks that the prime minister was the target of.
The Timorese leader lost men and suffered setbacks, but organized the clandestine network and resistance in the occupied cities. Xanana Gusmão was elected leader of the resistance and commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces for the National Liberation of Timor-Leste (FALINTL) in 1981, having launched the National Unity Policy, developed the Clandestine Front and established the National Council of Maubere Resistance, later named the National Council of Timorese Resistance.
"We reached the referendum in 1999 thanks to Xanana, not thanks to anyone else, obviously, the church got involved, because Xanana had the lucidity to talk to D. Martinho da Costa Lopes, abandon Marxism-Leninism. Thanks to Xanana that we are here today", stated the head of state.
Martinho da Costa Lopes was one of the most important figures in the Catholic Church in East Timor during the Indonesian occupation and played a central role in defending the human rights of the Timorese.
José Ramos-Horta also regretted that they now say that Xanana Gusmão is no longer the great man he was during the fight. "I say: gentlemen, now he was also the one who won the maritime border for us. I don't know who would win", he said, referring to the negotiation of maritime borders with Australia, concluded in 2018 and led by the current prime minister.
The President also highlighted that Xanana Gusmão was the one who took the historic decision to diversify from the Petroleum Fund in 2009, which “brought 11 billion dollars in return to Timor” and carried out the reconciliation, without persecution or judgment from anyone.
José Ramos-Horta also highlighted that it is Xanana Gusmão who “continues to have the technical competence” to discuss maritime borders with Indonesia, whose negotiation process began this year, as well as to resolve the Greater Sunrise issue, with the agreement expected to be signed at the beginning of next year.
"He wants to resolve all these issues before leaving power. He does not want to leave these very complex dossiers to the new generation", added the President.
Ideas and defenses
José Ramos-Horta stated that he was not in favor of the unilateral declaration of independence, on November 28, 1975, considering that it was made “hastily” given the imminent occupation by Indonesia.
"I was not in favor of the unilateral declaration of independence, I was, but it wasn't on November 28th. More preparation time was needed, because when you make a unilateral declaration of independence without any preparations, the result was what it was. There was no one. No one reacted", said Ramos-Horta, in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary.
On November 28, 1975, the current head of state recalls a ceremony without the presence of a “single global personality” and a dark night. "The unilateral declaration of independence was made hastily for reasons determined by the circumstances of the time. The fall of Atabae [municipio de Bobonaro]", said Ramos-Horta.
"The base fell with a large onslaught of regular Indonesian forces, already deep inside Timor-Leste. First Batugadé fell, that was in October, Balibó and Maliana fell, in October and Atabai, fell in the early twenties of November. Soon after, Fretilin declared unilateral independence", explained the President.
The occupation by Indonesia took place on December 7, 1975. “Indonesian forces were already in the national territory before December 7 and the decision in Jakarta had been made in 1974 either Timor-Leste integrates into Indonesia peacefully through some pseudo-democratic act, or Timor-Leste would pass to Indonesian domination by force”, said the Timorese head of state.
The invasion is supported by the United States, Australia and some countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
"Obviously, in that context of 1975, the United States would not support Portugal on the issue of Timor-Leste. On the issue of Timor-Leste, Indonesia weighed more, especially in the post-Vietnam war context, in which the United States was discredited and fled. For the United States and for the countries in the region, the communist threat was real and Timor-Leste was isolated, abandoned", highlighted the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
The liberation of Timor-Leste took place on August 30, 1999, when the referendum for self-determination took place, which gave victory to independence, which would eventually take place on May 20, 2002, after a transitional administration by the United Nations.
“Twenty-four years later the country is freed against all the prophets of defeat, all those who preached realism to us, to me, some said atrocious unrealism, others said a lost cause, we heard a lot, including in Portugal”, added Ramos-Horta, highlighting that Timor-Leste managed to prevail.
Defense of the constitutional amendment
José Ramos-Horta defended, in the same interview, a constitutional amendment to adopt the presidential system in the country, because there is a need for “clear authority” and “without duality” and ruled out a re-candidacy for the position.
"I believe that we should make a constitutional amendment and move to the presidential system. The President is the executive, the so-called semi-presidentialism is over", said José Ramos-Horta, in an interview with Lusa as part of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence, on November 28, 1975.
Currently, Timor-Leste has a semi-presidential system with a parliamentary bias, with the Government emanating from parliament. According to the head of state, the system chosen in the Constitution, drawn up in 2001 and 2002, “has not been bad at all”, but it has been seen that instead of “instead of being a balancing factor”, it can be a “factor of instability”.
Ramos-Horta exemplified what happened in the eighth Government, after the coalition led by Xanana Gusmão won the legislative elections with an absolute majority. “Xanana is invited to form a Government, they presented the list of rulers and President Lu Olo decides to veto, he did not want to inaugurate nine members”, said the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
"It is necessary to have a clear authority and without this duality, to share power with the President. It doesn't work. It works well in Portugal", highlighted Ramos-Horta. For the Timorese President, “there is no reason” for Timor-Leste to have adopted that model, because “balance is the parliament, the judiciary”.
"These three bodies are the constitution of the State. I think everyone will agree", he said. José Ramos-Horta considered that “it is time”, after around 25 years of the current Constitution, to make “some amendments” and move to the presidential system.
"For me, Xanana Gusmão should continue. We reach 2027, my term ends, new elections in 2028. Between the period of 2027, in which I leave, and 2028, we actively work on a constitutional amendment so that the 2028 election is already based on the new Constitution, that is what I defend", he explained.
When asked by Lusa whether he did not intend to run for a new term, the President stated that he was not “at least motivated”. “I, in 2027, will go to the ceremony of transition of the portfolio to the new President at midnight on May 19, 2027 and I won't even attend the ceremony on the 20th. I'm already in AeroDili on my way to Singapore”, he stated.
Problems of the new generation
In the same conversation, José Ramos-Horta also highlighted some of the country's current problems, namely the fact that the generation after 1975 has not yet found a leader with national affirmation. He highlighted that since 2002, members of this generation have held seats in the Government and parliament.
"The new generation has been there since 2002. The problem is that the new generation has not yet found a single person to assert themselves as a national leader. They have not yet appeared. That is the problem. They are in the Government, in the courts, in parliament, all new generations", said the President in an interview with Lusa on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of independence.
José Ramos-Horta also questioned who is the leader of the new generation that “has a national dimension”. “There is none, not one, because in a democracy you have to win the electorate”, he said, highlighting that a party is created and that party competes in the elections.
The head of state highlighted, however, that today Timor-Leste already has 210 doctorates and 1,700 masters, graduated from “good universities” and “there are people who know”. Timorese civil society has accused the current Timorese leadership, which continues to focus on figures from the resistance era, of creating obstacles to the emergence of new leaders with the capacity to respond to contemporary challenges.
Asked whether, after 50 years of the unilateral declaration of independence, the Timorese are reconciled, Ramos-Horta stated that among the “factions of [19]75 more than reconciled”. "Some have even died, the majority have died. There is no problem at all. When I see some brilliant being saying 'they are still the divisions of 75', you don't know that the majority have already died, only if they are the souls in the cemetery", said José Ramos-Horta.
According to the President, the divisions result from the democratic struggle. “I find it ridiculous, interesting, sometimes frustrating when I hear that the Timorese are divided,” said the President.
"Very well, let's all unite like it is done in North Korea, or rather, single party, single candidate, it is already known who wins the elections in North Korea, so there is not much headache, everything is simple, 97% votes for Kim Jong-un, then they do the recount and after all it was not 97%, but it was 101%. It's an option, then we are all united", joked Ramos-Horta.
But, he added, the Timorese chose democracy. "A democracy that is praised today and survives the wave of setbacks against democracy in Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe. We are doing very well with democracy", he concluded.</description><pubDate>2025-11-23 18:59:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist activist, 34 years old, physical engineer, Romani national. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, gentle humor and a smile that leaves no one indifferent.
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and gypsies – in particular – have lived in Portugal for around five centuries. What happens so that gypsy communities continue to be “on the margins” of so-called society? 
We need to change the model of society. This is extremely stratified, placing people in subordinate positions to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the ‘margin’ of society is in fact an intrinsic place within it, which belongs to it. In other words, gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in a status of inferiority compared to white people, without the right to human dignity, to found a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated of any and all cultural and material rights. A place built and maintained to this day by genocidal and ethnocidal violence and persecution. In 1463, Vasco Gitano was granted an estate. In 1521, the gitanos, or gypsies, were already used as a reference for everything that is considered bad in the model of society. The “counter-example” compared to white that would stand out in a positive way. The ‘angel’ and the ‘demon’; the ‘other’, the enemy; the one against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending oneself, having weapons, any type of property, and the right to stay.
And is it because they are denied the right to stay that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country today?
Yes, without a doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, by prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Roma people, because they are Roma; and also through the gentrification process.
I read the results of a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, where it is said that approximately 80% of Roma respondents live below the risk of poverty threshold in their country; one in three gypsies lives in a house without running water; one in three Roma belongs to a family in which someone went to bed hungry at least once in the previous month; and 50% of Roma aged between 6 and 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historic persecution that continues. There is no impoverishment that does not have an external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation is imposed on the basis of violence. As early as 1648, D João IV, the Restorer, prohibited ‘giving or renting houses to gypsies’. The same D João IV who achieved the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 Knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who died defending Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Among prohibitions on staying, “that gypsies do not enter the kingdom and those who are in it leave” (D João III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, banishment to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with penalties of flogging, mutilation and death, systematically carried out to this day (even in 2011 the Faro City Council wanted to ban gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working for others (no one employs gypsy workers, and those who do do so in complete precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without rights and dignified conditions). They are unable to remain dependent on self-employment, they are unable to invest, due to extreme expropriation. They become dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it's like to live in pure neoliberalism, get to know the lives of gypsies. The reality of these is paradigmatic of the aggression and lack of protection that the “lords” are willing to go to, for their own benefit.
The gentlemen we are talking about, is it economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group has been in power since it instituted the current system of domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to put an end to ‘lords’ and establish a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model in which we live leads the gypsy community (and beyond) to economic exclusion, removing them from access to the consumption of products or excluding them from their production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; to education and consequently the social exclusion seen in the inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, healthcare, etc. How does a gypsy child feel when they realize they are not part of the whole? Children who never see themselves represented, not in films, not in books, not in cartoons, not even in an advertisement eating cereal, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is it a priori condemnation?
That's really the question. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, on the contrary, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', an Orwellian term, and people are under duress. Which concentration and extermination camp. In fact, the Nazi concentration camps are a more visual embodiment of what is called 'social exclusion' and, as here, they were not an 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are kept by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. Just like in the Nazi concentration camps.
And what you listed as an example of the ‘consequence’ of this ‘exclusion’, is in fact the means by which this exclusion also happens and is maintained. Gypsy people are outside the cinemas, either as consumers or producers (but they go to the cinema). They are outside of school, education and the Academy. Either as ‘users’ or as producers (but they go to school and are at the basis of the construction of knowledge and academic and scientific debates).
Even in the attack on the gypsy child's self-confidence, we speak of a mechanism for maintaining this situation. But gypsy people respond very well: with gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this modern model of society. And they resist and counter the power of domination and insist on being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the Academy, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you mean to say there is collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, gypsy people rolled up their sleeves and once again showed proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned by watching and doing. And here, it is again women who jump to the front line, show their face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or sons, and launch themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as app-based work (transport or couriers). In housing, in a pandemic context in which evictions were not stopped – as the law itself should and dictates – residents did not stop organizing and fighting against unfair evictions and demanding dignity in housing; residents associations allied in their action with other housing and anti-racist organizations.
It is also worth noting how they reinvented themselves and intensified to collect and distribute food items and mask/alcohol gel kits to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non-gypsies. In the anti-racist fight, new movements emerged and their actions intensified through social media. People who had never organized or become active before began their first steps in activism, joining this path of gypsy and anti-racist organization and popular action. People forget, or don't want to appreciate, but gypsy action has helped to determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large numbers and determined electoral results in the 2017 local councils, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the Presidential elections, second place was decided by an amount equivalent to the estimated number of gypsy voters. Apart from the non-gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-building power in opinion spaces, in local media, on social networks and in party and institutional political disputes. And most importantly, in popular action and in alliances with other social movements. We never stopped fighting by all means and we continued to resist.
On the other hand, there is more and more hate speech, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about that?
To begin with, these speeches are historical and European. They are neither current nor “extreme right-wing”. Esses discursos são adoptados e proferidos há muito tempo, mesmo em ‘democracia e liberdade’, por vários representantes do centro-direita, conservadores, centro esquerda, liberais, esquerda liberal, até representantes do PCP. Anti-gypsy rhetoric has always worked in Portugal, as it is the most white-natured rhetoric. That is, it allows the creation and recognition of “white” as the superior of all. And thus please the white electorate who, when they feel good, compensate with their vote. Even if the policies implemented by your elected officials harm you even more.
Finally, I would like you to talk a little about your personal experience and how you became an activist?
I studied, fought for my studies, made alliances, graduated, and entered the “formal precarious” job market. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society into a better one. This certainty, combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering, makes anyone want to have a transformative attitude. I wanted to be an ‘inventor’ (physical engineer) and an anti-racist activist. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with other people, in turn, with other studies, training and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
This gives rise to two types of actions: transformative and survival. The fight against hate speech appears as survival, but its defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that – as people who want a better world – we have to do, namely work to criminalize hate speech; condemn and ban organizations with racist speeches and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logic that organizes Power and manages community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, from petitions to demonstrations. And we need more.
In addition to being a member of the SOS RACISMO movement, I participate in the Podcast “Viemos Para Ficar”, with Mamadou Ba and Joseph da Silva. And if everything goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the “Cigana Initiative” project, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-gypsyism, denouncing historical and ongoing genocide and working towards a new societal project. Also with new projects in the pipeline. And finally, there are always voluntary actions, without an organization, where I try to share what I discovered about Anti-Gypsyism and Romani history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and employment precariousness, racialized individuals, especially Roma nationals, are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which puts profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP | Unanimity regarding “Super Pole” in GT</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/05/gp-unanimidade-quanto-a-super-pole-nos-gt/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) should continue to focus on the “Super Pole” system for the ninth FIA GT World Cup, if this race is once again included in the program of the 73rd Macau Grand Prix next year
For the first time, in last November's edition, the ten fastest in Qualifying 1 had 20 minutes to prepare for the first “Super Pole” in the history of the FIA ​​GT World Cup, in which, in reverse order of times, each driver entered the track alone for one out lap, two timed laps and one return lap, with one-minute intervals between competitors and the possibility of using a new set of tires. The best time obtained between the two timed laps determined Qualification 2 “Super Pole”, which defined the starting grid for the Classified Race.
Following the success of this initiative, the international federation intends to continue applying it in the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup, having even produced a promotional video to confirm this. Lutz Leif Linden, President of the GT Commission and the FIA ​​Constructors' Commission, admits that this is something “very exciting for the spectators as well as the drivers”.
Present in Macau during the Grand Prix, the influential Stéphane Ratel, CEO of SRO Motorsports Group, co-organizer of the Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup, also agrees with the measure, highlighting that it represents "an additional challenge and one that works. At SRO we do this on a global level. In the biggest events, like the 24 Hours of Spa, we have a 'Super Pole', and it is something we like."
Riders and brands agree
Drivers and brands were equally impressed with this first experience on the territory's streets. “Macau is already special and I think that, with this format, we had something even more special”, recalled Antonio Fuoco, the driver who gave Ferrari its first in Macau since 1995.
Ferdinando Cannizzo, head of Ferrari's Competizioni GT, reinforces the idea, highlighting the technical advantage when the challenge comes down to the driver and the circuit, without external interference. “Without cars, without traffic, you can really focus on your strengths and try to maximize the car’s performance”, said the Cavallino Rampante brand representative.
This qualification system, an important moment of the weekend given the difficulty of overtaking on the Guia Circuit, also adds an element of uncertainty and elevates the spectacle. Stefan Gugger, responsible for the development of Lamborghini's competition cars, said that, in his opinion, "it's an improvement for our fans. We can really see the performance of the driver and the car, which also represents a good challenge for the team."
Porsche, one of the brands that most advocated the mandatory introduction of expensive torque sensors in this race, was also one of the main drivers of the “Super Pole”. “I believe the new format is a real step forward,” said Thomas Laudenbach, Vice President of Porsche Motorsport. "It allows the drivers to have clean laps. It's a great step in the right direction, maybe with some tuning, but overall for me it's positive. I hope they maintain this format because it's fantastic."
Meanwhile, the date of the 2026 edition of the Macau Grand Prix is ​​expected to be confirmed next week, during the FIA ​​World Council, which will take place before the FIA ​​awards ceremony for 2025, in the city of Tashkent, Uzbekistan.</description><pubDate>2025-12-05 01:52:45</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | FIA will continue to invest in Formula Regional in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/24/gp-fia-vai-continuar-a-apostar-na-formula-regional-em-macau/</link><description>The fact that the FIA ​​switched from Formula 3 to Formula Regional (FR) continues to be a recurring theme when the topic is the Macau Grand Prix. Although the show's premier race did not disappoint in this year's edition, somewhat erasing the bad image left last year, there is still a widespread feeling that the international federation deprived the Grand Prix of its favorite race.
At the end of the 72nd edition, the Coordinator of the Organizing Committee of the Macau Grand Prix, Lei Si Leng, when questioned again by the local press about a possible return of Formula 3, stated that the organization will continue to cooperate with the FIA ​​to choose the races that best suit Macau. At the same time, the director of the Macau Sports Institute left the guarantee that the plan involves continuing to receive drivers of training age and who assert themselves as the future of motorsport.
“We have been communicating closely with the FIA ​​to find out which races can be held in Macau and the FIA ​​has selected the best drivers to come and compete here”, he said, adding that he hopes “that the best drivers can come to Macau and that we continue to collaborate with the FIA ​​to organize the most suitable races for Macau”.
On the FIA ​​side, there is the conviction that FR is the discipline that best adapts to the characteristics of the Guia Circuit, a layout that remains practically unchanged after seven decades of existence. The discontent that still exists is considered natural. “Motor sport is traditional, and I don't remember any change that was well received at the beginning, even good changes” admitted Emanuele Pirro, the current president of the FIA ​​Single Seater Commission, in conversation with journalists in Macau.
The former Italian driver, a connoisseur of the Guia Circuit and winner of the Guia Race with BMW, took advantage of his time in the Macao SAR to remember that “if we look at the history of Macau, it started with Formula 2, or Formula Pacific, and then moved on to Formula 3. In 1984, a journalist could have asked: 'why don't we race in Formula 2 anymore?' I think it's inevitable. Everything has a price. For us to have the privilege of having a circuit that has remained unchanged since Throughout its history, the price to pay is to use cars that continue to be reasonably safe. And I think Formula Regional offers a good balance in terms of speed.”
In a rare interview with the specialized magazine INSIDE, the former coordinator of the Grand Prix, José Manuel Costa Antunes, warned against letting the level of the race drop. "Today, with the transition to Formula Regional and Formula 4, which is not a problem, they are just different cars, we see more inexperienced drivers", said the man who was at the helm of the event for the longest time, touching on a sensitive topic: "Some people can simply buy a seat. That is worrying. As fans, we want real races, not red flags. We owe it to the history of the Grand Prix to recover that selection process, to ensure that only the best compete here."
Numbers support the decision
Looking at the time sheets, it can be concluded that the records for the main FR race were around 2m16s, around ten seconds slower than the times recorded in the last year of the FIA F3 single-seaters, in 2023. In historical terms, these times place the FR cars on a level similar to that of the Formula 3 cars of the late 1990s. However, from a safety point of view, the speeds reached in the “Sprint” for Curva Lisboa continues to be the main concern since Sophia Flörsch’s accident in 2018. With the suction cone, speeds above 290 km/h were common in 2023 with the Dallara F3, but the change to FR cars reduced these values to around 260 km/h.
In 2026, the new Formula Regional car, the Tatuus T-326, is expected to arrive in Macau, which is equipped with a three-cylinder, 1.6-liter Toyota ATM163T engine, prepared by Autotecnica Motori, which is more powerful and efficient. The chassis was designed according to the latest FIA specifications, in order to provide improvements in terms of performance, safety and aerodynamics, facilitating overtaking and promoting more lively racing. However, although lap times are expected to drop again, top speeds will probably not be dramatically higher.
It should be noted that the change to FR was not motivated solely by security concerns. When the FIA ​​granted Formula One Management (FOM) the commercial and promotional rights for Formula 3, the territory's race became a non-championship race of an international competition, limited to the participation of the same teams that competed in the championship. This change was received unfavorably by the promoter himself, as he never played a truly intervening role within the Grand Prix. Furthermore, holding the race in Macau, in November, involved particularly demanding logistics, with a negative impact on the planning and execution of pre-season tests.</description><pubDate>2025-11-24 05:37:32</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Date and two competitions confirmed</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/12/gp-data-e-duas-competicoes-confirmadas/</link><description>The final meeting of the 2025 FIA World Motor Sport Council took place last Wednesday, during FIA General Assembly Week, in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The session was attended by delegates from the various National Sports Authorities (ASNs), from which important decisions were taken, some of which concern Macau
The date of the 73rd Macau Grand Prix has been officially revealed, confirming that the Macao SAR's biggest annual sporting event will take place from 19 to 22 November next year. The international federation also took the opportunity to announce that the date and location of the ninth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup, which has been contested at the Guia Circuit since its creation, as part of the Grand Prix program, have been approved by the GT Commission. The same entity did not reveal the guidelines for next year's race, which in this year's edition only featured sixteen competitors, but this is the first time it has confirmed it so early.
For its part, the Touring Car Commission confirmed the calendar for the next season of the Kumho TCR World Tour, which will once again end at the Guia Circuit, as in previous years. China's strong presence on the calendar stands out: the Macau and Zhuzhou races are joined by an absolute debut, the new Chengdu Tianfu International Circuit. With eight events – one in Mexico and three in Europe, including the visit to the Vila Real International Circuit -, Asia gains new importance with a total of four rounds.
Four of the 2026 Kumho TCR World Tour events will maintain the traditional two-race format, including Macau, while the remaining four – Mexico, Spain (Valencia), South Korea (Inje) and China (Chengdu) – will adopt the three-race-per-weekend format introduced last year, reaching a total of twenty races in the season.
The FIA ​​World Motor Sport Council has not publicly commented on the continuation, or not, of the Formula Regional (FR) and Formula 4 World Cups in the Macau Grand Prix program, even though the latter's project, which also involves the Chinese promoter Mintime and the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile (FFSA), was designed for three years.
Also bet on karting
The World Council also approved the regulations that support the expansion of Karting under the supervision of the FIA, at a time when the next phase of implementation of the “Global Karting Plan” begins, which, next year, will integrate new “Arrive &amp; Drive” championships, included in one of the most extensive calendars ever.
Following the auspicious start of the FIA ​​“Arrive &amp; Drive” Karting World Cup, held in Malaysia last month, the innovative format will be expanded with new continental championships, bringing these accessible and affordable events closer to communities around the world. The 2026 calendar, already approved, will feature a European Championship and an Asia-Pacific Championship, each consisting of three rounds, the winners of which will secure a place on the 2026 FIA “Arrive &amp; Drive” Karting World Cup grid, to be contested at the end of the season.
The Coloane Kart Track, still one of the most modern in Southeast Asia, will be part of this first edition of the “Arrive &amp; Drive” Asia-Pacific Championship, hosting the inaugural race on the weekend of June 20th and 21st. The calendar of this low-cost competition also includes two other stages: one in Zhuzhou, in Hunan Province, and another in Madras, India.</description><pubDate>2025-12-12 01:19:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau | Rosa Mota in second place in the minimarathon</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/12/09/macau-rosa-mota-em-segundo-lugar-na-minimaratona/</link><description>The Portuguese Rosa Mota came second on Sunday in the Macau mini-marathon, a 4.5-kilometer race that is part of the International Marathon in the Chinese region. The 67-year-old former Olympic champion finished the race in 17 minutes and 10 seconds, 54 seconds more than the first, local athlete Kin I Chao.
In February, the Portuguese woman was discharged from hospital, following a planned surgical intervention, after overcoming a “serious problem”, a “dissecting aortic aneurysm”. Rosa Mota, born in Porto, was Olympic marathon champion at the Seoul Olympic Games in 1988, after having won bronze in Los Angeles in 1984. Her achievements also include three European titles (1982, 1986 and 1990) and one world title (1987).
She is still the national marathon record holder, with a time of 02.23.29 hours, a mark achieved in Chicago in 1985. In recent years, Rosa Mota had reappeared at the highest level and won several veteran races, having set in Barcelona, ​​in 2024, the world half-marathon record (1:24.27 hours), for the 65 to 69 age group.
Also last year, the Portuguese won the Macau mini-marathon, repeating the triumphs in 2018, 2019 and 2023. This year, the organization invited several athletes, nominated by the Association of Portuguese Language Olympic Committees (ACOLOP), from Portugal, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sri Lanka and the state of Goa (India).
Lusophony highlighted
Lusophones were in the spotlight in the half-marathon, with Cape Verdean Samuel Freire, from Sporting Clube de Portugal, finishing third in the men's race, behind winner Martin Ndungu and David Kipkorir Rono, both Kenyans.
In fourth place came the Portuguese Fábio Oliveira, 30th in the marathon of the first edition of the European Road Championships, in April, and part of the Portugal team that finished in fourth place. Soon after came the young Mozambican Pinto Victor Jequecene, aged 22, while Angolan David Jundo Elias finished in seventh place.
In the women's race, Angolan Lúcia Kawele Capingala came in third place, behind the winner, Kenyan Lucy Ndambuki, and Chinese Na Zhao. Already off the podium, in fourth position, finished the young Portuguese Joana Ferreira, who won the silver medal in the under-23 race of the national athletics championships in 10 thousand meters, in May.
Mozambican Domingas Ernesto Checane came in sixth place. Around 12 thousand participants signed up for the three races of the Macau International Marathon, with the title of the premier race going to Kenyan Victor Kipchirchir and Ethiopian Senay Mastewal Birhanu.
In addition to his triumph, Kipchirchir broke the Macau marathon record, finishing in two hours, nine minutes and 27 seconds, 34 seconds less than the previous record, set in 2017 by Ethiopian Felix Kiptoo Kirwa.</description><pubDate>2025-12-09 03:18:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorsport | GP will continue on the TCR World Tour in 2026</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/19/automobilismo-gp-continuara-no-tcr-world-tour-em-2026/</link><description>The Macau Grand Prix will once again form part of the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour calendar next season and, once again, as the season-ending event of a competition that will increase its presence in Asia in 2026
Marcelo Lotti, president of the WSC Group, confirmed to the press, during the weekend of the 72nd Macau Grand Prix, that next year's calendar should include a race in South Korea – home country of the tire brand and championship sponsor, Kumho, as well as Hyundai, the brand with the most cars on the starting grids of the world competition -, a second race in the People's Republic of China and the traditional end-of-season round at the Guia Circuit.
To increase the presence on the Asian continent, without affecting the teams' budgets, Australia will be left out of the calendar. The championship promoter will also not move forward with the possibility of organizing a second race on the American continent, with a visit to Mexico being a certainty. Already on the “old continent”, the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour will maintain its three events, with the Portuguese city circuit of Vila Real hosting one of these events in July.
For Marcello Lotti, “the Macau Grand Prix is ​​our equivalent to Monaco”, and for the Italian businessman, “all championships need an event like this”. Despite the smaller number of entrants that this year's event gathered in the territory, “leaving Macau is obviously out of the question”.
The 2026 Kumho FIA TCR World Tour season calendar is expected to be revealed to the public on December 13, when the FIA ​​World Council meets in Tashkent, Republic of Uzbekistan, at the same time as the FIA's annual awards ceremony.
Number questions
The list of participants for the Guia Race Macau – Kumho FIA TCR World Tour Event of Macau had only seventeen of the twenty-four cars initially registered. This would have been one of the smallest starting grids ever for the highly popular Guia Race, whose first edition took place in 1972. In part, this number below expectations was due to the absence, for unknown reasons, of teams and drivers from TCR China, one of the strongest national tourism championships in the world.
Meanwhile, Marcello Lotti said during the Grand Prix weekend that TCR is preparing to welcome a new brand to the championship. However, this announcement, scheduled for next Friday, is not expected to have an impact on the starting grids of the Kumho FIA TCR World Tour, as it will be a car group that already has a presence in the championship and will replace one of its brands with another. The Italian businessman also said he was in negotiations with a second brand.
Asia's influence on today's biggest Touring Car championship is not just limited to the Koreans from Kumho and Hyundai, as the competition also features the Chinese brand Link &amp; Co, at an official level, and the Japanese counterpart Honda. At a time when electric cars, SUVs and city cars are the focus of big brands, Asian manufacturers are still among the few that invest in cars, with fuel engines, with dimensions suitable for Touring events.</description><pubDate>2025-11-19 01:34:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Roadsport | Badaraco took the podium on his birthday, but ended up penalized</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/11/17/roadsport-badaraco-subiu-ao-podio-em-dia-de-aniversario-mas-acabou-penalizado/</link><description>On his birthday, Badaraco recovered from 17th to reach second place on the podium. Hours after the party, the bad news arrived, with a penalty relegating him to 15th. Rui Valente was placed off the track, after recovering several positions
On his birthday, Jerónimo Badaraco climbed to second place on the podium of the Roadsport Challenge race, after starting from 17th. However, the worst came later, when the top three, all local drivers, were penalized and relegated in the general classification, for overtaking other cars that had lost their way before the starting line, after the safety car had left.
The Macanese driver had a setback when he was relegated to 15th, after an almost perfect race: “It was very unfair and I think the stewards don't know what they are doing”, said Jerónimo. "I think the decision was not transparent. After the safety car came out, several drivers hit the barriers... of course we thought they weren't going to continue in the race after those crashes and we had to overtake them", he explained. “And even if we had stopped or slowed down in the face of these drivers' missteps, we would have created a much more dangerous situation for everyone, because the cars behind us would have been surprised by our braking, meaning there would have been more accidents”, he explained.
Even so, the Macanese assured HM that the penalty would not ruin his day: “I will continue to enjoy the day, I went up to the podium, drank the champagne, took the photos… More cup, less cup, I will continue to celebrate”, he guaranteed with a laugh.
Hours before, Badaraco had already explained that reaching the podium in Guia “is a different feeling” that justifies “80 percent” his choice to drive 26 years ago.
The driver was also satisfied with the race, considering that no one can take away the merit of what he achieved on the track, as he rose from 17th to 2nd: "Before the race I thought a lot about how I was going to approach the start, to recover positions, and I was confident of a good result. The most important thing was not to have given up, after qualifying, and not to have stopped believing that it was possible to reach the podium", explained the Macanese driver. “I know that the Guia Circuit always has a lot of changes throughout the race, there are a lot of safety cars and yellow flags, and I knew I had the experience, and also the calm, to be able to take advantage of the opportunities”, he highlighted.
“They ruined my race”
In turn, Rui Valente gave up and appeared disappointed, due to what he considered to be an excess on the part of the driver who tried to overtake him on the inside, on the curve leading to the São Francisco road. "I don't know what was going through the driver's head who tried to overtake me. I can't understand how he saw a space that simply didn't exist!", said Valente. "I was put out of the race. When I tried to make the turn, he touched me and that was it, my rear end was damaged and I had to go back to the pits to retire", he reported.
When the crash occurred that ended the race, Valente was circulating in the top 10, even after a less successful start, following the exit of the first Safety Car. Despite this aspect, the Macanese came to believe that it was possible to achieve a result in the top five: “I had a good pace, I was confident and I think I would achieve a result in the top five... It's the races...”, he lamented.
The Macanese also took stock of a “complicated” weekend in which he was also involved in another accident during the free practice session. "To be honest, it wasn't one of the weekends I had the most fun in Macau. I had that first touch, which conditioned my qualifying. In the race I actually did well, gaining positions, but they put me off the track...", he highlighted.
At 64 years old, Rui Valente now admits that he may be left out of the next edition of the Grand Prix: “With such a difficult qualifying model for Macau and then with races with so many accidents, I will consider what to do in the future”, he confessed. “I don't want to sit still, I want to stay active and involved in different activities, so if I find an activity that occupies me and makes me feel good, maybe I'll stay out of racing next year”, he said.
