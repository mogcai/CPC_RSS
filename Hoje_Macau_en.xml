Growth is in line with the rhythm of expansion achieved by the world's second largest economy in the fourth quarter and exceeds the goal of “about 5 percent” to the year 2025 established by Beijing.
The impulse comes at a time when US President Donald Trump intensified the Beijing Trade War, threatening a total dissociation between the world's two largest economies, at a time when China already faces a prolonged real estate crisis.
The data released by the National Statistics Office (GNE) exceeded the consensual estimate of 5.2 percent of economists responded by the Bloomberg news agency.
Industrial production expanded 7.7 percent in March, compared to the same period of the previous year, in faster growth since June 2021. Retail sales have increased by 5.9 percent, the best pace since December 2023.
"The most pleasant surprise is retail sales, which shows that consumption subsidies are working," said Michelle Lam, economist at French Bank Society Generale SA to China, quoted by the agency. "Industrial production was a surprise, but understandable after the strong export data. But this is now part of the past," he told Bloomberg.
Despite the positive data, the GNE recommended caution, stressing the need to give greater support to the economy.
"We must be aware that the external environment is becoming more complex and severe. The impulse of internal demand for growth is insufficient and the basis for economic recovery and sustained growth is yet to consolidate," the office said in a statement. “We have to implement more pro-active and effective macroeconomic policies,” he said.
Investment in fixed assets increased by 4.2 percent in the first three months of 2025, while the real estate investment registered a 9.9 percent contraction, extending the crisis that reached the sector in 2022. The urban unemployment rate was 5.2 percent in March, down 5.4 percent in the previous month.
Bonança and Storm
China may have difficulty reaching its official growth objective this year without further stimuli. In recent weeks, several international banks, including the UBS Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc., have lowered their growth forecasts from China to about 4 percent or less, the result of the aggravating commercial tensions with Washington.
Some economists expect China's Popular Bank to reduce interest rates or the amount of money banks should keep in reserve this month, while others provide for several Yuan billion in loans and additional tax expenses to fill the void left by falling exports.
China has to rapidly increase domestic consumption and investment to counteract the impact of tariffs. The weakness of the labor market continues to prevent consumers from spending more, even before US fees reach export -related jobs.
The impact of the trade war will probably speak out of economic activity from April, after an increase of 12.4 percent of exports in March, as companies rushed to complete orders.
The possibility of an agreement between the US and China on commercial dispute seems reduced in the near future, as Beijing chose to retaliate the successive rounds of Tarump -imposed tariffs.
China's scholarship rates largely kept their losses after the disclosure of the data, with Hang Seng China Enterprisses, which brings together the main Chinese Hong Kong companies, losing 2.4 percent, and the CSI 300, which replicates the performance of the 300 main actions traded in the Shanghai and Shenzhen bags, to fall 0.8 percent.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:52:24</pubDate></item><item><title>AMCM | Foreign exchange reserves fall to 235.8 billion</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/amcm-reservas-cambiais-caem-para-os-2358-mil-milhoes/</link><description>At the end of March, MSAR currency reservations were heading at 235.8 billion patacas, which represented a 2.3 percent descent compared to February, according to the latest data from the Macao Monetary Authority (AMCM).

It is “Verses of Rain in Late Spring-New Media Art Exhibition” [Rain Verses In late Spring-New Media Art Exhibition] and presents works by five artists: Cindy Ng Sio Ieng, Kit Kit Kit Kit Kun, Chon Iap Lam and Xiaoqiao Li.
According to a press release released by the organization, artists “use digital photography, interactive digital sound installations, computerized painting and invisible paint” to make a new interpretation of the “ecological wisdom contained in the 24 solar terms”, creating a new artistic vocabulary.
In the same note it is described that the works exposed “simulate natural light and shadow effects through virtual lighting techniques, creating the aesthetics of spring beauty”. “Real -time sound data is also used to conduct facilities through which the public can experience the rhythm of coexistence” of all exposed elements.
This “interdisciplinary creation breaks with the traditional narrative forms of art, exploring issues of technology and sustainable development,” says the organization, which also says to “provide the public with a cyclical philosophical experience” based on rain power and the idea that “rain nourishes all grains”. Thus, "contemplation of the relationship between technology and nature is encouraged while appreciating art."
Various dimensions
Patent until May 28, this show was organized by the CAC - Circle of Macao Culture Friends, with Cindy Ng Sio Ieng as curator.
Cindy Ng Sio Ieng indicates that the exhibition refers to the final period of spring, "with the arrival of the" grain rain "station, when it reveals a poetry of its own season that" flows around the world. " In this show there are “virtual light and shadow that simulate the dance of nature”, while the use of sound data by artists in real time serves “to boost the rhythm of coexistence”.
In the case of artist Wang Tou Kun, born in Macau, digital photography is the means used to express itself artistically. Graduated from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, with specialization in digital media and photography, the artist expresses his personal experiences, both at the time and in the environment, and explores “the relationship between reality and virtual through digital media processing, in a concept that describes as 'post-photography'”.
In this show at the SCM Wang Tou Kun hostel presents “The Interconnected Nature Forest Shadow”, inspired by the very environment of the Patio do Albergue SCM, a space in the middle of the São Lazaro neighborhood, with old trees.
Assim, apresentam-se imagens “em camadas fluidas de tecido transparente”, em que as árvores espelham “sombras dançantes” e em que “as fissuras das paredes de tijolo e os veios das folhas” se interligam.
The artist also presents the series of images “9+2: Kunyu Wanguo Quantu”, focused on the 11 cities that make up the area of ​​the Great Bay. “Using website screen catches, the artist extensively collects images related to these cities,” then resorting to “digital collage techniques, skillfully fusing the screen captures to build a surreal landscape of interconnected cities,” the organization describes.
Chon Iap Lam, another participating artist, is a designer of theater lights and presents the work “Two-Dimensional Tree”, where he uses light and shadow facilities “to deconstruct the relationship between ancient trees and their shadows, as well as the two-dimensional and three-dimensional characteristics of the shadows”.
Thus, “in the dream space created by the installation of light, the audience can feel the shadows of the trees to swing, as if immersed in a transparent fabric forest, surrounded by several tree silhouettes,” describes the curator of the show. With this work, Chon Iap Lam shows "the professional experience in light design, reflecting his exploratory spirit in the field of digital art."
In turn, Xiaoqiao Li, a professor at the Hong Kong Metropolitan University Department of Creative Arts, presents digital animation work entitled “Phantom Terin: Landscapes Reimagined Through Gaussian Point Clouds”, where he employs 3D technology to create landscapes that explore the border between reality and virtual.
Already the artist Kit Lei Ka Ieng presents “Unfold”, an interactive work that “uses coding to allow plant growth patterns to change in response to musical melodies, transiting perfectly between the forms of water droplets and crystals”. The artist has been dedicated to multimedia art, focusing on digital images, sound installations and new media.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:33:02</pubDate></item><item><title>Traffic | Less road accidents in the first quarter</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/transito-menos-acidentes-rodoviarios-no-primeiro-trimestre/</link><description>In the first three months of 2025 there was a slight descent, 3.44 percent, of the number of road accidents, compared to 2024.

The co-founder of the Wynn Resorts Hotels and Casinos Group leaves a brand as a businesswoman, philanthropist and “tireless defender of Las Vegas, children and their education,” says the company that helped found

Lam Lon Wai wants to know when the government will prepare a bill to fully prohibit the use of electronic cigarettes. The issue is part of the latest written interpellation of the deputy linked to the Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom).
In the interpetement, the deputy indicates that "the latest inquiries" show that "Macao young people are increasingly using electronic cigarettes." In the optics of Lam Lon Wai, this type of cigarettes is dangerous because "it has been used for drug use in neighboring regions." Therefore, the deputy asks if the authorities will "do what they said before and propose new changes to the smoking control law."
Lam Lon Wai also asks the government to refer to what situation are the work to prohibit electronic cigarettes and to present a calendar for the approval of the measure and its entry into force.
Since 2022 a ban on entry or exit of the territory of electronic cigarettes is in force. Infringers risk paying a fine that can reach 4,000 patacas. However, if electronic cigarettes are in Macau can be used. And this is an aspect that Lam Lon Wai wants to see punished.
More Tobacco Free Areas
In order to control tobacco consumption, Lam Lon Wai also intends that the government advances with the creation of more cigarette -free areas near schools, hospitals and other public facilities.
"Residents are not satisfied with tobacco policies and say it is difficult to avoid passive smoke. They also expect authorities to continue to pay more attention, widening the zones of smoking and reinforcing advertising and law enforcement," wrote the legislator.
According to the deputy's proposal, health authorities should consider applying smoking prohibitions in places such as residential buildings, restaurants and busiest streets and even private cars, when they are children, as it says it is increasingly frequent in Hong Kong.
In addition to prohibitions, Lam suggests greater effort to help people smoke, with the creation of clinics and increasing inspection and punishment. "Especially with regard to the healthy growth of young people, it takes more preventive education about tobacco and alcohol […] and increasing young people's awareness of self -protection and we will establish a solid foundation for the project of a healthy macao," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:14:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Health | Government advances decision and promises to study early directive</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/saude-governo-adia-decisao-e-promete-estudar-directiva-antecipada/</link><description>The government considers that legislation to allow someone to give up receiving medical treatment will "face various problems." Therefore, it promises to continue to study the subject, without committing to any decision
 
The government considers that doing a law that allows people to abdicate in advance of receiving medical treatments before they have lost their ability to communicate will "face various problems." This is how the Institute of Social Action (IAS), through President Hon Wai, responded to an interpellation of Ho Ion Sang on the subject. However, the president of IAS considers that the work done so far to elaborate the new legislation were "positive".
The early directive, also known as an early decision or vital will, is a choice that can be taken by citizens to refuse some specific types of treatment in the future. A practical example of your application may be when a person is in brain death, but with vital functions only artificially ensured. The early directive may establish a person's will not be linked to the machines.
The choice is allowed in regions and countries such as Portugal, Spain, Germany, South Korea, Israel, Singapore, the United States, Canada, among others.
The question arises after Hong Kong legislated on the subject, and the Macao authorities put the possibility of advancing in this regard in 2021, including the creation of a study group.
However, in view of HO issues, the government considers that there are still no conditions [to submit the proposal of law], although preliminary legislative comparison work was “positive”.
What is that?
In the understanding of the authorities it is necessary to explain to the population the reach of the early directive, which is often unknown: “Given that the legislation on the creation of the 'early direction of will' will face several problems, namely, in terms of social concept and at the level of execution, health services plan to reinforce education and dissemination, in order to raise citizens' knowledge of 'early direction of will',” was communicated. “Alongside this, they plan to carry out, in collaboration with academic institutions, a study on the 'early directive of will', promoting, in an orderly manner, the respective works,” he was added.
It should be noted that the theme was addressed in the study “Advance Directives in Macao: Not Legally Recognissed, But.” [DAV in Macao: No legal recognition, but… ”, signed by Man Teng Iong, professor at the University of Macao Law School (one), and Vera Lúcia Raposo, former director of the same faculty and currently a teacher at the Faculty of Law of the New University of Lisbon.
In the same vein, the government guarantees that it will work with local associations so that the issue is discussed with the aim of achieving consensus.
In the document, authorities also argue that in recent years have reinforced efforts to ensure that palliative care at MSAR have increasingly responding to needs and better quality.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:10:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing, Hong Kong and Macau accuse the US of attacking China's survival</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/pequim-hong-kong-e-macau-acusam-eua-de-atacar-sobrevivencia-da-china/</link><description>The Chinese Communist Party's main official for Hong Kong and Macao affairs and governments of both regions yesterday accused the United States of imposing tariffs to sabotage China. "The US has targeted our tariffs, they target our own survival," said Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau affairs, under the tutelage of the State Council.
"Although Hong Kong is the largest source of US commercial surplus, the United States still imposed high tariffs. This is extremely arrogant and blatant," said Xia. "The US cannot tolerate Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and are the biggest sinister manipulator that undermines human rights, freedom, the rule of law, prosperity and stability in Hong Kong," the leader added.
Xia spoke in a pre-recorded speech, transmitted during the inauguration of an exhibition in Hong Kong, regarding the National Security Education Day. “Whoever tries to lead us back to poverty and weakness is our enemy,” warned the leader. "Those who betray national interests and cheer for the enemy at critical times will never be tolerated," he added.
Chief Words
Today, at the same ceremony, Hong Kong's government leader John Lee Ka-Chiu accused the United States of, in a "wicked logic," imposing tariffs to protect his "unhealthy hegemony." "The United States oppose free trade, interrupt global trade and supply chains (…), severely damaging the multilateral trade system and the process of globalization," said John Lee.
The chief executive has assured that Hong Kong "will keep his status from Porto Franco with basically null fees" and will file a complaint against the United States to the World Trade Organization.
Also the leader of the Macao government yesterday criticized the United States for the "abusive imposition of customs taxes on all its business partners," including China, "under several pretexts."

Graduated from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, with specialization in digital media and photography, the artist expresses his personal experiences, both at the time and in the environment, and explores “the relationship between reality and virtual through digital media processing, in a concept that describes as 'post-photography'”.
In this show at the SCM Wang Tou Kun hostel presents “The Interconnected Nature Forest Shadow”, inspired by the very environment of the Patio do Albergue SCM, a space in the middle of the São Lazaro neighborhood, with old trees.
Thus, there are images “in fluid layers of transparent fabric”, in which the trees mirror “dancing shadows” and “the cracks of the brick walls and the veins of the leaves” interconnect.
The artist also presents the series of images “9+2: Kunyu Wanguo Quantu”, focused on the 11 cities that make up the area of ​​the Great Bay. “Using website screen catches, the artist extensively collects images related to these cities,” then resorting to “digital collage techniques, skillfully fusing the screen captures to build a surreal landscape of interconnected cities,” the organization describes.
Chon Iap Lam, another participating artist, is a designer of theater lights and presents the work “Two-Dimensional Tree”, where he uses light and shadow facilities “to deconstruct the relationship between ancient trees and their shadows, as well as the two-dimensional and three-dimensional characteristics of the shadows”.
Thus, “in the dream space created by the installation of light, the audience can feel the shadows of the trees to swing, as if immersed in a transparent fabric forest, surrounded by several tree silhouettes,” describes the curator of the show. With this work, Chon Iap Lam shows "the professional experience in light design, reflecting his exploratory spirit in the field of digital art."
In turn, Xiaoqiao Li, a professor at the Hong Kong Metropolitan University Department of Creative Arts, presents digital animation work entitled “Phantom Terin: Landscapes Reimagined Through Gaussian Point Clouds”, where he employs 3D technology to create landscapes that explore the border between reality and virtual.
Already the artist Kit Lei Ka Ieng presents “Unfold”, an interactive work that “uses coding to allow plant growth patterns to change in response to musical melodies, transiting perfectly between the forms of water droplets and crystals”. The artist has been dedicated to multimedia art, focusing on digital images, sound installations and new media.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:33:02</pubDate></item><item><title>History | Book about Americans in Macao in the 19th century presented today</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/historia-livro-sobre-americanos-em-macau-no-seculo-xix-apresentado-hoje/</link><description>The book “To the Farthest Gulf for the Wealth of India - Macao Representations in the Peabody Essex Museum (Salem)”, by Rogério Miguel Puga, tells the story of Americans who lived in Macao in the nineteenth century. The Academic today presents in the Portuguese Bookstore the work that resulted from consultation with records stored in a museum in Salem, in the state of Massachusetts
 
Macao has long been a place of trade and experiences of people from around the world. One of the foreign communities that lived in the territory, in the busy nineteenth century, consisted of Americans, whose presence in Macao lasted in photographs, diaries, objects and paintings, present at the Peabody Essex Museum, in Salem, Massachusetts.
These signs of the ostentation of life, wealth and business that Americans had in the territory were the subject of analysis by Rogério Miguel Puga. The academic linked to New University of Lisbon launched, in 2023, a book that resulted from years of investigation into this theme, entitled “To the Farthest Gulf for the Wealth of India - Macao Representations at Peabody Essex Museum (Salem)”. The author presents today the work in Macau, from 18:30, in a session in the Portuguese Bookstore.
At HM, it tells a little about the long course of research and writing, which was supported by the Macau Foundation. "I started the book in Macao in 2009, but only in 2023 was released. It makes perfect sense to present the book in the city that is the subject of the investigation and where it was started."
The academic states that today's presentation in the Portuguese bookstore is “doubly symbolic” because there is a collaboration with Ciela, a research center of the University of Macau (one), where Rogério Miguel Puga has presented some lectures on the themes of the book, dynamized by professor Mário Pinharanda Nunes.
Today's session at the Portuguese Bookstore is moderate by Joshua Erlich, a professor at UM, “who also conducts research on the East India Company in India, thus communicating his work with my study on the British presence in Macau between 1635 and 1793, already published,” said Rogério Miguel Puga.
The author confesses that the event also symbolizes a return to a territory that has not visited since 2019 and where it always finds new topics to study. ” "This time, I focused on the Portuguese presence in Hong Kong, after visiting the exhibition 'Lusy Stories' at the Hong Kong Museum of History, which I will soon publish a reception in Portugal," he told HM.
The book presented today has been for sale at the Plaza Cultural Macau Bookstore, SENG KWong Bookstore (Starlight Bookstore) and the Macau Foundation's public information center.
Show Macau to the World
What objects were these and what did they serve? What useful did you have for Americans travelers in a time of rare and difficult communications? At a time when Macau was the only gateway to China, which did not allow residence to foreigners, they landed here to do business. Then, arrived in the US, showed Macao they had known.
Rogério Miguel Puga discovered this universe when he visited the museum in 2005. “I realized that in one of the museum rooms were several representations of Macau. I found the connection [from the territory] to Salem curious. It was a picture identified as Macau, but it was, in fact, a representation of Shanghai. and other artists, ”he said in an interview conducted in 2023.
At the Salem Museum there are objects such as fans, fitting tables, table tops, portraits, sewing tables with macao representations or portraits commissioned by Americans. Rogério Miguel Puga writes not only about these objects, but also about the historical context of the time, having also conducted research in cities such as New York, Philadelphia and Washington.
However, it also takes place today, between 2:45 pm and 4 pm, at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, the lecture “Anglo-Portuguese Relations and the British Presence in Macau (18th-19th centuries)”, the theme in the book. This is a session where we talk a little about the history of these western traders looking for Macao to do business with China, especially from 1700, when the Eastern Indian Company establishes direct trade relations with the country. In the lecture will also be mentioned the social and cultural interconnections that have taken place in these years between foreign traders and local populations.</description><pubDate>2025-04-16 01:27:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | Regulator accuses Google of violating anti -monopoly laws</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/japao-regulador-acusa-google-de-violar-leis-antimonopolio/</link><description>Japanese regulatory authorities accused US technology to violate anti-monopoly laws, referring to similar actions in the United States and Europe. Google Japan stated in a statement that it considered action “unfortunate” and the company said it has invested significantly in the country to promote innovation as a technological leader.
The “order of cessation and withdrawal” of Japan's Fair Trade Commission says Google has to stop the Google search engine preinstallation on Android smartphones, which, according to the commission, actually excludes the competition. It is not known if Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., based in Silicone Valley, USA, will take legal action to combat the order.
In the US, a judge decided last year that Google's “omnipresent” search engine illegally explored his dominance to master the competition. Google has denied the allegations, arguing that it is immensely popular because people like what it offers.
Japanese regulators began research on Google in 2023 and say they have consulted foreign authorities who dealt with similar cases. European regulators also criticized what they consider to be Google's monopolistic domain.
Tuesday's decision marks the first time that Japan's Fair Trade Commission takes action against a large world technological company.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:45:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Buses | New stop with the Mong Son Building</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/autocarros-nova-paragem-junto-ao-edificio-mong-son/</link><description>From tomorrow will be installed two new bus stops next to the Mong Son building, on Avenida de Venceslau de Morais, for seven careers. According to a note from the Directorate of Services for Traffic Affairs (DSAT), the new stops were organized taking into account "the entry of new residents in the Mong Son building and the travel needs."
Thus, the stop “Av. Venc. Morais / Edf. Mong Son” is located in front of Block 1 of the Mong Son building, while the “Edf. Mong Son” stop is on the inside of the building. Thus, seven bus careers circulating in the area will include these stops in their routes.
Also noteworthy is the fact that Careers 1a, towards Fai Chi Kei, career 10, for the doors of the siege; 28b, towards the Verde Island Terminal and 29, towards the Verde Island stop by the Mong Son building after stopping at “R.

April 15, 2025
Following the article in early April 2025, it is recalled that the new silk route is born in 2013 at the initiative of the current Chinese president, Xi Jinping, having been announced in Kazakhstan, initially with the six land corridors, later with a sea silk route and very recently with another sea route, the Polar Silk route, with the purpose of connecting Europe, Africa and Asia and, and, Asia and After all, also the rest of the world.
Let us also remember that according to experts in international and geopolitical relations, such as Professor Carlos Gaspar, the emergence of the new Silk Route, with its immense power of connection beyond chief, is part of a clear path of China, which gradually ascending the great power, first at the state level, then in economic terms and, lately, in the international domain.
Chinese connectivity power seems fully assumed and confirmed by the vice president of the Institute of Contemporary International Relations, Yuan Peng, in the theory of the three concentric rings or circles, which constitute the relational sphere of China: the inner ring of the 14 neighboring countries;  The intermediate ring that extends from the Pacific to the Indian and enabling in Central Asia and the outer ring that encompasses Africa, Europe, America and the two poles.
The question of knowing, following the words of Professor Carlos Gaspar, if the detected political, cultural, economic and technological connectivity does not presuppose existence in Chinese philosophical thinking of a principle of connectivity and, if so, when philosophies will be more active, or acts at the same levels in all philosophical currents.
The first part of the article was concluded, referring to the importance of Confucian Philosophy in the new Silk Route, as this is the philosophical softpower that accompanies the growth of the Chinese commercial network. Chinese links with the rest of the world are established on the basis of confusion principles solidly anchored in the Chinese tradition, dating back to the century according to BC, when Confucianism became the official ideology of the Chinese Empire by the hand of Dong Zhongshu (董仲舒, 179-104 BC), sustaining and justifying a meritocracy not only within China, but also throughout the world to the world to which The Chinese arrived and arrive. Thus, they are the five constant virtues (五常 wǔcháng): humanity (仁 Rén), justice (义 yì), rites (礼 lǐ), wisdom (智 zhì) and confidence (信 xìn), which allow, on the one hand, policy directly in ethics, enabling a good government to all Chinese on the basis of constant virtues, on the other, themselves Outside China, they are guided by Confucian virtues in the name of a harmoniously shared future. In Confucian philosophy, there is, therefore, at the level of an ethical-moral connectivity, which enables harmonious social relations, being the visible face of the principle of connectivity.
The principle under consideration may assume other facets if the optics go to philosophies providing cosmological and ontological explanations of existence, as is the case with Taoist philosophy. Here the principle of connectivity moves from society to ontology and cosmology. All beings without exception are linked to the same root where they emanate, never losing their ability, whether they differentiate themselves or to turn to each other, or to unify with the source from where we are informed by the alleged Patriarch of Taoism, Laozi (老子), in Chapter VI of the Book of Road and virtue, whose text in Chinese can be found in the translation of the work by António de Obeu (2013: 38):
 谷神不死
 是谓玄牝
 玄牝之门
 是谓天地根
 棉棉若存
 用之不勤
That I would like to translate as follows:
The spirit of the valley never dies,
To which it is called mysterious female,
The openings of this mysterious female
They are called the root of heaven and earth,
Existing uninterruptedly,
Without ever running out.
All living beings are linked to the same root, where they spring incessantly through heaven and earth. They emerge, differentiate each other, approach each other and can return to the origin if they are emptying the "having" to start the return movement that may lead to the total meeting, as explained to us in Chapter XL (Abreu, 2013, 106):
反者道之动
弱者道之用
天下万物 1 生于有
有生于无
That I translate as follows:
The return is the movement of the Tao,
The Tao is practiced by flexibility,
Everything that is born of having,
Having is born of not being.
It is then for the emptying, for the "not having" that is returned to the origin, but while you have, you are also, and you are maintaining relationships, the closer to Tao the more flexible they are. We coexist in interrelationship in an understanding that escapes language, being absolutely intuitive, only he can explain that beings are unharmed from certain relationships, at very negative departure, because they remain flexible and as empty as possible. Knowing how to live, on the basis of this constant interconnection, it is a virtue in itself that obtains as a reward the extension of the energy of life, as perceived by the following excerpt from Chapter L of the Book of Road and Virtue (Abreu, 2013, 126):
盖闻善摄生者
陆行不遇兕虎
人军不被甲兵
兕无所投其角
虎无所措其爪
兵无所容其刃
夫何故
以其无死地
Following is the concordant translation with the Grace of Abreu (2013,127)
I heard from the person who knows how to live,
When traveling through distant lands
Does not intersect with tigers or rhinos,
Will not be injured by military,
The rhinos cannot give you the horn,
The tigers can't stick to you the claws,
Neither the soldiers have the ability to stick to the swords.
Why is this person like this?
Because there is no room to die.
In fact, the one who cultivates life is, according to Taoist philosophy, simple, light humble, quite empty, flexible, so it offers neither space nor resistance to others, which usually happens to complicated, heavy, full, rigid spells.  So this person is in the ideal situation to create good relationships not only with other people, in Confucian way, as with all nature, in the Taoist way. The other animals, however fierce, recognize holiness, and other humans, even though they are well prepared for war, as is the case of the military, have no desire to do so, because they do not find any tip of aggressiveness or resistance in this being.
These intelligent and communicating ontology and cosmology extend to all nature, in the net, through the exercise and cultivation of the right virtues, which in the case of Taoism are compassion, frugality and simplicity, as communicated in the LXVII chapter of the classic of road and virtue (Abreu, 2013, 161), having been widely developed by Zhuangzi (庄子) (淮南子) 3.
In Zhuangzi, besides the best known examples such as “Zhuang Zhou4 dreamed that it was a butterfly” (庄周梦蝶) or “joy of fish” (鱼之乐), there are others like the “empty boat” (虚船), which indicate the correct way to be in networking, like a boat with no one to the rudder, so that when another boatman comes in our direction, even if it is possible, even if it is Insulted because our boat was inadvertently against his (Zhuangzi, 1999, 322-323), or “when the shoe adapts”, and it is true that the best shoe is always the older and comfortable, when the foot has stopped feeling the resistance of stiff and new material, which bothers and sometimes leaves blisters and even the footed foot and in living flesh.
Follow yourself to the emblematic story of Zhuangzi, translated here by me (1999.313):
工倕旋而盖规矩 ， 指与物化而不以心稽 ， 故其灵台一而不桎。忘足 ， 履之适也；忘腰 ， 带之适也；知忘是非 带之适也；知忘是非 心知适也；不内变 不外从 ， 事会之适也。始乎适而未尝不适者 ， 忘适之适也。
The artisan Chui was better to draw circles than those who wore ruler and square, his fingers transformed, without paying attention, moving them with great agility and to-vantade, as forgetting the foot when the shoe adapts; Forget the waist, when the belt adapts and forgets right and wrong when the heart adapts. When we adapt to the outside world there is no internal transformation, no external obligation. Being adapted, without feeling it, forgetting even being, is the true adaptation.
 The Taoist virtuous person is supremely kind, as is the water, which is the image of the supreme good in this philosophy, as is well known by Chapter VIII of the Book of the road and virtue (Abreu, 2013, 43). Water is described as giving life to everything that exists, running free everywhere, given its excellent adaptation power. It can be said that it is before an “existential Darwinism” Avant La Lettre, which is cultivated with simplicity and affability, constitutive virtues of the traditional Chinese person, to which, in the social dimension, all other confusion virtues, starting with humanity and justice, going through the rites and wisdom that culminates in trust. Uma pessoa que cultivou o seu carácter, para os taoistas de um modo quase inconsciente, para os confucionistas de uma maneira deliberada e concentrada, obtém como recompensa uma ligação essencial à vida, colocando-se na rede existencial na posição certa  para ativar a Ressonância Universal (感应gǎnyìng), que nos vem do Taoismo, nomeadamente de Huainanzi (淮南子), cuja dimensão espiritual é  muito forte e será complementada pela Buddhist philosophy that reread all beings through the image of the web of Indra, the deity of the natural forces that protects and nourishes life, having hung in his palace on Mount Meru a web of silk wires that unites us all in the similarity of a spider web, extending to infinity and connecting in all directions. Each of us is a precious jewel that reflects and is reflected, contacting all the others by reflection. And Buddha adds to his disciple that being interconnected, we must take good care of each other.
Taoists and Buddhists agree to this mysterious ontological connection, based on a communication to an intuitive, almost unconscious level, directly linked to the heart, in the case of Buddhists, who will certainly facilitate social relations, especially when they are fair, since this same connection can strongly punish those who exercise their power by strength, for example, in the work of the early Han-titled dynasty (《淮南子》 Huáinánzǐ), having been the sixth chapter translated by Canadian synologist Charles Le Blanc under the title Huainanzi 淮南子 Philosophical Synthesis in Early Han Thought, subtitled The Idea of ​​Resonance (Kan-Ying 感應) with the Translation and Analysis of Chapter Six. In the first section of Chapter VI, in the episode of the girl who complains to the skies of the abuses of the Duke Jing5 (京), this complains a devastating natural response that leads to the death of this buried gentleman, after a trim, in the rubble of his pavilion (Blanc, 1985, 103).
The enigmatic universal resonance makes it possible, if we think in terms of the Buddhist web equivalent to Tao, spirit of the valley, a mutual resonance (相应 Xiāngyìng), which for Taoists such as Huainanzi, depends on spontaneity, also called this philosopher “pure sincerity” (ī Jīngchéng) (Blanc, 1985, 107).  Resonance can be relative and mutual or absolute and universal when you can achieve a response from Tao's own, which, when seen as a musical instrument, is the note that rules all the others (Blanc, 1985, 138).
The Chinese person, who comes to the rest of the world through the various terrestrial and sea corridors of the new silk route (新丝绸之路 xīn sīchóu zhī lù) connecting of the whole on a vast network, does not do than reproduce ancient metaphors and images coming from the various Chinese philosophies. Today's Chinese seek relations in a world that have postulated interdependent and connected since they started their philosophical efforts, with physical records that go back to the highest Chinese antiquity, but began to be organized around the 6th century BC in the school of Mestre Confucius [孔子 (kǒngzǐ), 551-479 BC], being very close to other schools and already Taoist and already Taoist and already Taoist and In our age for the various types of assimilated Buddhism, believing many of them still in our days that Karma, the actions practiced, will be determining in the web of Indra not only for the present, but in the web of future reincarnations. And do not forget that actions are always in function of someone or something, and is therefore the essential connection for the progression in the future scale of being, which counts to the same measure with past lives and the present.
Finally, the Chinese, even if not confessed religious, land cruisers and seas navigators, similar to our 16th century compatriots, have negotiating a specific cultural heritage, which must be known to not fear and that rests on the principle of connectivity at the most diverse levels: cultural and philosophical, political and social, economic and commercial.

And to confirm the veracity of its existence, he adds that he heard recite his poems in stalage in the Hangzhou area.
Some even suggested that the poet would be a manufacture of one or more literati thus justifying the inexplicable ignorance of the life of the one who lived at a time that would precisely celebrate Li Qingzhao (1084 - c. 1155), Jinan's inspired literate (Shandong).
Among the various reasons that would explain such a different reception, the obvious literary environment and personal knowledge that benefited Li Qingzhao and that clearly was not the case of Zhu Shuzhen.
Beyond biographical doubts, her words persist showing a surprised look of the mutant and fleeting beauty she found before her eyes. As writes in the poem, fallen flowers: "Suspended at the top of the branches the first flowers emerge, pure, envying the flowers, the wind and the rain accelerate mutually, as it suits them."
And if in this regarding his gaze on nature, a sensitive personality is insinuated, when a Qing dynasty painter wanted to portray a prominent literate who occupied important functions in the imperial government, he thought of a landscape elected in a garden. In the horizontal roll (ink on paper, 34.8 x 90 cm, in Metmuseum) where the speech about Song Luo's poetry is locked by his son Song Zhi, the painter made the figure of a literate sitting in an open pavilion surrounded by two people, representing someone who lives in community. But it is the high pines, a low stream, a profusion of bamboo, metaphors of a high, righteous character that occupy most of the painted space.
Gao Jian (1634-1707), the painter of Maoyuan (Suzhou), shows in this painting of the autumn of 1698, the style that characterized his city, evoking namely Shen Zhou (1427-1509), the respected master of the so-called “Wu School», alternative name of the region of Suzhou. In another painting Gao Jian referred to it by the name doing, as he did, a painting of a landscape "in the way of". In the vertical roll (paint and color on paper, 208.9 x 93.9 cm, at the Indianapolis Museum of Art) wrote "in May the river is deep and the pavilion is cold", citing a verse of du fu.

Trying to save the history of his great traditions, to phenomenology, Heidegger does not escape an idealistic waste, as if the things of the world belonged to her, history, and to one course course, Bragança de Miranda tells us.
For Benjamin, in his search for a tangible surface of time -contaminated objects, what was concerned was surely the haptic drilling we found in Caravaggio and Fontana - the latter bringing to the artistic object a clearly performative gesture and - as in everything that happens in here and now - capable of recreating or inspiring chaos on such artistic things. Things that no longer offer themselves in a harmonious course and do not belong - neither history nor aesthetics, but to the world like the stones or words that jump to us from the mouth.
Somehow surpassing the Barthiano Punctum, Benjamin's dialectical image escapes the “historicity” that offers itself as a sacred altar where the things of art
They are eternalized - teleologically - in another world where the conditions of the world do not feel - where it is supposed that nothing is lost, ruin, or transforms into the essence of things, and of works, in this case of the work of art.
What matters to Benjamin echoes disturbingly in Duchamp, because in the shift between the past, the present and the future, the things done beings that capture in the act of making their power, is that the possibility of belonging to a certain time, expands in the gesture in which the work affects its own historicity, and can be read at any time. It indicates the possibility of your time and the power of your reception at any time. It is a kronotopic and anmorphic boomerangue. Infixed from the moment it is fixed. As Benjamin said, he seize something, the moment the danger shines, is fatal. However, he referred to the power of myth, which here promisedly belong to those who venture to steal fire to the gods-punishment is the esventtation and cannibalism of others, and can read in the world, in the universe, in the universe, and that we do not know the limits, although we can guess them.
For Benjamin, therefore, things and works done by artists can only ecist in an image that sparkles as a star, which is seen according to the conditions and the means, and which is part of a network, a puzzle, or, better, taking advantage of its own essayist methodical - in a constellation.
I love to remember the geometry of the sky to know where the largest bear is the smaller bear. Looking at the sky, this huge ecran of moving images, images that appear and disappear on the huge skin of the world, because we no longer see beyond it, even knowing that there is more. That there is an entire universe of possibilities. We, who do and those who come, touch or enjoy the performance and effects of doing, are - how to say - the bowels within this huge body that is the world.
And we want to repeat it on our small gestures of artists, and have both impact and the extraordinary show of heaven, the shadows, the sea… and how do we do it? Seeking to create images that express time in your space, without contaminating themselves for it. Leaving it loose. Allowing us to doubt our acts that are no longer eternal or belong to history, but they are part of an incredible file of possibilities: we can all do, but not all have the effect of affecting the world and somehow causing inconvenience.
From the collection of possibility, the archive of all times and spaces, all dreams and ways of making, of all sensitivities comes the inflamed object of originality-the one whose form we do not yet recognize, the one who re-crack, dearrange, alters… He who invites a time to sit to play plaid with another time. And such a sharing of the sensitive, of which Rancière tells us, is difficult. As difficult as we have the same image of the world.
I believe these things - which few come because they do not recognize the new aspect, and that contemporary in the immense liberation of exclusionary norms, can have any form, leads us to a reversal of Gestalt's theory: it is no longer possible to share anything - not even the world and its grand skin, the blue sky of Bataille. Ricoeur's great evil devours the eyes of the corpses and the possible image is that of a survival kit in the absence of a nuclear war pavorods on the world.
As Agamben warns us, the contemporary gesture starts from the urgency to respond. What answer bring us images of all time if we believe there is no survival kit for art? She is always changing - touched by the grace of the appearance, she is decaying like everything inside the world. Like light… that today we rip out of the machine and technique in an agronic aesthetic commotion to see when the world gets around existence.
What remains, for now, is the hammer, to the shiver of time, without the wicked truth, very nietzschianly acting that we all try to do our part, knowing the look of the look that all sees. Increasingly aware that things of art cannot escape you after the bruschiness of your birth, in disturbing objects that increasingly interfere with the state of things, remembering a wonderful Wenders movie, the artists authors, those who affect and alter the appearance of the appearance of the work of art, such as Duchamp, are real estate travelers who drop objects-image that speaks. Shout. Fight. Fly to the sky. They fall and explode politically the land where we live where all that exists is the image - this is the constant matter that emanates from the act of doing things - artistic or not.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Zhu Shuzhen (c.1135-1180), the Poet of the Song Dynasty whose biography is known only through the preface written by Wei Duanli (1130- C. 1184) in the collection of his poems Duanchang Shiji, "Heart Heart", where he says that A did not personally know only a biography of it made by such a Wang Tanzuo.

Among the various reasons that would explain such a different reception, the obvious literary environment and personal knowledge that benefited Li Qingzhao and that clearly was not the case of Zhu Shuzhen.
Beyond biographical doubts, her words persist showing a surprised look of the mutant and fleeting beauty she found before her eyes. As writes in the poem, fallen flowers: "Suspended at the top of the branches the first flowers emerge, pure, envying the flowers, the wind and the rain accelerate mutually, as it suits them."
And if in this regarding his gaze on nature, a sensitive personality is insinuated, when a Qing dynasty painter wanted to portray a prominent literate who occupied important functions in the imperial government, he thought of a landscape elected in a garden. In the horizontal roll (ink on paper, 34.8 x 90 cm, in Metmuseum) where the speech about Song Luo's poetry is locked by his son Song Zhi, the painter made the figure of a literate sitting in an open pavilion surrounded by two people, representing someone who lives in community. But it is the high pines, a low stream, a profusion of bamboo, metaphors of a high, righteous character that occupy most of the painted space.
Gao Jian (1634-1707), the painter of Maoyuan (Suzhou), shows in this painting of the autumn of 1698, the style that characterized his city, evoking namely Shen Zhou (1427-1509), the respected master of the so-called “Wu School», alternative name of the region of Suzhou. In another painting Gao Jian referred to it by the name doing, as he did, a painting of a landscape "in the way of". In the vertical roll (paint and color on paper, 208.9 x 93.9 cm, at the Indianapolis Museum of Art) wrote "in May the river is deep and the pavilion is cold", citing a verse of du fu. After all inscribing his work in a continuum of singular voices that follow himself in time and to which the observer reader is invited to listen, even unaware of details of the authors' biography that are lost as flowers impelled by wind and rain in the middle of spring.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves, auxiliary researcher and coordinator of the CCCM Educational Service
April 15, 2025
Following the article in early April 2025, it is recalled that the new silk route is born in 2013 at the initiative of the current Chinese president, Xi Jinping, having been announced in Kazakhstan, initially with the six land corridors, later with a sea silk route and very recently with another sea route, the Polar Silk route, with the purpose of connecting Europe, Africa and Asia and, and, Asia and After all, also the rest of the world.
Let us also remember that according to experts in international and geopolitical relations, such as Professor Carlos Gaspar, the emergence of the new Silk Route, with its immense power of connection beyond chief, is part of a clear path of China, which gradually ascending the great power, first at the state level, then in economic terms and, lately, in the international domain.
Chinese connectivity power seems fully assumed and confirmed by the vice president of the Institute of Contemporary International Relations, Yuan Peng, in the theory of the three concentric rings or circles, which constitute the relational sphere of China: the inner ring of the 14 neighboring countries;  The intermediate ring that extends from the Pacific to the Indian and enabling in Central Asia and the outer ring that encompasses Africa, Europe, America and the two poles.
The question of knowing, following the words of Professor Carlos Gaspar, if the detected political, cultural, economic and technological connectivity does not presuppose existence in Chinese philosophical thinking of a principle of connectivity and, if so, when philosophies will be more active, or acts at the same levels in all philosophical currents.
The first part of the article was concluded, referring to the importance of Confucian Philosophy in the new Silk Route, as this is the philosophical softpower that accompanies the growth of the Chinese commercial network. Chinese links with the rest of the world are established on the basis of confusion principles solidly anchored in the Chinese tradition, dating back to the century according to BC, when Confucianism became the official ideology of the Chinese Empire by the hand of Dong Zhongshu (董仲舒, 179-104 BC), sustaining and justifying a meritocracy not only within China, but also throughout the world to the world to which The Chinese arrived and arrive. Thus, they are the five constant virtues (五常 wǔcháng): humanity (仁 Rén), justice (义 yì), rites (礼 lǐ), wisdom (智 zhì) and confidence (信 xìn), which allow, on the one hand, policy directly in ethics, enabling a good government to all Chinese on the basis of constant virtues, on the other, themselves Outside China, they are guided by Confucian virtues in the name of a harmoniously shared future. In Confucian philosophy, there is, therefore, at the level of an ethical-moral connectivity, which enables harmonious social relations, being the visible face of the principle of connectivity.
The principle under consideration may assume other facets if the optics go to philosophies providing cosmological and ontological explanations of existence, as is the case with Taoist philosophy. Here the principle of connectivity moves from society to ontology and cosmology. All beings without exception are linked to the same root where they emanate, never losing their ability, whether they differentiate themselves or to turn to each other, or to unify with the source from where we are informed by the alleged Patriarch of Taoism, Laozi (老子), in Chapter VI of the Book of Road and virtue, whose text in Chinese can be found in the translation of the work by António de Obeu (2013: 38):
 谷神不死
 是谓玄牝
 玄牝之门
 是谓天地根
 棉棉若存
 用之不勤
That I would like to translate as follows:
The spirit of the valley never dies,
To which it is called mysterious female,
The openings of this mysterious female
They are called the root of heaven and earth,
Existing uninterruptedly,
Without ever running out.
All living beings are linked to the same root, where they spring incessantly through heaven and earth. They emerge, differentiate each other, approach each other and can return to the origin if they are emptying the "having" to start the return movement that may lead to the total meeting, as explained to us in Chapter XL (Abreu, 2013, 106):
反者道之动
弱者道之用
天下万物 1 生于有
有生于无
That I translate as follows:
The return is the movement of the Tao,
The Tao is practiced by flexibility,
Everything that is born of having,
Having is born of not being.
It is then for the emptying, for the "not having" that is returned to the origin, but while you have, you are also, and you are maintaining relationships, the closer to Tao the more flexible they are. We coexist in interrelationship in an understanding that escapes language, being absolutely intuitive, only he can explain that beings are unharmed from certain relationships, at very negative departure, because they remain flexible and as empty as possible. Knowing how to live, on the basis of this constant interconnection, it is a virtue in itself that obtains as a reward the extension of the energy of life, as perceived by the following excerpt from Chapter L of the Book of Road and Virtue (Abreu, 2013, 126):
盖闻善摄生者
陆行不遇兕虎
人军不被甲兵
兕无所投其角
虎无所措其爪
兵无所容其刃
夫何故
以其无死地
Following is the concordant translation with the Grace of Abreu (2013,127)
I heard from the person who knows how to live,
When traveling through distant lands
Does not intersect with tigers or rhinos,
Will not be injured by military,
The rhinos cannot give you the horn,
The tigers can't stick to you the claws,
Neither the soldiers have the ability to stick to the swords.
Why is this person like this?
Because there is no room to die.
In fact, the one who cultivates life is, according to Taoist philosophy, simple, light humble, quite empty, flexible, so it offers neither space nor resistance to others, which usually happens to complicated, heavy, full, rigid spells.  So this person is in the ideal situation to create good relationships not only with other people, in Confucian way, as with all nature, in the Taoist way. The other animals, however fierce, recognize holiness, and other humans, even though they are well prepared for war, as is the case of the military, have no desire to do so, because they do not find any tip of aggressiveness or resistance in this being.
These intelligent and communicating ontology and cosmology extend to all nature, in the net, through the exercise and cultivation of the right virtues, which in the case of Taoism are compassion, frugality and simplicity, as communicated in the LXVII chapter of the classic of road and virtue (Abreu, 2013, 161), having been widely developed by Zhuangzi (庄子) (淮南子) 3.
In Zhuangzi, besides the best known examples such as “Zhuang Zhou4 dreamed that it was a butterfly” (庄周梦蝶) or “joy of fish” (鱼之乐), there are others like the “empty boat” (虚船), which indicate the correct way to be in networking, like a boat with no one to the rudder, so that when another boatman comes in our direction, even if it is possible, even if it is Insulted because our boat was inadvertently against his (Zhuangzi, 1999, 322-323), or “when the shoe adapts”, and it is true that the best shoe is always the older and comfortable, when the foot has stopped feeling the resistance of stiff and new material, which bothers and sometimes leaves blisters and even the footed foot and in living flesh.
Follow yourself to the emblematic story of Zhuangzi, translated here by me (1999.313):
工倕旋而盖规矩 ， 指与物化而不以心稽 ， 故其灵台一而不桎。忘足 ， 履之适也；忘腰 ， 带之适也；知忘是非 带之适也；知忘是非 心知适也；不内变 不外从 ， 事会之适也。始乎适而未尝不适者 ， 忘适之适也。
The artisan Chui was better to draw circles than those who wore ruler and square, his fingers transformed, without paying attention, moving them with great agility and to-vantade, as forgetting the foot when the shoe adapts; Forget the waist, when the belt adapts and forgets right and wrong when the heart adapts. When we adapt to the outside world there is no internal transformation, no external obligation. Being adapted, without feeling it, forgetting even being, is the true adaptation.
 The Taoist virtuous person is supremely kind, as is the water, which is the image of the supreme good in this philosophy, as is well known by Chapter VIII of the Book of the road and virtue (Abreu, 2013, 43). Water is described as giving life to everything that exists, running free everywhere, given its excellent adaptation power. It can be said that it is before an “existential Darwinism” Avant La Lettre, which is cultivated with simplicity and affability, constitutive virtues of the traditional Chinese person, to which, in the social dimension, all other confusion virtues, starting with humanity and justice, going through the rites and wisdom that culminates in trust. Uma pessoa que cultivou o seu carácter, para os taoistas de um modo quase inconsciente, para os confucionistas de uma maneira deliberada e concentrada, obtém como recompensa uma ligação essencial à vida, colocando-se na rede existencial na posição certa  para ativar a Ressonância Universal (感应gǎnyìng), que nos vem do Taoismo, nomeadamente de Huainanzi (淮南子), cuja dimensão espiritual é  muito forte e será complementada pela Buddhist philosophy that reread all beings through the image of the web of Indra, the deity of the natural forces that protects and nourishes life, having hung in his palace on Mount Meru a web of silk wires that unites us all in the similarity of a spider web, extending to infinity and connecting in all directions. Each of us is a precious jewel that reflects and is reflected, contacting all the others by reflection. And Buddha adds to his disciple that being interconnected, we must take good care of each other.
Taoists and Buddhists agree to this mysterious ontological connection, based on a communication to an intuitive, almost unconscious level, directly linked to the heart, in the case of Buddhists, who will certainly facilitate social relations, especially when they are fair, since this same connection can strongly punish those who exercise their power by strength, for example, in the work of the early Han-titled dynasty (《淮南子》 Huáinánzǐ), having been the sixth chapter translated by Canadian synologist Charles Le Blanc under the title Huainanzi 淮南子 Philosophical Synthesis in Early Han Thought, subtitled The Idea of ​​Resonance (Kan-Ying 感應) with the Translation and Analysis of Chapter Six. In the first section of Chapter VI, in the episode of the girl who complains to the skies of the abuses of the Duke Jing5 (京), this complains a devastating natural response that leads to the death of this buried gentleman, after a trim, in the rubble of his pavilion (Blanc, 1985, 103).
The enigmatic universal resonance makes it possible, if we think in terms of the Buddhist web equivalent to Tao, spirit of the valley, a mutual resonance (相应 Xiāngyìng), which for Taoists such as Huainanzi, depends on spontaneity, also called this philosopher “pure sincerity” (ī Jīngchéng) (Blanc, 1985, 107).  Resonance can be relative and mutual or absolute and universal when you can achieve a response from Tao's own, which, when seen as a musical instrument, is the note that rules all the others (Blanc, 1985, 138).
The Chinese person, who comes to the rest of the world through the various terrestrial and sea corridors of the new silk route (新丝绸之路 xīn sīchóu zhī lù) connecting of the whole on a vast network, does not do than reproduce ancient metaphors and images coming from the various Chinese philosophies. Today's Chinese seek relations in a world that have postulated interdependent and connected since they started their philosophical efforts, with physical records that go back to the highest Chinese antiquity, but began to be organized around the 6th century BC in the school of Mestre Confucius [孔子 (kǒngzǐ), 551-479 BC], being very close to other schools and already Taoist and already Taoist and already Taoist and In our age for the various types of assimilated Buddhism, believing many of them still in our days that Karma, the actions practiced, will be determining in the web of Indra not only for the present, but in the web of future reincarnations. And do not forget that actions are always in function of someone or something, and is therefore the essential connection for the progression in the future scale of being, which counts to the same measure with past lives and the present.
Finally, the Chinese, even if not confessed religious, land cruisers and seas navigators, similar to our 16th century compatriots, have negotiating a specific cultural heritage, which must be known to not fear and that rests on the principle of connectivity at the most diverse levels: cultural and philosophical, political and social, economic and commercial.

However, it warned of economic difficulties
 
In the first lines and government action he presented to the population of Macau, Sam Hou Fai announced the creation of a new childhood allowance that will assign a maximum and 18,000 patacas per year to children under three years. In the Legislative Assembly, the Chief Executive revealed the creation of a new social support and the updating of others, underlined that the government places the well-being of the population as the great priority.
Although it has only mentioned the “mitigation of population concerns” such as the third priority of the government's policies, behind other aspects such as the diversification of the economy and the efficiency of governance in the MSAR, Sam ensured that the population is the first priority: “The well-being of the population is fundamental. This government will persist in placing the interests of the population first and, taking into account the subjects related to their daily life, to solve the real problems. More pressing, with a view to responding to their aspirations for a quality life, ”he promised.
As part of this policy, Sam Hou Fai has announced the support changes that are mainly intended to promote the increase in the birth rate and to support the elderly population or with special needs.
At birth, the big news was the creation of the “childhood assistance subsidy” that will assign to each permanent resident child up to three years old an amount of 1,500 patacas per month, which can reach a maximum of 18 thousand patacas per year. This incentive is added an increase of 1,082 patacas from the birth subsidy, which rises from current 5,418 patacas to 6,500 patacas. Also the marriage subsidy is increased by 78 patacas, 2,122 patacas to 2,220 patacas.
For the elderly
At the level of support for the elderly, the elderly subsidy is increased by 1,000 patacas, rising from the maximum annual amount of 9,000 to 10,000 patacas.
At the same time, the pension for the elderly is updated from a monthly amount of 3,740 per month to 3,900 patacas per month, a difference of 160 patacas per month. As this pension is paid thirteen times throughout the year, the maximum amount rises 2,080 patacas, from current 48,620 patacas to 50,700 patacas.
Regarding residents with disability, normal allowance will be increased to 10,000 patacas per year, compared to current 9,000 patacas. The special disability allowance has a larger increase from the current 18,000 patacas to 20,000 patacas, a difference of 2,000 patacas.
Another of the news is an update of health valleys, which will rise to 700 patacas, when they are currently 600 patacas.
Economics warnings
At the economy level, although without ever mentioning the new trade war between the United States and China, the chief executive warned that the Economy of the MSAR will not pass unscathed, although it can count on the interior market. "We have witnessed, in recent years, the aggravation of unilateralism and protectionism, the insufficiency of dynamics prone to world economic growth, as well as the increase of unforeseen events and uncertainties," he said.
"Deep and complex changes in the internal and external environment have already manifested and will persist, so Macau, as a microeconomic strongly turned outside, could not be immune to the resulting impacts," he added. "For all this, we should not underestimate any threats and challenges, before, we must always be aware of the risks and a sense of warning, so that we are prepared to act against all potential threats," he warned.
Sam Hou Fai also acknowledged that the current revenues are below the expected and that there may be a need to have a reformulation of the mashed budget in force.
In terms of economy support, the government leader has announced a bank credit bonus plan for small and medium enterprises, which will allow entrepreneurs to obtain up to 4 percent of loan interest rates for three years of a maximum of 5 million PATACA. The maximums of bonusted total loans cannot exceed 10 billion patacas.
Checks with “Requirements”
In yesterday's presentation, Sam Hou Fai said that the amounts paid in the pecuniary checks will remain, ensuring that the pecuniary reimbursement program should be changed, without being announced which. "After the hell of the opinions of all sectors of the company, the improvement of a monetary regime will be performed, using savings in expenses to increase the welfare of residents and promote the development of the community economy." In the same session it was mentioned that the money is attributed to residents “who meet the requirements”, so it remains to know what these requirements will be.
Focus on terrorism
In the lag presented yesterday by Sam Hou Fai National Security had a lower prominence in the face of the speeches of Ho IAT SENG. Still, it has been indicated that for this year the reformulation of the State Security Defense Commission will be studied and new laws will be thought of to combat terrorism. In the context of nationalism, framed in the chapter of national security, it was explained that the government will further support associations considered as patriotic, while events will be organized to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the War Victory against Japan.
Cash reform
At the public administration level, the Chief Executive announced that he will submit a proposal to reformulate the Institute for Municipal Affairs. The bill must enter the Legislative Assembly by the end of the year. The changes have not been detailed, but the great goal is to "simplify the organic structure of the government and raise the efficiency of its functioning." Also the Directorate of Administration and Public Services will be reformulated this year. In addition, Sam Hou Fai has promised that civil servants will begin to oath loyalty.

"Flowers of Gray" ends the trilogy of works dedicated to Macau, composed of "flowered by mistake the angry roses" and "Nomadic Words"
 
It was ten years that translated into many words. So many, who gave three books, “they were mistakenly flowered to the angry roses”, clearly reference to Camilo Pessanha; “Nomadic Words” and now “Gray Flowers”. Dora Nunes Gago's new poetry book, a teacher and former director of the Portuguese Department of Macao (one), also refers to Macau who lasts in his memory and, therefore, translates into words.
With the seal of Humus, the book has just left Portugal, resulting from the "many poems" written by Dora Nunes Gago during the period in Macao, an experience that turned her into an published and award -winning author.
Writing poetry in these years of teaching and experience the East turned out to be the way found to deal with Macau's reviliations and their dynamics. “Perhaps because it is a shorter record, a way to capture moments, of crystallizing them, in the midst of all the bullshit and surprises that Macau dresses. Maria Ondina Braga referred to the work“ Statue de Sal ”, written in Macao, around 1963, that Macau is 'sleep of sleep and poetry'. Hm.
“Gray Flowers” ​​is called because he went to seek inspiration from a poem by Natália Correia: “(…) young people oblivious to the pulcitude of the body in celebration / pass me as cypresses of cypresses / And the youth gray flower is an edge / strike me by opening vacuums of wild flowers (…) / the gallop in a teeth foam.”
Dora Nunes Gago selected the “surviving poems” of the remaining two titles of the trilogy. “There were those who were lost, between changes, travel, blocks and lost notebooks.” Like the whole macao's own revocation.
In "Gray Flowers," the territory "is represented by rituals, the symbolic times like the Chinese New Year, which is that festive time when the world is reborn and inventing itself." There are also elements that become poetry such as the dumplings, the temples, the island of Hengqin, where the author lived in the days she taught at one.
“The territory is present in the images, but also in the solitude and silence that inhabits the poems, all of them very short. In this book, my obsession with synthesis culminated,” he describes.
Each book, a message
There are poems that speak for themselves, others who need to be explained. And speaking of the trilogy he has written in recent years, Dora Nunes Gago refers to the first, where the pessanha symbolism is sought and where he denotes "the first look at Asia and Macao."
Here there is no poetry, but 24 tales, "many of them inspired by witnessed stories, heard or read in newspapers." Already the award -winning “Nomadic Words”, winner of the Grand Travel Literature Prize Maria Ondina Braga last year, contains 50 chronicles. "It was the way to find a guiding thread to unite various experiences and learning that had a conductive thread for my life."
Behold, in the last book of the trilogy, 55 poems, organized into three parts, namely “exhibitions, permanences and returns” are gathered. They are “a synthesis of all my route,” he says. “Gray Flowers” ​​is “Perhaps the most autobiographical book of the three, as it is rooted in multiple feelings, in a kind of instantaneous ones that configured my days,” says the author.
From the preface, by Maria João Cantinho, it is read that the first of the trilogy, “flowered by mistake the Brave roses” is “a book of brief stories, whose title was taken from loan to a beautiful verse (and a poem) of the melancholy Camilo Pessanha, in Clepsidra”. While "nomadic words" brings together chronic chronicles that are born "from his experience in Macao, as well as his traveler and adventurous aspect, as the Teotónio Almeida needed very praised." In turn, in the third, Dora Gago "changes the record and we find ourselves in the face of poetic and sensitive writing, built by brief poems," he reads.
Maria João Cantinho also understands that the poem “Destiny” is one of the most beautiful in “Flowers of Gray”: “In the crazy run / of the abandoned / lonely Galgo of existing, lick the wounds of death / in the skin of the poem.”
Here, it is described “poetic writing is presented as vertigo (‘ in the crazy race ’) driven by a allegorical impetus, in which the presence of death emerges”, where “fate is certainly this disadvantaged race in which death surrounds the living and only the poem can save or redeem those”, considers Maria João Cantinho.
For this, "Dora Nunes Gago's writing contains a reflective dimension, addressing topics such as the creation or passage of time, among many others, and using a rich, vocabulary and prosodic level language in the search for effects that accentuate the tension of the poem."
“Exiles”, the first part of the work, starts with “beginning”, a simple name for a short poem: “I follow the memory footprints / inscribed in the sand of time / and I am a ship / anchored without leme / no breath”. Perhaps marked by longing and distance, we find “absence”: “They dance solemn ashes / Silvando Winds of Saudade, / Heavens / Spelled / In Blood / Solitude.”
And as this book is made of comings and goings, the work ends with "return", as if it was a timeline: "Returning the house / tattooing hills and valleys / in the retina, / watering the flowers of gray / reborn / in stony cracks / of hope."
Dora Nunes Gago is a native of São Brás de Alportel and is currently a teacher at the Setúbal Polytechnic Institute. About “Nomadic Words”, the Jury of the Grand Prix of Travel Literature Maria Ondina Braga, granted by the Portuguese Writers Association (APE), considered it to be a “work of varied and rich observations concerning the places where the reports of great sensory livelihood, which do not lack the intimate look at places and people designating as 'Génie du Lieu' ”.
"In a prose of great fluidity, eavized of reflections where perceptions, memories, culture, literature and history are intersected, the author has been able to lead a reading reading from the first pages, whose rhythm and interest can maintain throughout the considerable extension of the work," said the same jury.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>LAG 2025 | Checks, economy and great bay should be sam hu fai bets</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/lag-2025-cheques-economia-e-grande-baia-devem-ser-apostas-de-sam-hou-fai/</link><description>The government lines for this year are presented on Monday, marking the debut of Sam Hou Fai in one of the most anticipated moments of the local political calendar. Game recipes and economic predictions should be on the table, according to José Sales Marques and Lou Shenghua. The future of pecuniary checks may be another matter to be in attention
 
Sam Hou Fai has been in the government for almost five months and is preparing to present, next Monday, his first report of the Governing Action Lines (LAG) for this year. Great expectations often reside in the amounts of pecuniary checks, the values ​​attributed to social support and other budgetary predictions, especially after the territory has been through a hard economic period with Covid-19.
LAG 2025 should focus on these themes, and Macao's integration into the various regional cooperation projects, such as Hengqin Island or the Great Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay. Fulfilling the annual tradition of local politics, Sam Hou Fai made the usual round of auscultations to local associations, in order to know his opinions on the main measures to take.
Listened to by HM, economist José Sales Marques expects clarity in the policies announced at the economic level. "I would like to see these LAG bring greater clarity on economic policies and the vision for the future of MSAR. I speak of structural measures that encourage the trust of the private investor, and that also realize such reforms of public administration to increase efficiency and effectiveness," he said.
Sales Marques also said that "I would like to clearly see Macao's positions and priorities in his relationship with countries and regions of the world, including measures that lead to deepen the role of Sino-Midfone Platform and the Base of Multicultural Dialogue."
Lou Shenghua, a political analyst and professor at Macao Polytechnic University (UPM), said the main ideas presented will be in accordance with what Sam Hou Fai presented in the electoral program. "The tonic can be placed in improving the effectiveness of governance, moderate economic diversification, the construction of the Hengqin cooperation zone and the issues related to the subsistence means of people," said the analyst, stressing that "citizens may be more concerned with subsistence -related issues."
And what program presented Sam Hou Fai in September last year, when it was glimpsed that he would be the only candidate for the position of Chief Executive? A program that has as its “maximum objective to meet citizens' expectations for a better life” and the “fundamental orientation of implementing the principle of a country, two systems” in a full, correct and firm way ”. The importance of national security was not forgotten, referring to the need for defense “of sovereignty, security and interests of the country's development”. About the sin, Sam Hou Fai said he wanted to erect a "macao based on the rule of law, dynamic, cultural and happy."
The then only candidate to head the government promised to improve the government's governing capacity. "We will strive to raise the capacity and level of governance of MSAR, the change in the concepts of governance, the optimization of the form of governance, the persistence of macao governance in accordance with the law, and the deepening of the reform of public administration and the legal system."
Thus, he said "optimizing forms of governance, giving greater importance to the role of advisory bodies, experts and academics, and love associations of the country and Macao, widely listening to the opinions and suggestions of various sectors, different industry branches and various social strata." It remains to be seen if the lag will bring these tin aspects to the field of actions and concrete measures.
MATE
On Monday, the agenda continues as usual in the presentation of a report of the lag. First Sam Hou Fai will go to the Legislative Assembly, from 15h, make a general presentation to the deputies of political and budgetary issues essential for this year, followed by a press conference.
The next day, it is a day of debate in the hemicycle on the same report, then followed the sectoral debates with all secretaries until the 30th of this month.
One of the political themes that have been in the DAY ORDER is the value of pecuniary checks and whether or not they are attributed to residents living outside Macao. There are analysts to defend the reformulation of the program, but Sales Marques recalls that "the amount expected for pecuniary checks in the budget discussion for 2025 is 10,000 patacas for permanent residents."
“Predicted budget revenues were based on calculation a gross revenue forecast of 240 billion patacas to an average of 20 billion per month. It turns out that the effective revenues obtained until the end of the first quarter of this year were short, with a deviation of less than four billion. be hit. ”
Given these less optimistic predictions, referred to by the Secretary himself for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP last week, Sales Marques believes that, if there are adjustments in the checks, will be "small". "As for the distribution method, I predict that it remains the same," he said.
Lou Shenghua believes that "the pecuniary reimbursement plan may change." "In terms of amount, it is likely to maintain the value of ten thousand patacas per resident, but as for the form, it can be attributed to consumer valleys," he said.
Last day 1, Secretary Tai Kin IP said the budget accounts are still short of expected. "We noticed that in the first three months of 2025 the gross revenues of the games reached 57.66 billion patacas, remaining the value almost unchanged annually, not yet reaching the expected monthly average of 20 billion patacas."
Thus, it was left the warning that "this year's financial revenues may not be as optimistic as it is expected", and it is necessary to "seriously study the future economic situation and persist in the management of financial resources with prudence."
Game and other stories
Regarding the game sector, which has continued to have a predominant weight in the economy, Sam Hou Fai confirmed a month ago that concessionaires and satellite casinos have until the end of the year to prepare the transition to a subconsers' exploration model. It will be in the "hands" of the dealers to decide whether or not to explore these casinos directly.
For Sales Marques, this dossier “worries several sectors of society, not only about the use of its workers, but also for the repercussion that will close in the areas of the city where they are, especially in retail and restoration trade, small trade in general”.
Thus, "it will be prudent to avoid great shocks in the current conjuncture." "Everything will be done to regularize these units under the law in force, without provoking their immediate closure," he added.
Lou Shenghua hopes to “have room for negotiation about the distribution of revenues between the satellite casinos and the dealers”.
Despite the concerns that reside in the unemployment of these people, Sam Hou Fai advanced in March to TDM that these fears can be removed. "I know that satellite casinos workers are distributed to the game companies, so operators have the responsibility of absorbing them or having plans for these workers," he said.
Laws for I want you
Given the history of Sam Hou Fai in court, as it has presided over the court of last instance since the establishment of the MSAR, some new measures can be expected in the area of ​​law.
Sales Marques deposits expectations in the creation of new regulations “that are more facilitators to the operation of the economy”, quite “more favorable to the competitive business environment of this Great Bay region, namely regarding the hiring of qualified human resources, conditions offered to their stay and that of their less bureaucratic families and administrative regulations”.
Lou Shenghua believes it could, in fact, “pay more attention to legal reform,” although it should be in accordance with government policies and follow the pace of times and should not be renovated just because yes, ”he said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 02:19:47</pubDate></item><item><title>LAG 2025 | Governo quer criar plataforma integrada de formação profissional</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/emprego-governo-quer-criar-plataforma-integrada-de-formacao/</link><description>In the debate on the government lines for this year, the Chief Executive highlighted the initiative to create an “integrated vocational training platform” for young people who have difficulty finding their first job. Of the 7,100 unemployed, about 4,000 are young people, said the ruler
 
There is structural unemployment in Macao and this is “notorious”. Representative NGAN Iek Hang raised the issue in yesterday's debate about the Government Action Lines (LAG) report and demanded concrete measures to the government. "Many young people have difficulty finding work in their area of ​​specialization, and many residents have tightened their belt and have been more prudent in spending. How will I improve employment support with a multidimensional approach, ensuring the use of residents?"
Sam Hou Fai, in his narrow as chief executive to present the lag and discuss them with the deputies, announced the creation of an “integrated vocational training platform” that includes government secretariats, local associations and companies to make specific courses depending on the needs of the business environment.
“Currently, the unemployment rate is 2.4 percent, about 7,100 unemployed, and four thousand are young. It is a structural unemployment and it is a situation that has emerged in the last two years. There are many specific courses finalists, such as medicine, which cannot find employment. We want to have the companies for a combination and an integrated platform for vocational training and continuous development, to see if it is possible to resolve this structural unemployment For areas, ”he said.
Sam Hou Fai also added that the proposal came from the secretary for the economy and finance, Tai Kin IP. "We also have to rely on the secretary's protection O LAM [Social Affairs and Culture], because it also has to do with education. Regarding the accreditation and professional certification, it is necessary to count on government participation, associations and companies, and the next stage is to create this integrated platform taking into account the experiences of neighboring territories," he said.
Attention to satellite casinos
Sam Hou Fai also recalled the unemployment resulting from the possible closure of satellite casinos as an example of the need for specific courses depending on the needs of the local economy. "Regarding the satellite casinos, we will have to see in two or three months to know the needs of the unemployed and then we can organize specific actions for certain areas," he explained.
The objective of the future integrated training platform is to “solve the problem of human resources”, given that hiring non-resident workers “is just a supplementary support measure that will be changed taking into account the transformation of Macao and its concrete situation”.
The Chief Executive recalled the training actions that already exist between the Macao Workers' Federation of the Federation of Associations and the Directorate of Services for Labor Affairs, as well as the game operators. "We have to take into account the 1+4 diversification strategy and create courses that give diplomas. We have to rely on companies to combine efforts," he concluded.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Book | Mark O'Neill tells the history of Europeans in the early days of Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/01/livro-mark-oneill-conta-a-historia-dos-europeus-nos-primordios-de-hong-kong/</link><description>“Europeans in Hong Kong” is the 18th and new book by British writer and journalist Mark O'Neill, who lives in the neighboring region. At HM, he confesses that he began to write the history of the Irish, but the project eventually expanded. As such, it focused on the stories of Europeans who left their brand in Hong Kong, including Portuguese
 
Hong Kong, the city of banking, finance and commerce, a worldwide warehouse for centuries and a gateway to China. It has been the neighboring region throughout the time, since its institution, in 1841. Hong Kong has always been an international territory populated by Europeans of various nationalities, much more than the British who administered the territory until 1997.
It was missing to tell its story, and British author and journalist Mark O'Neill, residing in Hong Kong since the late 1970s, now has it now with “European Europeans in Hong Kong], which even includes a chapter about the Portuguese.
In another work that has just left the newsstands, the author confesses to HM who began to write the history of the Irish in Hong Kong, whose contribution to the "was huge" territory. This work was not published, being born later the idea of ​​doing something bigger.
“I chose the figures that made the greatest contributions, especially at the religious level, or teachers, writers, great figures in the business world and those whose legacies still last,” he confessed.
Mark O'Neill points out that the great contribution of Europeans in the neighboring region took place in the educational area, but not only. "The most lasting contribution was given by schools, universities, hospitals, homes of elderly, social assistance institutions and some companies. Although they are entities that are currently managed, largely, by people from Hong Kong, were founded and fueled by Europeans."
The author explains that the most impressive story associated with the legacy of the French arises on the cover of the book. "In the nineteenth century, the French nuns adopted tens of thousands of Chinese girls who had been abandoned and gave them a good life. Without them, girls would have died or worked as child labor, maids or prostitutes," he said.
Another house
Asked about the new perceptions that the book can bring to the general public, Mark O'Neill understands that he is today "familiar with the history of British in Hong Kong, but not with the history of continental Europe."
Thus, the author says he hopes that "the book will help them understand their history, especially their contribution."
In general terms, "in the early decades [of the Hong Kong Foundation], Europeans were, above all, business men and missionaries, both Catholic and Protestants." Then the region grew “as a great Asian city and, from the 1950s, the community expanded.” "Currently, we have architects, engineers, musicians, teachers, restaurant owners, doctors, lawyers, art and people experts in all the domains of life," said the author.
Another prominent figure in “Europeans in Hong Kong” is the Jesuit Hungarian Father Laszlo Ladany, considered the “China's greatest observer in the world for thirty years”, and Anders Nelson, “Swedish singer and long-standing resident in Hong Kong, well known to local inhabitants”, describes the introduction of the work.
“Most people think that Hong Kong was built by the Chinese during their 150 years of British dominance, which is not entirely accurate. As the reader will discover, many of the schools, social assistance institutions, buildings and companies in the city were founded and managed by people from Europe (defined here as 'east of calais'). They forced it, ”is described in the same introduction.
Mark O'Neill also describes that the Hong Kong cemeteries contain traces of this presence, as "Europeans have enjoyed the city and their people more than their homeland." The European presence increased in the neighboring region from 1949, when the People's Republic of China is founded, as "the new Chinese government closed the doors to foreigners, with the exception of a small number of people from other socialist countries." Thus, "eager to remain in China and in the Chinese world, many Europeans have moved from mainland China to Hong Kong," he is mentioned.
The Macaense Legacy
The fourth chapter is entirely dedicated to the Portuguese and Macaense Hong Kong community, regarded as a “pillar of society” for many years. “For 150 years, the Portuguese were, after the British, the largest non-Chinese community in Hong Kong,” reads the work, which draws the profile of five personalities and describes two social clubs where the community was.
Regarding the personalities, the example of José Pedro Braga, the first Portuguese to be part of the Legislative Council, between 1927 and 1937; Sir Roger Lobo, member of the Executive Council between 1967 and 1985; and Commander Arnaldo de Oliveira Sales, first president of the urban council between 1973 and 1981.
“Os portugueses desempenharam um papel fundamental no Governo, nos bancos, nas profissões liberais e nas empresas comerciais. Viveram aqui durante muitas gerações. A maior parte dos expatriados ficava apenas o tempo da sua missão; quando se reformavam, partiam e regressavam à Grã-Bretanha ou a outro país da Europa. Os portugueses, por outro lado, tinham as suas próprias escolas, igrejas, clubes sociais e desportivos e a sua própria língua”, refere-se no book.
Regarding the origin of this community, it is described as a “mixed race”, or macanese, but also Portuguese with Asian origins. “Its history dates back to hundreds of years, in the early days of Portuguese trade and exploitation. In the 16th century, Portugal established commercial warehouses and religious missions in Goa, Malaca, Macau and Nagasaki. The Portuguese settlers married local women, creating a mixed root population in India, Malaysia, China and Japan. In 1639, the Japanese government expelled all foreigners and foreigners and isolated the country from the rest of the world. ”
Macao emerges closely linked to this community, as it became, in the mid-16th century, “the basis of Portugal in East Asia” after the Dutch blocked Goa and won Malacca.
"The Macanese began to form as a cohesive community-sharing ties with Portugal, the Catholic religion, a common language and kitchen and a feeling of distinction from the Portuguese colonials and their Chinese neighbors. They were the only people in Macao who spoke Portuguese and Cantonese, giving them a role of intermediaries essential for the proper functioning of government and business," he is explained.
The fact that “the Hong Kong foundation has devastated the economy of Macao” made many macanese began to move from weapons and luggage to a much more brightly saving zone. After all, "just 66 kilometers away [Hong Kong] was the best deep water port in southern China within laws, administration and military protection in the largest empire in the world."</description><pubDate>2025-04-01 23:22:33</pubDate></item><item><title>EPM | Paulo Rangel guarantees increased financial support after 11 years of cuts</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/31/epm-paulo-rangel-garante-aumento-de-apoio-financeiro-apos-11-anos-de-cortes/</link><description>On a lightning visit to Macao, Portugal's Foreign Minister argued that the position that the country maintains in the European Union does not affect the relationship with China. During Paulo Rangel's visit, it was also announced that Sam Hou Fai should visit Portugal during the summer
 
He met with Sam Hou Fai, with counselors from the Portuguese communities, associative representatives, Portuguese educational institutions and entrepreneurs. Thus was the visit of Paulo Rangel, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, in the short visit to the MSAR, which took place on Friday. There are no passages in the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) and the Consulate General of Portugal in the territory. In the late afternoon, Paulo Rangel also moved to Hong Kong to visit the exhibition “Lusas Stories”, dedicated to the Portuguese community of the territory, patent at the Hong Kong History Museum. In China, Paulo Rangel was present at the Boao Forum in Haião.
In an interview with TDM, the minister assured that Portugal's relations with China remain good, denying that the country's position in the European Union's position (EU) can represent some kind of obstacle.
"Anyone who thinks that Portugal's presence in the EU is harmful to Portugal's relationship with China, does not realize Portugal's relationship with China and does not realize the role of Portugal in the international picture. I realize that some people do not understand, but honestly we have to see it as more value. And this is seen like this," he said.
One of the voices that criticized Portugal's position in relation to stories such as the issue of Huawei and Rede 5G was Amelia António, lawyer and president of the House of Portugal in Macau.
“My expectation is not high. I would like the Minister, after visiting China, to say something friendly, as relationships have been very loose. I would like to see this relationship resumed as usual and also that we were not as followers of the EU positions, so fiercely, because we have very special interests and we have a very large Portuguese community. It should not be lost sight of, ”he told Paulo Rangel to Macao.
A questão EPM
In the interview given to TDM, Paulo Rangel also commented on the issue of EPM, stressing the points that were not on the agenda, namely the works of expansion of the facilities.
"This question has not yet been addressed. There are, in fact, several questions that have to be detailed and resolved, and one or the other that have not yet been put on the table. We know that there is search for it, but and I am being totally transparent, it is a question that is not yet on the table."
According to Lusa, Paulo Rangel also announced that the government increased financial support to the EPM, returning to the legally expected level after 11 years of cuts.
"We just replaced the Portuguese contribution to the Portuguese School of Macao, which (…) had suffered a huge cut," Rangel said on Friday.
The Portuguese State holds the majority (51 percent) of the capital of the EPM foundation, but since 2014 that Lisbon only contributed with 10 percent of school expenses, a decision taken under the Portuguese financial rescue program. EPM financing “is now at legal levels again and is the first time at the end of 11 years,” he said.
Shortly thereafter, the chief of Portuguese diplomacy told reporters that "there was no reason, honestly, to have this cut and he remained." "We have increased five times this value [of EPM financing], so this is something that is highly significant from the commitment we have."
"There are governments that really give importance to Macau and China and there are others who do not give, this is something that has to be said," lamented the minister, pointing his finger at the previous executive of the Socialist Party. The replacement of financing “is undoubtedly an important help” for EPM, which Rangel described as having a key role for Portugal in Macau.
"We also have pleased ... that there have never been so many Portuguese students - and now I speak of students from the Chinese community - as there are today in multiple schools," added the leader. "It means that also the special administrative region [of Macau] has encouraged Portuguese teaching and knowledge of Portuguese, and this is something that can only bring good relations between the two sides," added Rangel.
SAM in Portugal
From the meeting with Sam Hou Fai, which also took place on Friday, came some ideas and opinions on “Bilateral Exchange and Cooperation in the Judicial, Economic-Commercial, Education, among others,” says an official note from the Social Communication Office.
Sam Hou Fai led to the meeting topics such as “the most current development of the deepened cooperation zone between Guangdong and Macau in Henqing”, and remembered that “Paulo Rangel is the first foreign ministerial guardian he receives after the executive's head of the executive, a fact that reflects the good relations between Macao and Portugal with a longtime history”.
The chief executive also pointed out that after December 20, 1999, Macau, "with strong support from the central government, has insisted on maintaining the principle of" a country, two systems ", preserving the continental legal system, the traditional culture and customs, as well as actively maintaining the connection and foster relations with Portugal."
The ruler also said that "Macao has deepened the role of bridge and platform between China and Lusophone countries, continuously boosting the establishment of friendly relationships in the various areas of bilateral cooperation."
Another novelty of this meeting was the information, advanced by Sam Hou Fai himself, which “expects to visit Portugal in the near future” without, however, a concrete date has been announced.
Rangel announced that the chief executive of Macao is expected to visit Portugal "immediately before August or in September." "There is clearly here also an alignment of the priorities that is highly symbolic," said the diplomat, on the fringes of a meeting with the Portuguese community in Macau.
Asked about the restrictions to Portuguese in accessing the resident status, Rangel said he spoke with Sam Hou Fai "on all the issues that are relevant to the relationship between Portugal and the MSAR." "But, as it is a dialogue that is underway, I have a duty to give the opportunity we can, with the questions that have been raised from one part and the other, now we have space and time to build solutions," he added.
Rangel said that the "follow -up of dialogue" with Sam Hou Fai will take place at a meeting of the Portugal -Raem Joint Commission, "which will be organized in principle in the second semester here in Macao."
Paulo Rangel also said, in an interview with TDM, that the visit of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, president of the Portuguese Republic, “will happen a little later”, precisely due to the marking of new elections in the country. Initially, the aim was that Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa came to Macao in June to commemorate Portugal, Camões and Portuguese communities. The visit should take place in the following months of summer, predicted Paulo Rangel.
Encounters and mismatches
Paulo Rangel also had a meeting with local associative representatives, including with the Portuguese communities counselor. Francisco Mannhão, president of the Macao Retirees, Reformed and Pensioners Association (Apomac), took the opportunity to talk about the bureaucracy that still exists in the relationship with the Caixa Geral de Retirement (CGA).
"To dispatch a survival pension process takes six months and then the correspondence goes back and forth. Macao benches do not have Iban, and this, for example, delays the whole process. Whenever a process goes to CGA, they insist that they do not have the number of IBAN and NIF [Fiscal Identification Number], that most of the widows receiving survival pensions, do not have in Portugal." exemplified.
Mannão also compliments to the Portuguese politician. "For a short time he was here, he showed concern. I liked the presence of the minister." In addition, Francisco Mannão stressed that “in a good time the Portuguese government appointed Alexandre Leitão to Consul”, also recalling the good work of the previous Portuguese consul, Vítor Sereno. "The consulate has never been as well functioned as now. The criticism made to our consul are unfair. There were our associates who told me to have been admired for making a marking and was attended the next day," he said.
More bet on the language
Another important point of Rangel's visit was the promise of the reinforcement of Mandarin teaching in Portugal. "With the Chinese authorities I made a point of saying that we will be very committed to teaching Chinese in Portugal."
In the Chinese capital, Rangel met with Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, before meeting with Chinese vice-minister, Ding Xuexiang, on Hailão Island, where the Boao Forum took place.
"The situation today is much better than it was 20 years ago ... We have, in fact, a formation that we did not have at all," said Paulo Rangel. The formation of fluent people in Mandarin “is also decisive for our future”, but “it is not enough for the challenges we have ahead,” he warned.

The president of the House of Portugal in Macau associates this article with the position of Lisbon in the issue of 5G
 
It is another visit from a Portuguese ruler to Macau, but Paulo Rangel's first as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Executive of Luís Montenegro, at a time when the country is preparing to go to votes in May after the dissolution of the Assembly of the Republic.
After a journey through China, Paulo Rangel will meet with local associative leaders in order to perceive existing problems related to the Portuguese community.
At HM, Amelia António, president of the House of Portugal in Macau (CPM), argues that the difficulties of obtaining residence by Portuguese should be one of the pressing matters. “My expectation is not high. I would like the Minister, after visiting China, to say something friendly, as relationships have been very loose. I would like to see this relationship resumed as usual and also that we were not as followers of the positions of the European Union (EU) so fierce, because we have very special interests and we have a very large Portuguese community. of the EU, and this should not be lost sight of. ”
Amelia António highlights the position that Portugal adopted in the case of Rede 5G and Huawei, but also “the development that occurred in relation to the coming of Portuguese to Macau, subject to Blue Card”. “I have the feeling that everything comes following this EU policy against China. Portugal must have a position to safeguard these interests.”
Speaking to Lusa, the official made similar complaints. "We are here, we suffer the consequences of these relationships [between Portugal and China], good or bad. We had very close relations for a long time, which changed with Covid. I have not seen things again as they were, and I think it was important that Mr. Minister explains what is the position," he said that Portugal does not have to "align faithfully with everything in Europe and, above all,"
Before the pandemic, he recalled the official, there was “permanent communication” and “much exchange” between the Portuguese and Chinese authorities.
Today is noticeable a “hardening regarding the Portuguese” in macao immigration, Maria Amelia António declared, but not being able to affirm categorically whether the position is related to “this removal” between China and the West.
As autoridades de Macau não aceitam desde o ano passado novos pedidos de residência no território para portugueses, para o “exercício de funções técnicas especializadas”, permitindo apenas justificações de reunião familiar ou anterior ligação ao território.
Also Miguel de Senna Fernandes, lawyer and president of the Macanese Association, regrets the situation of the assignment of the BIR. "I would like the government of the Portuguese Republic to take into account the Portuguese community in the territory, which faces some difficulties regarding the possibility of obtaining the residence. It is a topic that may be addressed between the Portuguese State and the MSAR, to be greater flexibility to allow the Portuguese community to have greater accessibility to the right of residence, as existed before."
For the causal, "Misrere does not have to randomly assign more homes, but it is something that corresponds only to my desire." "Of course, that Mand has its reasons and Macau is different, and there are other communities that are interested in staying in the territory. The Portuguese community, due to greater historical connection that has to the territory, is still another community, among others. As Portuguese we are, we would like to have greater flexibility," he admitted.
The EPM case
Another point that Amelia António and Miguel de Senna Fernandes want to see approached on Paulo Rangel's visit is the situation at the Portuguese School of Macau (EPM) and the lack of teachers. "I think you should see the school and make a little more awareness of the situation, although the EPM is not from its area. As a member of the government it is important to realize that this situation has been poorly conducted, because in Portugal has been gone after some conversations that have little to do with reality and only harm. If he realized a little more of the situation, it would not be bad," said Amelia António.
Already Miguel de Senna Fernandes says that it is time for the Portuguese executive to stop looking at the school as another Portuguese educational institution abroad. “EPM is always a recurring question, and it all depends on how the Portuguese state looks at school: if you look like any Portuguese school spread around the world, this is a mistake. There is no possible comparison, because the EPM emerged in a very special context.”
However, to Lusa agency, Jorge Neto Valente, president of the EPM foundation, was categorical: the school “has nothing to peddling” to Paulo Rangel. "There is no whimper, we have nothing to do, we have nothing to demand, everything is normal," he said.
The lawyer and president of the founding of the EPM said Rangel hoped "take a correct perception of the school, what it is for, the goals he has." “It's always good to have direct knowledge, it's much better than in papers,” said Neto Valente. "We have to account that the school is fulfilling the role that is expected to play," added the leader, recalling that the Portuguese State holds the majority of the capital of the EPM foundation.
Still on the EPM universe, Miguel de Senna Fernandes, who also leads the Macanese Instruction Promoting Association (Apim), suggested a close look at the Chinese teaching in the EPM.
"I have always advocated that Cantonese must have status. Because students, when they leave school, are in a singing world. This with all the merit that can have teaching in Mandarin," he said. "It is an issue that should be posed. It is a delicate question, because we are talking about an official language," he added, referring to Mandarin, an official language in China.
The official, also vice president of the EPM foundation, admits that this is not a question that generates consensus -"many parents do not agree with this view" -but stresses that the learning of Cantonese "is a vehicle of integration", as it is the dominant language in the territory.
Yes to the electronic vote
Also to Lusa several associative leaders defended the transition to electronic vote, stressing embarrassment in the current options for emigration. "As long as it is not advanced without being tested, I am fully in agreement. The future is this and we have to point out," said the president of the CPM.
In legislative elections, the Portuguese abroad have the possibility of exercising the right to vote in person or by post, while in presidential and European, the vote is in person.
In the choice of correspondence, the government sends the address indicated in the census notebook the voting report and two envelopes, one green and one white, which must be returned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs after filling.
The electronic option “can offer greater security”, defended Maria Amelia António. "With the consulates to work badly, in order to have few employees, with their work, and in countries where they are far from the places where people live, it is very difficult for people to vote personally. There has also been a lot of failures in the guarantees of receiving vote [via mail]," he added.
The electronic choice is a longstanding claim of the Portuguese Communities Council (CCP). Rui Marcelo, president of the Regional Council of the Portuguese Communities of Asia and Oceania, who has a meeting scheduled with the Portuguese Foreign Minister, said that the “theme is already part of the CCP agenda“ a few years ago and has been approached several times and with several governments ”.
"With the advancement of technology and the possibility of implementing security systems that can ensure vote safety - which happens today through the provision of services in other areas of the government also - the conditions are created so that we can eventually evolve into a situation where it can obviously be a complement, but not a substitute," he noticed.
In February, the Portuguese Parliament approved a resolution proposed by the PSD to test the electronic vote in emigration. The President of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, suggested in December a pilot electronic voting experience in the circles of emigration.
The head of Portuguese diplomacy arrives in Macau today after passing by Beijing and Haikou, in the province of Haião, where he was present at the Boao Forum.
In Macao, Paulo Rangel has scheduled meetings with the head of local government, Sam Hou Fai, as well as the counselors of the Portuguese communities, associative representatives, educational institutions and entrepreneurs. Visita ainda a EPM e o Consulado-geral de Portugal no território.
In the late afternoon, MNE goes to Hong Kong to visit “Lusas Stories”, an exhibition dedicated to the Portuguese community at the Hong Kong History Museum.

At the end of March, Pataca's effective exchange rate, weighted by its trade quotas, was 105.2, representing a decrease of 1.55 points compared to the data recorded in the previous month and a growth of 1.08 relative points compared to March 2024, implying PATACA fell monthly compared to the mains of Macau's main business partners, but rose annually.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:18:37</pubDate></item><item><title>Au Kam San accuses al with obstructing access by journalists</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/au-kam-san-acusa-al-de-obstruir-acesso-de-jornalistas/</link><description>Former Deputy Au Kam San considers that the Legislative Assembly (AL) is “obstructing journalists' access to the coverage of plenary meetings. The position was taken through a Facebook post in reaction to a video published by the newspaper All Abou Macau.
In the images you can see a newspaper reporter, at first, to be prevented from circulating on the outside of the plenary room. Later, the same reporter tries to question Al and the Executive's employees about the fact that he cannot enter a room where a session opened to the public.
Since Sam Hou Fai won the elections, the All Abou Macau newspaper has been prevented from participating in press conferences, usually justifying that the places are all busy, when they are not.
This type of obstruction has now been extended to the Plenary of the Legislative Assembly, where meetings are open to the entire population. However, the journalists of the publication, although they were not the last to arrive, were taken to a separate room, where they were allowed only to watch the session through the television broadcast. The same treatment was applied to at least one member of the public.
Intentional obstruction
This aspect was criticized by Au Kam San: "When the Legislative Assembly prevents journalists from entering the Plenary Room […] is actually to deliberately obstruct interviews with the media," he said.
"Watching video sessions has many limitations, the camera can only be directed to the speaker at most, but what reporters have to do is not only to capture the speaker's expression in front of the House, but also expressions of other non-speakers, such as relevant employees or other deputies, who can become extremely important news materials," he added.
The former deputy also considered that this practice is new in the hemiciclo, which has never been seen since the time of Portuguese administration, and that the explanation that journalists do not need access to the main room is "insulting".</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:17:35</pubDate></item><item><title>Electronic Cigarettes | LAM LON WAI WANTS TOTAL PROHIBITION</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/cigarros-electronicos-lam-lon-wai-quer-proibicao-total/</link><description>The deputy of the workers asked the government to have a deadline for the ban on electronic cigarettes, and argues that smoking is prohibited at the door of restaurants and residential buildings, busy streets and outdoor areas near schools and kindergartens.
 
Lam Lon Wai wants to know when the government will prepare a bill to fully prohibit the use of electronic cigarettes. The issue is part of the latest written interpellation of the deputy linked to the Federation of Macao Workers Associations (Faom).
In the interpetement, the deputy indicates that "the latest inquiries" show that "Macao young people are increasingly using electronic cigarettes." In the optics of Lam Lon Wai, this type of cigarettes is dangerous because "it has been used for drug use in neighboring regions." Therefore, the deputy asks if the authorities will "do what they said before and propose new changes to the smoking control law."
Lam Lon Wai also asks the government to refer to what situation are the work to prohibit electronic cigarettes and to present a calendar for the approval of the measure and its entry into force.
Since 2022 a ban on entry or exit of the territory of electronic cigarettes is in force. Infringers risk paying a fine that can reach 4,000 patacas. However, if electronic cigarettes are in Macau can be used. And this is an aspect that Lam Lon Wai wants to see punished.
More Tobacco Free Areas
In order to control tobacco consumption, Lam Lon Wai also intends that the government advances with the creation of more cigarette -free areas near schools, hospitals and other public facilities.
"Residents are not satisfied with tobacco policies and say it is difficult to avoid passive smoke. They also expect authorities to continue to pay more attention, widening the zones of smoking and reinforcing advertising and law enforcement," wrote the legislator.
According to the deputy's proposal, health authorities should consider applying smoking prohibitions in places such as residential buildings, restaurants and busiest streets and even private cars, when they are children, as it says it is increasingly frequent in Hong Kong.
In addition to prohibitions, Lam suggests greater effort to help people smoke, with the creation of clinics and increasing inspection and punishment. "Especially with regard to the healthy growth of young people, it takes more preventive education about tobacco and alcohol […] and increasing young people's awareness of self -protection and we will establish a solid foundation for the project of a healthy macao," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:14:27</pubDate></item><item><title>Cultural Institute | Choi Kin Long appointed vice president</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/instituto-cultural-choi-kin-long-nomeado-vice-presidente/</link><description>Choi Kin Long was appointed, in a service committee, as vice president of the Cultural Institute (IC) for a period of one year.

Therefore, it promises to continue to study the subject, without committing to any decision
 
The government considers that doing a law that allows people to abdicate in advance of receiving medical treatments before they have lost their ability to communicate will "face various problems." This is how the Institute of Social Action (IAS), through President Hon Wai, responded to an interpellation of Ho Ion Sang on the subject. However, the president of IAS considers that the work done so far to elaborate the new legislation were "positive".
The early directive, also known as an early decision or vital will, is a choice that can be taken by citizens to refuse some specific types of treatment in the future. A practical example of your application may be when a person is in brain death, but with vital functions only artificially ensured. The early directive may establish a person's will not be linked to the machines.
The choice is allowed in regions and countries such as Portugal, Spain, Germany, South Korea, Israel, Singapore, the United States, Canada, among others.
The question arises after Hong Kong legislated on the subject, and the Macao authorities put the possibility of advancing in this regard in 2021, including the creation of a study group.
However, in view of HO issues, the government considers that there are still no conditions [to submit the proposal of law], although preliminary legislative comparison work was “positive”.
What is that?
In the understanding of the authorities it is necessary to explain to the population the reach of the early directive, which is often unknown: “Given that the legislation on the creation of the 'early direction of will' will face several problems, namely, in terms of social concept and at the level of execution, health services plan to reinforce education and dissemination, in order to raise citizens' knowledge of 'early direction of will',” was communicated. “Alongside this, they plan to carry out, in collaboration with academic institutions, a study on the 'early directive of will', promoting, in an orderly manner, the respective works,” he was added.
It should be noted that the theme was addressed in the study “Advance Directives in Macao: Not Legally Recognissed, But.” [DAV in Macao: No legal recognition, but… ”, signed by Man Teng Iong, professor at the University of Macao Law School (one), and Vera Lúcia Raposo, former director of the same faculty and currently a teacher at the Faculty of Law of the New University of Lisbon.
In the same vein, the government guarantees that it will work with local associations so that the issue is discussed with the aim of achieving consensus.
In the document, authorities also argue that in recent years have reinforced efforts to ensure that palliative care at MSAR have increasingly responding to needs and better quality.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:10:29</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing, Hong Kong and Macau accuse the US of attacking China's survival</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/pequim-hong-kong-e-macau-acusam-eua-de-atacar-sobrevivencia-da-china/</link><description>The Chinese Communist Party's main official for Hong Kong and Macao affairs and governments of both regions yesterday accused the United States of imposing tariffs to sabotage China. "The US has targeted our tariffs, they target our own survival," said Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau affairs, under the tutelage of the State Council.
"Although Hong Kong is the largest source of US commercial surplus, the United States still imposed high tariffs. This is extremely arrogant and blatant," said Xia. "The US cannot tolerate Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and are the biggest sinister manipulator that undermines human rights, freedom, the rule of law, prosperity and stability in Hong Kong," the leader added.
Xia spoke in a pre-recorded speech, transmitted during the inauguration of an exhibition in Hong Kong, regarding the National Security Education Day. “Whoever tries to lead us back to poverty and weakness is our enemy,” warned the leader. "Those who betray national interests and cheer for the enemy at critical times will never be tolerated," he added.
Chief Words
Today, at the same ceremony, Hong Kong's government leader John Lee Ka-Chiu accused the United States of, in a "wicked logic," imposing tariffs to protect his "unhealthy hegemony." "The United States oppose free trade, interrupt global trade and supply chains (…), severely damaging the multilateral trade system and the process of globalization," said John Lee.
The chief executive has assured that Hong Kong "will keep his status from Porto Franco with basically null fees" and will file a complaint against the United States to the World Trade Organization.
Also the leader of the Macao government yesterday criticized the United States for the "abusive imposition of customs taxes on all its business partners," including China, "under several pretexts." Also during the inauguration of an exhibition due to National Security Education Day, Sam Hou Fai said Washington "severely devastated the multilateral trade system (...) and damaged the stability of the world economic order."</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Sam Hou fai fear deficit but will review budget to reinforce support</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/sam-hou-fai-teme-defice-mas-vai-rever-orcamento-para-reforcar-apoios/</link><description>The new Macao government leader admitted yesterday to fear a deficit in 2025, due to the slowdown in the game's revenues, but reiterated that he will review the region's budget to reinforce social support.
"I am worried, if game revenues only reach 15 billion [of Patacas per month], it may result in a budget deficit," Sam Hou Fai told the deputies.
It is recalled that Ho Iat Seng had predicted game revenues of 240 billion patacas by 2025, or 20 billion per month. But in the first three months of the year, Macao casinos registered total revenues of 57.7 billion patacas, below the Government target, despite an increase of 0.6 percent compared to the same period of 2024.
“We have to have a feeling of risk,” warned Sam Hou Fai, during the debate on the Government Action Lines (LAG) to 2025, in the Legislative Assembly. Basic law requires public accounts to remain on positive land.
The government leader recalled that China - by far the main source of tourists to Macau - fell into deflation (annual fall of consumer prices) in March for the second consecutive month, "but savings increased." Sam Hou Fai argued that these data show that the Chinese population also has "a feeling of risk", which was already before the new US president, Donald Trump, start a trade war with China.

Tamanho é relativo
On Monday, at the press conference after the LAG presentation, the chief executive admitted that Trump's tariffs will have a "more indirect" impact on Macao. Sam Hou Fai pointed out as probable consequences the decrease, both of the consumption of local families and a break in the number of visitors and consumption, especially in case of devaluation of the Renmimbi.
Still, the government leader guaranteed yesterday that he will review the budget to 2025, prepared by the predecessor, for measures such as the creation of a fund, worth 10 billion patacas, to support small and medium enterprises.
Sam Hou Fai admitted that current expenses, social support and public function, “will only increase, not decrease” but preferred to focus on the diversification of public revenues.
In the first two months of 2025, taxes on the game represented 89.3 percent of Macao government current revenues.</description><pubDate>2025-04-16 01:37:11</pubDate></item><item><title>The Great America (i)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/a-grande-america-i/</link><description>“There is a providence that protects idiots, drunkards, children and the united states of America.”
Otto von Bismarck
 
America in “First” has to do with the pride of pride of a people known to be a headlight of humanity, today inclined to self-pity or revenge. Fragmented in dozens of mental and social affiliations entrenched in repellent perimeters. Each with its own power.
Strangers to each other. Trump's exceptionalism is territorial. America as home. Space preserved by God for the benefit of the white Christian patriot. The idea is not enough for what's left of it. Target of the “large America” owner of the American semicontinent. Protected by rights and tariffs. Impenetrable fortress.
Hence the garrison of referee immensity, threatened by the Chinese penetration that advances covered by Russia along the northern route, the short route between the Far East and America, soon emancipated from the impeding ice.
Washington wants to widen his sovereignty to Canada to be bought, and Granelândia to be taken by force if Denmark resists. Finally, a defense border for the Imperial United States, between the arctic and Rio Grande/Bravo.
In addition, the Panama exclas the short distance between the two oceans to protect against intruders. Core with enough resources to master rivals, as long as it does not succumb to the temptation to eliminate them or, worse, to convert them. American Pax that Trump, monomaniac of agreements, intends to establish one after another. Weapon on the table.
Nothing new under the sun. Much of the federal territory was acquired through agreements with the assignor state, sometimes rewarded with cash gratifications, often persuaded by force or threat.
Real estate transactions. Louisiana's assignment from Napoleon to the United States stands out from all others. More than two million square kilometers, including the strategic Mississippi Basin, which would have made France world superpower.
Purchased for fifteen million dollars in 1803, the equivalent of four hundred and twenty million currently. Not even one tenth of the average value of an NBA club (4.6 billion). The lack of territorial continuity in “Great America” according to Trump. Between Darién's disheveled jungle, the barrier between Panama and Colombia, where the Pan American road asphalt that connects Alaska to Argentina gives way over one hundred and five kilometers to impassable rails from Migrants on the way to El Dorado and Rio Grande/Bravo are the states of Central America and the Mexican giant.
In the logic of the fortress, it would seem natural to dry this infected swamp to describe it in Trumpian jargon. At least, take Mexico. But no. The reason is that the hundred and thirty million Mexicans violate the American racial canon.
Catholic creed and tone Hispanics, mixed with the remnants Amerindians, added to the forty million companions previously entrenched in the United States, would form an unassimilable block by the "wasps" in decline. The borders of “Great America” are first established by race, then by strategic imperatives. Without sufficient homogeneous demography there is no nation and without a dominant nation there is no empire. The breed drew the country, decrees Daniel Immerwahr, historian of "Great America." The mega -American profile is hidden by the logo map that reduces the United States to the continent. Concealment.
America is geopolitically correct, therefore false, useful for spreading the image of a continental republic, without Alaska, Hawaii or the multitude of ocean territories that dot the empire in denial.
An empire that cannot be revealed to himself, because his citizens do not have the imperialist Tique created by the former British lord, inherited in these ancient colonies only by a political-military minority-inspired by feverish visionary minority. The "Great America" ​​is an empire disguised as a nation. It gives priority to the cohesion of its inhabitants, decided by race, in the cultural sense of the term. Confirming that Trump has a weak for Plato, is discovered in the "republic" (IV, 423b-c) the socratic precept that modulates its expansionist verve which is "increasing the state until it can, as it grows, remains one."
Hence Canada, as a country of white Anglo-Saxon sufficiently, although with spots of francophone and Catholics. Gronelândia too, because it is a little empty (some insignificant fifty -seven thousand human beings, mostly native to statute and dollar) but is rich in natural resources, military bases and installations including underground tunnels since Roosevelt treated the largest island in the world as World War II to prevent it from falling into Hitler's hands.
Mexico doesn't. Excluded for being an undesirable carrier. To be kept under control through the threat of punitive expeditions to hunt for illegal immigrants. Justified by the intention of reaching drug cartels that traffic Fentanil and other synthetic opiates whose chemical precursors come from China according to Trump for all states, so considered “terrorist organizations” by Trump.
As a corollary, Mexico is a state that covers the terrorists. Justified by the Bush doctrine, proclaimed after September 11, the American military who patrols the Rio Grande/Bravo Front are qualified to perform anti -terrorist Russians in a little sovereign Mexico. Finally, the racial subtext of expansion evokes the "Anglostra", a rap geopolitical presentation of ancient fascination that trumpland circles sing outer empire of "Great America."
A confederation between the United States with Canada, Greenland and Panama attached, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. A stunning white, almost totalitarian. A family united by language, history and familiarity. Founded on mutual trust. Already structured as an intergovernmental bureaucracy in terms of intelligence and more. A little gratifying conclusion for us Europeans.
This combat America is interested in us as tools, not as partners. Trump wants an American America, not a Western America. In a geopolitical and cultural sense. Europe is out of the radar. We are responsible for this devaluation. Europe is out of contact with history. Worse yet, you don't want to know her. Cover the eyes and ears to deceive that it exists. That it is worth it. But on the fringes of the modern world, dominated and divided for five centuries by its empires, it continues to dream of itself as the owner of humanity. Supreme paradigm. Sophisticated island of “good” in the chaotic and war archipelago of “evil”.
Homo Europaeus will never admit, like Carl Schmitt that "I am a won. Two lost world wars, two." The inertia of glory, a day conquered on the battlefield, transcends the pretense of being a universal model. Having renounced the profession of arms, our alleged greatness lies in radiating the order of peace, which we give ourselves the example. With contempt for the ridicule.
Like the Knight of Orlando Enamorado written by Matteo Boiardo and published in 1495, stating that "he did not realize the coup, but continued to fight, and was dead ... and died of laughter those who saw him." Or maybe we Europeans are living one of these near-death experiences about which neuroscientists focus. Auras of serenity described by those who leave the coma and remember life after death, light in the tunnel of unconsciousness. Miracles of a suspended time that compresses the difficulties of a life in times of ecstasy. We undoubtedly practice the successful elimination of reality.
Psychoanalyst and psycho-historian, Franco Fornari in “The Psychoanalysis of War” aware that it is the affective codes that move history, studied the sleep of Europe almost half a century to determine that dreams contained.
Discovered the nightmares. We laugh by the emotional insensitivity syndrome in the same way as a peasant that works with the hands develops in the skin, also the person who continually receives unpleasant information is induced to develop corns in the brain. It is a form of defense. Emotional callus syndrome has developed in parallel to the expansion of the means of information and mass communication. Topical diagnosis. In order not to see chaos within us and around us, we are tempted to abandon the excess of "information" that floods our psyche. With the risk of emotional alienation that protects us from the facts.
And therefore the duty of interpreting them. The story falls into prescription. And with it our responsibility. We are like Neo in the Matrix, called to choose between the blue pill and the red pill.
The sedative blue pill allows him to convince himself that the bad experiences he has lived are hallucinations to adapt to the pseudo-realization of the matrix. The red makes him return to the terrible reality. Unlike Neo (Keanu Reeves), who chooses to deal with his world of the next century as it is in the film and perhaps will be in reality, human human intelligence that turned against him, the European of the last three generations prefers the blue pill that holds him to matrix fiction.
Is blue the color of virtual Europe? The graceful European Union (EU), which, not by abbreviation, baptized “Europe”. With all values, the historical weight, the pedagogical claim that the “continent” was attributed. If Europe, instead of being a myth, were a geopolitical actor, Trump's trauma should bring us back to reality. Out of the "European project" chatter that no one knows the text, the eruption of terrible simplification should remember the motto of former American boxer Mike Tyson that "everyone has a plan until they punch in their mouths." In our case, the risk is not taking this salutary punch because for Trump no more or less we exist.
As Zelensky fears, the world could "continue without Europe." Not because it will be canceled. Because there is, nor has there been, a subject of Europe, as the reading of any historical Atlas attests (is that also why no one is already published?). Richard von Metternich's scratch as “geographical expression” would be better applied to Europe. Those who, like Napoleon and Hitler, were closer to occupying the whole space, which a curious French canon wants to extend from the Atlantic to the Urals, in fact considered the theme of their theme. Expansion of your own state.
It was necessary an empire invented in America by Europeans to escape to encompass in its hegemonic arc the almost all of the continent's geography. As for the Russian Empire, we are in the “Asian front”. Peninsular tail of the “great mother”. The EU sees Trump as the devil. Because, once the mask of liberal internationalism is removed, America reveals the little presentable face of Community Fiction. Subvertes their premises, exposes their betrayals and their macroscopic limits.
The lack of democratic legitimacy, impossible without a European people; the (unsuccessful) attempt to open the internal borders without ensuring the external; The requirement that new members of central and eastern Europe, an expression of nationalisms exasperated by the long subjugation to hostile empires, adapt to the “EU norms” that these same ethnicisms would like to liquidate. Extreme paradox, claim European “sovereignty” without a sovereign. EU subjects remain their founders; the states. Each with its own style, committed to using community resources for their own purposes. Therefore, speaking of “European defense” without a European state, belonging to the American Empire in its military version (NATO), makes no sense. We ignore that at the source of the “European project” is America, interested in structuring its avant -garde in Eurasia. And that we Europeans not only accepted it as we wanted the “Atlantic Pact”, each for its benefit. Of so many aporias, the birth of the “Bom Monster of Brussels”.
Architecture in permanent progress in the style of the “Holy Family” that, incidentally, is announced in 2026 a kind of regional UN with markedly late-soviet characteristics. In short, an almost legal construction, without foundation or political soul. Definitely unfinished. Therefore, sterile or worse yet exploitable for the interests of others. A chaos engine, anything but the order. Until yesterday, the European boat was floating. Today, under the pressure of the double geopolitical and technological revolution, the “soft power”, waves without compass.
Margaret Verstager, an former EU commissioner, confessed: "Europe is said to be a regulatory superpower. But we can regulate things we know. It is very difficult to regulate what is not known." We would add and that they do not even belong to you. For those of us who feel Europeans as nationals of the various 27 states, not vice versa, the advent of Trump is apocalytic in the original sense of the term, revealing.
An opportunity to reflect on the place we will occupy in the restructuring of the American Empire if it survives. And above all, about the role we will play in this effort. Preface, outside Europe, almost no one believes that the conquest of territories should follow rules, the contrary.
Even if it is reserved for states. The great American oligarchs have the financial firepower to buy Africa or Latin America. Give up the rhetoric of ius publicum Europaeum. Recentrate in the material constitution of international policy. Now that we find ourselves naked, to react we have to answer three questions: why we are confused in self-delusion of being Europe; how the United States see us; What does this mean to us Europeans?</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:48:59</pubDate></item><item><title>Embarrassed teachers</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/15/professores-envergonhados/</link><description>Teachers are study, knowledge, culture, dedication and suffering. There are no two equal teachers. Some female and others in the masculine. In Portugal we attend teachers, with children, to be placed 300 kilometers from home.
To reach the teaching site and not have the minimum conditions of habitability. Teachers are the fundamental of the formation of our children. Many parents do not understand that the formation of their descendants has to do with teachers and that education has to be done within the family. Teachers must have been the professional class that was the most impaired and more manifestations of protest for many years. Their protests aimed to correct the situation of thousands of teachers who were surpassed in their career by colleagues with less time of service. Since 2018, about 50,000 teachers have not been properly repositioned, resulting in the placement of teachers with the same time of service at different echelons, due exclusively to legal norms. The teachers always stressed that they did not fight for more money, but for justice. There were teachers who were over 30 years old on the 10th level when they should have been placed in the seventh level.
Last year, a gigantic demonstration with teachers from all over the country was held in Lisbon, at a meeting held by the National Federation of Teachers (FenProf) and leader Mário Nogueira argued that it was necessary to create a more attractive career that kept those still in schools and attracted young people and those who chose to abandon the profession ahead of time. Teachers through their representatives have gained some claims. However, schools remain places of great concern. Students have lost respect for teachers and there have been several cases of violence in which students assault teachers. It is not easy to be a teacher these days.
However, last week the whole class of teachers must have been very embarrassed. And it's sad to know of embarrassed teachers. Why? Because it was disclosed on social networks that a teacher had an ignoble behavior of pure racism. The teacher, from very young students, asked everyone present in class to assert what they dreamed of their adulthood. The students were answering what they thought and when it came to a student with African roots, the teacher returned: "You, it is not worth talking because the so -called your color end up in alcohol and misery ...". There was a sepulchral silence in the classroom and the African kid got up and said: “The teacher is very mistaken. You will end in misery very first that I know that I was orphaned and was adopted by a very rich family, my grandparents are very rich and my parents are very rich and I am the grandson and the only child that I will receive several fortunes…”.
This case has shocked many communities and many teachers have been embarrassed because it is inadmissible for a teacher to be racist to the point of being able to traumatize a student for the rest of his life. Racism exists, always existed. But a teacher cannot give such a negative example of the true training function in a classroom. Racism is fought for how many human and democratic rights argue. In Portugal we have an far right party with racist laivos. Possibly the teacher in question is electing this party. It is hardly believed that a teacher rejects the word of a "black" student just because he is "black" and tells him that he will end up in alcohol and misery like all "blacks". The teacher showed not having the least knowledge of the world around her or is really radical racist. We have millionaire Africans, lawyers, engineers, architects, doctors, journalists, deputies, leaders of large companies, police, all excellent and, fortunately, we have Portuguese of African origin in most professions.
This teacher cannot continue to embarrass his colleagues. The teacher has to be the subject of a disciplinary process that aims to be expelled from the profession and the parents of the offended young man should move a criminal case against the teacher through court. This was a regrettable case and the question is: how many more similar cases will happen through schools across the country? Such a discrimination, so serious, should not go unpunished and the school principals must have the complete knowledge of what kind of teachers they have in their schools so they can end with inadmissible facts as we have reported. Ai, Portugal, Portugal…
PS - In previous chronicle we wrote about the illegalities that took place in Portuguese prisons. Last week, the Judiciary Police carried out a mega operation in several arrests and two prison guards and a PSP agent were connoted with the entry of drugs and mobile phones in the prisons.</description><pubDate>2025-04-15 14:23:18</pubDate></item><item><title>Macau, the story well told</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/11/macau-a-historia-bem-contada/</link><description>On April 14, the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, will present the “Report of Government Action Lines for the Financial Year 2025”, exactly a week after Black Monday, during which Hang Seng's Index Hang Kong sank to 13.74 percent. The biggest challenge of the chief executive is to build a positive narrative about Macao in the government line report, so that citizens can have a feeling of gain, happiness and security.
Telling a story well and doing something well done are two distinct concepts of two different levels. For example, when a seller tries a customer to buy a car, he will discuss the superiority of quality and vehicle performance that, in addition, will be very appealing. However, when the buyer finally uses the car may see that what the seller said was a beautiful story. The saying “practice is the only test to the truth” remains valid.
I appreciate the honesty of the current secretary for the economy and finance, which made it clear that the revenues of the 2025 fiscal year may not come to expect expectations. After Macao was released from the Covid-19 pandemic, the full recovery of his economy is dependent on the efforts of the current RAE government.
Faced with the current situation of Macao, the RAE government cannot use the apologies of the complexity and motility of the international scenario and the existence of several unstable internal factors to dodge their responsibilities. After all, under the guiding principle “Macau governed by patriots”, the weak governance of Macau is a problem of those in power. Thus, I hope that in your first report of the governance line lines, Sam Hou Fai can really outline a way to carry out the main points proposed in its political program during the election campaign, including: “work, oriented to people's subsistence”, “distribution of revenue,“ urban development, oriented to people's subsistence ”and“ safeguard safety, crucial to people ”.
By effectively using the institutional advantages of Macao as a business opportunities platform, the MSAR government can write a new chapter in the practice of “a country, two systems” and transform Macau into a happy city.
The presentation of the “Report of the Governing Action Lines for the Financial Year 2025” is of great importance to Macau. The 15th National National Games of R.P. of China are also an important event of this year, which Macau will organize and host in conjunction with Guangdong and Hong Kong, but even more important will be the elections for the 8th Legislative Assembly of MSAR, scheduled for September 14.
As in 2025 there will be elections for the Hong Kong Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly of MSAR, it is important to be successful, particularly the choice of MSAR Legislative Assembly, elected by direct suffrage, to demonstrate the success of the realization of the concept “a country, two systems”, which “Hong Kong is governed by Hong Kong people”. and "Macao is governed by Macao people" and by the guiding principle "Hong Kong governed by Patriots" and "Macau ruled by patriots." The story about the elections for the 8th Legislative Assembly of MSAR should not only be well told, but must also be well executed to obtain the confidence of the central government.
Because you receive a concert does not mean that the public will attend, because it depends on who acts. For the election of deputies for direct suffrage to the 2025 Legislative Assembly, I provide for more than 14 lists of applications, considering the efforts currently developed by various associations and the inclusion of list of candidates for the election of deputies for direct suffrage to the 2021 Legislative Assembly that were not elected.

America, China and Russia fear for their existence. In these degrees of self -conscience, it is only considered alive who is a great power. If we are reduced to a lower level, we are tempted to commit suicide (experienced sweetness of the Soviet Union). We let ourselves go. Hence the "great war" in several warm or warm theaters that if not suspended will become "total". The disorder opens holes that invite the ambitious. Old empires already diagnosed as being irreversible (Turkey, Japan), ancient colonies that rediscover as civilized states (India/Bharat), humiliated and offended nations due to the infringement of their neighbors (eg Poland).
While the protagonists in the day before yesterday are struggling from the fake penultimate hegemony to the false couple France-Germany, confined to "Simul Stabunt Simul Cadent." The waves of chaos swallow neutral or neglected lands reduce the distances between the “three large”, elbow the elbow in the seas of China, Ukraine, soon in the arctic. The hegemonic transition flows from America to chaos. And then it will remain for a long time. A rival colossus does not dissolve overnight, especially if it is able to drag the rest of the world to the disaster. When your time comes, your last wish will be to prevent others from occupying your throne.
America is fighting with itself. Epic conflict, to which the esoteric verses of Theodor Däbler, Austrian of Trieste, which states that "the enemy is the figure of our own matter will apply/ And he will pursue us, and we to him, to the end." In the struggle for survival, America knows that its inner evil is healed towards the world, but only after restoring the natural order of things. We, Europeans ahead, the others behind or against. The new winning combination of uninhibited post liberal elites and techniques, anarchive hybrids, is convinced of this, reinforced by the vindictive enthusiasm of the middle-classes frustrated by globalization, the “invasion” of non-assimilated allergen in the WASP canon and the decline of their own lifestyle. This strange alliance found in Donald Trump his exuberant champion.
Prophet of the “common sense”. Brutal in logic and gestures. Incarnation of the “terrible simplifier”, the ideal type of demagogue violating rules evoked with horror by Swiss historian Jakob Burckhardt in the late nineteenth century. Inspired by the Republic of Plato would say that "justice is but the benefit of the strongest." Baptize itself as a "very stable genius." Chosen by God, who diverted the bullet with which the satanic "deep state" wanted to liquidate him. The story will say. However, let us notice that there is genius in its terribly simplified actions. To bring to the letter. The first act of the second Trump, subversive and man of the order, is very scenic. Frantic. America's disease requires dangerous healing. A nearly 80 -year -old president, with only four years in office ahead, starting from the principle that he will not eventually reinterpret the Constitution, inventing a third one has to worry.
He starts from where he can reap immediate rewards that is the American myth. His narrative extols the will and, therefore, the certainty of being great again. For Trump, wanting is power. Wanting is dreaming and dreaming. Reveal the “manifest fate 2.0” to its compatriots. New border required. Operational objective. Ergo, the mastery of the space to control the earth and to snatch the audience with the Martian legend told by Musk; Supremacy reinforced in AI to govern cyberspace, lead the technological revolution, reinvent the industry on unpublished, perhaps fantastic principles avoiding discovering them too early so as not to alienate the workers; Delete the Ukrainian and Middle East fires and prepare the wars of the future whose dawn we can barely glimpse.
Possibly without combating them, thanks to the restoration of the lost deterassion. The alpha and the omega of this narrative is the quick ads through social networks. Technology stars preside over the chapters of myth. It is the generals who lead the respective avant -garde on the technological fronts of strategic value. Almost autonomous powers that Trump intends to explore, control and master as they penetrate informally in the state's ruins. Announces a battle between Trumpian tribes by public and private skills and powers. Better, public-private, given the overlap of functions and responsibilities. Game without rules. Sooner or later, the confrontation between Trump and Musk, the most celebrated and powerful of the technological border oligarchs, which the president kicks or frustrated, yes, day no, seems inevitable.
A decisive confrontation, because without the technological star the Trumpian dream would become a nightmare. Trump, the revolutionary, rare but true where an individual's success or failure will affect the fate of the nation and the world. The proof of how deep and structural is the emotional collapse of Americans. The revolt of a court of filthy rich, bored by money and energized by power, destroyed the centered exhausted stablishment. The holograms of the Biden administration are enjoying an unmerited rest. While federal and blue bureaucracies are involved in a party guerrilla war with the support of the hard line. A low intensity civil war. The New York tycoon wants to cut the Gordian knot that is strangled to America which is the incompatibility between exceptionalism and universalism.
Complexio Oppositorum as he called Jung for containing the opposites within himself and enrolled by the founding parents in the genetic code of stars and stripes, which made the United States a unique specimen in the potential of the powers. Making America big again means opting for exceptionalism rather than universalism. Establish yourself unsurpassed at the top of the world as it is, and not redeem it as it should be. If they want to reaffirm themselves as number one, keeping the Chinese at a distance, they cannot consume in endless, often lost and, at best, repressed wars.
Nor turn other tyrannies into democracies, violate tribes into nations, transmute other people's misery into prosperity at the expense of their own half-lives.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:53:25</pubDate></item><item><title>SCM Hostel | Multimedia art of five artists on display</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/albergue-scm-arte-multimedia-de-cinco-artistas-em-exposicao/</link><description>“Verses of Rain in Late Spring - New Media Art Exhibition” opened doors yesterday at the SCM hostel gallery. The show exhibits Cindy ng sio ieng multimedia artwork, Kit Ka Ieng Kit, Wang Tou Kun, Chon Iap Lam and Xiaoqiao Li
 
The Holy House of Mercy (SCM) has a new exhibition on display since yesterday. It is “Verses of Rain in Late Spring-New Media Art Exhibition” [Rain Verses In late Spring-New Media Art Exhibition] and presents works by five artists: Cindy Ng Sio Ieng, Kit Kit Kit Kit Kun, Chon Iap Lam and Xiaoqiao Li.
According to a press release released by the organization, artists “use digital photography, interactive digital sound installations, computerized painting and invisible paint” to make a new interpretation of the “ecological wisdom contained in the 24 solar terms”, creating a new artistic vocabulary.
In the same note it is described that the works exposed “simulate natural light and shadow effects through virtual lighting techniques, creating the aesthetics of spring beauty”. “Real -time sound data is also used to conduct facilities through which the public can experience the rhythm of coexistence” of all exposed elements.
This “interdisciplinary creation breaks with the traditional narrative forms of art, exploring issues of technology and sustainable development,” says the organization, which also says to “provide the public with a cyclical philosophical experience” based on rain power and the idea that “rain nourishes all grains”. Thus, "contemplation of the relationship between technology and nature is encouraged while appreciating art."
Various dimensions
Patent until May 28, this show was organized by the CAC - Circle of Macao Culture Friends, with Cindy Ng Sio Ieng as curator.
Cindy Ng Sio Ieng indicates that the exhibition refers to the final period of spring, "with the arrival of the" grain rain "station, when it reveals a poetry of its own season that" flows around the world. " In this show there are “virtual light and shadow that simulate the dance of nature”, while the use of sound data by artists in real time serves “to boost the rhythm of coexistence”.
In the case of artist Wang Tou Kun, born in Macau, digital photography is the means used to express itself artistically. Graduated from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, with specialization in digital media and photography, the artist expresses his personal experiences, both at the time and in the environment, and explores “the relationship between reality and virtual through digital media processing, in a concept that describes as 'post-photography'”.
In this show at the SCM Wang Tou Kun hostel presents “The Interconnected Nature Forest Shadow”, inspired by the very environment of the Patio do Albergue SCM, a space in the middle of the São Lazaro neighborhood, with old trees.
Thus, there are images “in fluid layers of transparent fabric”, in which the trees mirror “dancing shadows” and “the cracks of the brick walls and the veins of the leaves” interconnect.
The artist also presents the series of images “9+2: Kunyu Wanguo Quantu”, focused on the 11 cities that make up the area of ​​the Great Bay. “Using website screen catches, the artist extensively collects images related to these cities,” then resorting to “digital collage techniques, skillfully fusing the screen captures to build a surreal landscape of interconnected cities,” the organization describes.
Chon Iap Lam, another participating artist, is a designer of theater lights and presents the work “Two-Dimensional Tree”, where he uses light and shadow facilities “to deconstruct the relationship between ancient trees and their shadows, as well as the two-dimensional and three-dimensional characteristics of the shadows”.
Thus, “in the dream space created by the installation of light, the audience can feel the shadows of the trees to swing, as if immersed in a transparent fabric forest, surrounded by several tree silhouettes,” describes the curator of the show. With this work, Chon Iap Lam shows "the professional experience in light design, reflecting his exploratory spirit in the field of digital art."
In turn, Xiaoqiao Li, a professor at the Hong Kong Metropolitan University Department of Creative Arts, presents digital animation work entitled “Phantom Terin: Landscapes Reimagined Through Gaussian Point Clouds”, where he employs 3D technology to create landscapes that explore the border between reality and virtual.
Already the artist Kit Lei Ka Ieng presents “Unfold”, an interactive work that “uses coding to allow plant growth patterns to change in response to musical melodies, transiting perfectly between the forms of water droplets and crystals”. The artist has been dedicated to multimedia art, focusing on digital images, sound installations and new media.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:33:02</pubDate></item><item><title>History | Book about Americans in Macao in the 19th century presented today</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/historia-livro-sobre-americanos-em-macau-no-seculo-xix-apresentado-hoje/</link><description>The book “To the Farthest Gulf for the Wealth of India - Macao Representations in the Peabody Essex Museum (Salem)”, by Rogério Miguel Puga, tells the story of Americans who lived in Macao in the nineteenth century. The Academic today presents in the Portuguese Bookstore the work that resulted from consultation with records stored in a museum in Salem, in the state of Massachusetts
 
Macao has long been a place of trade and experiences of people from around the world. One of the foreign communities that lived in the territory, in the busy nineteenth century, consisted of Americans, whose presence in Macao lasted in photographs, diaries, objects and paintings, present at the Peabody Essex Museum, in Salem, Massachusetts.
These signs of the ostentation of life, wealth and business that Americans had in the territory were the subject of analysis by Rogério Miguel Puga. The academic linked to New University of Lisbon launched, in 2023, a book that resulted from years of investigation into this theme, entitled “To the Farthest Gulf for the Wealth of India - Macao Representations at Peabody Essex Museum (Salem)”. The author presents today the work in Macau, from 18:30, in a session in the Portuguese Bookstore.
At HM, it tells a little about the long course of research and writing, which was supported by the Macau Foundation. "I started the book in Macao in 2009, but only in 2023 was released. It makes perfect sense to present the book in the city that is the subject of the investigation and where it was started."
The academic states that today's presentation in the Portuguese bookstore is “doubly symbolic” because there is a collaboration with Ciela, a research center of the University of Macau (one), where Rogério Miguel Puga has presented some lectures on the themes of the book, dynamized by professor Mário Pinharanda Nunes.
Today's session at the Portuguese Bookstore is moderate by Joshua Erlich, a professor at UM, “who also conducts research on the East India Company in India, thus communicating his work with my study on the British presence in Macau between 1635 and 1793, already published,” said Rogério Miguel Puga.
The author confesses that the event also symbolizes a return to a territory that has not visited since 2019 and where it always finds new topics to study. ” "This time, I focused on the Portuguese presence in Hong Kong, after visiting the exhibition 'Lusy Stories' at the Hong Kong Museum of History, which I will soon publish a reception in Portugal," he told HM.
The book presented today has been for sale at the Plaza Cultural Macau Bookstore, SENG KWong Bookstore (Starlight Bookstore) and the Macau Foundation's public information center.
Show Macau to the World
What objects were these and what did they serve? What useful did you have for Americans travelers in a time of rare and difficult communications? At a time when Macau was the only gateway to China, which did not allow residence to foreigners, they landed here to do business. Then, arrived in the US, showed Macao they had known.
Rogério Miguel Puga discovered this universe when he visited the museum in 2005. “I realized that in one of the museum rooms were several representations of Macau. I found the connection [from the territory] to Salem curious. It was a picture identified as Macau, but it was, in fact, a representation of Shanghai. and other artists, ”he said in an interview conducted in 2023.
At the Salem Museum there are objects such as fans, fitting tables, table tops, portraits, sewing tables with macao representations or portraits commissioned by Americans. Rogério Miguel Puga writes not only about these objects, but also about the historical context of the time, having also conducted research in cities such as New York, Philadelphia and Washington.
However, it also takes place today, between 2:45 pm and 4 pm, at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, the lecture “Anglo-Portuguese Relations and the British Presence in Macau (18th-19th centuries)”, the theme in the book. This is a session where we talk a little about the history of these western traders looking for Macao to do business with China, especially from 1700, when the Eastern Indian Company establishes direct trade relations with the country. In the lecture will also be mentioned the social and cultural interconnections that have taken place in these years between foreign traders and local populations.</description><pubDate>2025-04-16 01:27:10</pubDate></item><item><title>Rui Cunha Foundation hosts book launch on buildings life</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/fundacao-rui-cunha-acolhe-lancamento-de-livro-sobre-vida-util-dos-edificios/</link><description>The Docomomo Macau Research Center has launched an invitation to present the book “How to prolong the life of buildings”, which results from a Macao Docomomo investigation into the most significant examples of twentieth -century modern architecture.

Throughout the conversation it will also be addressed the conservation of architectural heritage, which, according to the organizers, has as its background the increasingly intense threats. "In recent decades, the architectural heritage of the last century seemed more threatened than in any other period.

Analysts also emphasize the growth in the number of great gamblers
 
The volume of bets on Macao casinos is being affected by the impact of commercial disputes between the United States and China and the arrest of some casin employees related to alleged illegal money exchanges. The scenario was outlined by the Citigroup Investment Bank, in a report cited by the GGR Asia portal.
"Despite the trade war between China and the United States-which arouses concerns about a reduction in appetite for the game-the stakes of the highest mass segment still exceed 11.1 million Hong Kong's dollars, which is surprisingly stable against the same period," read the report signed by George Choi and Timothy Chau.
The report was based on analyst checks in the casinos and they indicate that they even found that some great gaming gamblers. "The great gamblers continued to be detected actively and, on average, bet 2 percent more than the previous year," was pointed out.

From the analysts 'perspective, the fact that there are great gamblers and the volume of bets on the previous levels also removes concerns against two recent operations against illegal casinos' exchange of casinos, which resulted in the detention of some employees of concessionaires.
"The fact that these bets happen before our eyes also suggests that concerns about the recent intensification of Macao police repression of attachment stores that can act as change of money can be exaggerated - as players can still bring money to game tables," he was justified.
At the end of March, the authorities announced two operations against alleged illegal money exchange networks for the game, which led to the detention of 42 people, including dealership workers. According to the authorities, the exchanges will have moved to the casinos about 790 million and dollars of Hong Kong.
Last year, in April, the total gross revenues of the game were 18.5 billion Patacas, which represented a growth of 53.7 percent, compared to the same period, when they had been 14.7 billion patacas.</description><pubDate>2025-04-16 01:23:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Zelensky vs Zelensky</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/31/zelensky-vs-zelensky/</link><description>10/27/22
A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us the wife and daughter (cf. recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: Alto there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that the holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses?
Quantos não se abandonarão ao que é?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those who wait for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of the prize, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I do not always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club Narrative Prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as Antonio Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter my dear friend: You are a pure, excellent and noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people who always seem the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my rank of hatter at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:

Growth is in line with the rhythm of expansion achieved by the world's second largest economy in the fourth quarter and exceeds the goal of “about 5 percent” to the year 2025 established by Beijing.
The impulse comes at a time when US President Donald Trump intensified the Beijing Trade War, threatening a total dissociation between the world's two largest economies, at a time when China already faces a prolonged real estate crisis.
The data released by the National Statistics Office (GNE) exceeded the consensual estimate of 5.2 percent of economists responded by the Bloomberg news agency.
Industrial production expanded 7.7 percent in March, compared to the same period of the previous year, in faster growth since June 2021. Retail sales have increased by 5.9 percent, the best pace since December 2023.
"The most pleasant surprise is retail sales, which shows that consumption subsidies are working," said Michelle Lam, economist at French Bank Society Generale SA to China, quoted by the agency. "Industrial production was a surprise, but understandable after the strong export data. But this is now part of the past," he told Bloomberg.
Despite the positive data, the GNE recommended caution, stressing the need to give greater support to the economy.
"We must be aware that the external environment is becoming more complex and severe. The impulse of internal demand for growth is insufficient and the basis for economic recovery and sustained growth is yet to consolidate," the office said in a statement. “We have to implement more pro-active and effective macroeconomic policies,” he said.
Investment in fixed assets increased by 4.2 percent in the first three months of 2025, while the real estate investment registered a 9.9 percent contraction, extending the crisis that reached the sector in 2022. The urban unemployment rate was 5.2 percent in March, down 5.4 percent in the previous month.
Bonança and Storm
China may have difficulty reaching its official growth objective this year without further stimuli. In recent weeks, several international banks, including the UBS Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc., have lowered their growth forecasts from China to about 4 percent or less, the result of the aggravating commercial tensions with Washington.
Some economists expect China's Popular Bank to reduce interest rates or the amount of money banks should keep in reserve this month, while others provide for several Yuan billion in loans and additional tax expenses to fill the void left by falling exports.
China has to rapidly increase domestic consumption and investment to counteract the impact of tariffs. The weakness of the labor market continues to prevent consumers from spending more, even before US fees reach export -related jobs.
The impact of the trade war will probably speak out of economic activity from April, after an increase of 12.4 percent of exports in March, as companies rushed to complete orders.
The possibility of an agreement between the US and China on commercial dispute seems reduced in the near future, as Beijing chose to retaliate the successive rounds of Tarump -imposed tariffs.
China's scholarship rates largely kept their losses after the disclosure of the data, with Hang Seng China Enterprisses, which brings together the main Chinese Hong Kong companies, losing 2.4 percent, and the CSI 300, which replicates the performance of the 300 main actions traded in the Shanghai and Shenzhen bags, to fall 0.8 percent.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:52:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | Regulator accuses Google of violating anti -monopoly laws</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/japao-regulador-acusa-google-de-violar-leis-antimonopolio/</link><description>Japanese regulatory authorities accused US technology to violate anti-monopoly laws, referring to similar actions in the United States and Europe. Google Japan stated in a statement that it considered action “unfortunate” and the company said it has invested significantly in the country to promote innovation as a technological leader.
The “order of cessation and withdrawal” of Japan's Fair Trade Commission says Google has to stop the Google search engine preinstallation on Android smartphones, which, according to the commission, actually excludes the competition. It is not known if Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., based in Silicone Valley, USA, will take legal action to combat the order.
In the US, a judge decided last year that Google's “omnipresent” search engine illegally explored his dominance to master the competition. Google has denied the allegations, arguing that it is immensely popular because people like what it offers.
Japanese regulators began research on Google in 2023 and say they have consulted foreign authorities who dealt with similar cases. European regulators also criticized what they consider to be Google's monopolistic domain.
Tuesday's decision marks the first time that Japan's Fair Trade Commission takes action against a large world technological company.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:45:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Timor-Leste | Xanana and branches accused of destroying judicial system</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/timor-leste-xanana-e-ramos-horta-acusados-de-destruirem-sistema-judicial/</link><description>Independent Timor-Leste Revolutionary Front Secretary-General Mari Alkatiri, accused President Jose Ramos-Horta yesterday, and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão of destroying the country's judicial system
"I just say that this is an extremely serious situation. Judicial independence is dying, due to the oligarchic dictatorship of two people: the president and the Timorese Prime Minister," said the former head of government Mari Alkatiri, at a press conference held at his office in Dili.
Mari Alkatiri said this is a "dictatorship with a cape of democracy, oriented and controlled." "It is just these two people who know everything and do everything, exercising absolute power, total, taking advantage of the fragility of the judicial system. That's it. I know these two people very well. It is they who do not know me," said the leader of the opposition Timorese.
Mari Alkatiri stressed that those “two figures” are using political power through the National Parliament to make changes and pass laws that undermine the judicial system, giving as an example the changes to the Anti -Corruption Commission Law (CAC) and the law of the judicial organization.
Regarding changes in CAC Law, Mari Alkatiri said that the choice of the manager of that institution was made by a simple majority, when previously was by qualified majority. "This change to the law also demonstrates that, if the CAC commissioner does not work according to the will or guidance of the government, he may fire him at any time," he lamented.
According to Alkatiri, the previous version of the law required consensus in the National Parliament for the commissioner's election, with a five -year term. "Therefore, I consider that this act of government is against the rights of citizens and against the principles of the rule of democratic law," he explained.
Balance dishes
With regard to changes to the law of the Judicial Organization, which began to be debated yesterday in the Timorese Parliament, Mari Alkatiri said they are preparing to allow judges with 20 years of experience to be appointed to the presidency of the Court of Appeal. This means that any judge chosen by the government can be appointed president of the Court of Appeal, said Mari Alkatiri.
For Mari Alkatiri, that type of action is extremely dangerous because it can lead to the death of the rule of democratic law in Timor-Leste and undermine the country's credibility in the world.
In 2023, after taking office as Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmão created a office for reform of the justice sector, led by Lúcia Lobato, former Minister of Justice, alleging weaknesses, scarcity of human resources and lack of response from the system. In an intervention issued in October of that year, the Timorese Prime Minister accused the Timor-Leste justice sector of "inspiring confidence" with society and implying that corruption only happens in "a particular segment."</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:44:15</pubDate></item><item><title>Real Estate | New houses prices fall for the 22nd consecutive month</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/imobiliario-precos-de-casas-novas-caem-pelo-22o-mes-consecutivo/</link><description>The prices of new houses in China fell for the 22nd consecutive month in March, despite the government's measures to wage the prolonged sector crisis. Prices in 70 selected cities fell 0.11 percent, compared to the previous month, according to data released yesterday by the Asian National Statistics Office (GNE). The fall in February was the same percentage value.
Among the localities mentioned, 41 registered descents in the prices of new houses compared to 45 in February. Among these, 24 - including some important such as Shanghai or Shenzhen - registered increases, more than the previous month (18).
GNE data also revealed a 0.2 percent drop in the price of secondhand houses in March, a more moderate pace than the one recorded in the previous month (0.3 percent). In the case of this type of real estate, 56 of the 70 cities registered descents, four remained at the same level as in December and ten registered climbs.
In recent months, Chinese authorities have continued to announce measures to wrap the real estate market, an issue that worries Beijing due to their implications for social stability, as housing is one of the main investment vehicles of Chinese families.
One of the main causes of the recent softening of the Chinese economy is precisely the crisis of the real estate sector, whose weight in national GDP - adding the indirect factors - was estimated at about 30 percent, according to some analysts.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:42:25</pubDate></item><item><title>Malaysia alongside China in the field of trade</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/malasia-ao-lado-da-china-em-materia-de-comercio/</link><description>Malaysia “is next to China” in the field of commerce, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said yesterday at the beginning of a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Southeast Asian country. "We are next to the Chinese government, for the well-being of our people and our national economic interests, as well as for the general development and stability of our country," Anwar told Chinese state television CGTN.
Xi, who is visiting a week to three Southeast Asian countries, was received by a 21-shot salary upon arriving at the National Palace for an audience with the king of Malaysia, sultan Ibrahim Iskandar, accompanied by Prime Minister Anwar.
The visit occurs at a time when Xi tries to introduce his country as a defender of free trade and a source of stability to countries in the region, which are the main targets of the tariff war launched by US leader Donald Trump.
Beijing and Kuala Lumpur are expected to sign agreements designed to increase Malaysian exports, including palm and durião oil, increase the influx of tourists and Chinese students to Southeast Asia and Chinese technology sharing in sectors such as renewable energy.
On the other hand, analysts have warned that China expects Malaysia and its Southeast Asian neighbors to support it as the main power of the region - an alignment that could cause a reaction from Washington.
ASEAN Extension
In Malaysia, Xi should discuss a free trade agreement between China and the 10 members of the Southeast Asian Nations Association (Asean), as Malaysia chairs the association this year.
Quoted by the Chinese press, Asean's secretary-general Kao Kim Hourn said the deal will eliminate many of the customs between China and the block members. "We will reduce the rates to zero in many cases and then expand them to all areas," he said in an interview with CGTN.
Malaysia is the headquarters of several projects of the track and route initiative, including a Chinese rail project worth $ 11.2 billion. China is also the largest commercial partner and one of Malaysia's main direct foreign investment sources. Xi has already visited Vietname and leaves to Cambodia.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:41:08</pubDate></item><item><title>Hong Kong | Sending orders to the United States suspended</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/hong-kong-envio-de-encomendas-para-os-estados-unidos-suspenso/</link><description>Hong Kong's post office yesterday announced the suspension of ordering orders to the United States in response to the imposition, "abusive", tariffs by US authorities. Postcards with documents only, without goods, will not be affected
 
"The Hongkong Post will not definitely charge any customs rates on behalf of the US and will suspend the acceptance of postal shipments containing goods destined to the US," says a post office.
For orders via maritime and terrestrial, the decision has immediate effect “due to longer shipping”, and for the air mail, comes into force on April 27, the note indicates.
In the case of “surface mail with goods that have not yet been issued to the US,” the Hongkong Post will organize the return and reimbursement of sizes from April 22. The United States “are not being reasonable, they are intimidating and imposing customs rights abusively,” says the statement.
Donald Trump signed an executive order last week that ends the exemptions of customs rights on small orders from China, such as those sent by the giants of E -commerce Shein and Temu.
China and the United States have entered the scale for fares: Washington imposed over-thexes of 145 percent on Chinese products entering American territory, and those that existed before Donald Trump's return to the White House. Beijing retaliated with a rate that now reaches the 125 percent.
A presidential decree issued by Donald Trump in 2020 eliminated the preferential treatment granted to Hong Kong. The ancient British colony is therefore equally affected by the 145 percent surcharge imposed on China.
"For the sending of articles to the US, Hong Kong audiences must be prepared to pay exorbitant and irrational rates due to the Unreasible and Aggressive acts of the US. The other postcards containing only documents, without commodities, will not be affected," concluded the Hongkong Post.
Letter response
The Chinese Communist Party's main official for Hong Kong and Macao affairs and the leaders of the governments of both regions accused the United States of imposing tariffs to sabotage China. "The US has targeted our tariffs, they target our own survival," said Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau affairs, under the protection of the State Council.
"Although Hong Kong is the largest source of US commercial surplus, the United States still imposed high tariffs. This is extremely arrogant and blatant," said Xia. The US continued the leader, "cannot tolerate Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and are the biggest sinister manipulator that undermines human rights, freedom, rule of law, prosperity and stability in Hong Kong."
Chinese administrative government leader John Lee Ka-Chiu accused the United States of, in a "wicked logic," imposing tariffs to protect his "unhealthy hegemony." "The United States oppose free trade, interrupt global trade and supply chains (…), severely damaging the multilateral trade system and the process of globalization," said John Lee.
Also the leader of the Macao Executive criticized, on the same day, the United States for the "abusive imposition of customs taxes on all its business partners," including China, "under various pretexts." During the inauguration of an exhibition due to National Security Education Day, Sam Hou Fai said Washington "severely devastated the multilateral trade system (...) and impaired the stability of the world economic order."
Lusa asked Macao's post office if the company will follow the same steps from its Hong Kong counterpart, but the postal department did not respond in a timely manner.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:39:09</pubDate></item><item><title>Singapore | Dissolved Parliament paves the way to general elections</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/singapura-parlamento-dissolvido-abre-caminho-a-eleicoes-gerais/</link><description>The Parliament of Singapore has been dissolved, paving the way for general elections in which the Popular Action Party (PAP), which has long ruled the country, will try to strengthen its dominion, under the command of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. The Electoral Department set May 3 as a date for the elections.
The victory has been practically guaranteed to PAP, which leads Singapore since its independence in 1965. Wong, who took office as Singapore's fourth leader in May last year, wants to win a more robust victory after the PAP suffered a setback in the 2020 elections due to the growing discontent of voters with the government.
Wong succeeded Lee Hsien Loong, who resigned after two decades in charge of the country. Lee's departure marked the end of a family dynasty began by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, the first Singapore leader who turned the island into one of the richest nations in the world during his 31st years.
In the 2020 elections, held during the Covid-19 pandemic, PAP maintained the absolute majority, with 83 of the 93 parliamentary seats, but lost places for the opposition, which increased parliamentary representation from six to 10, the largest ever registered.</description><pubDate>2025-04-16 01:40:38</pubDate></item><item><title>Tariffs | UBS points to economic growth of 3.4%</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/tarifas-ubs-aponta-para-crescimento-economico-de-34/</link><description>The UBS AG added yesterday to a series of low-chinese economy growth reviews the most pessimistic forecast among major banks, predicting that only 3.4 percent will expand this year, reflecting the impact of US tariffs.
The Swiss bank, which previously foresaw a 4 percent growth in 2025, maintained its estimate for next year in 3 percent. Both forecasts are the lowest of all projections compiled by Bloomberg agency.
"Tariff shock puts unprecedented challenges to exports to China and will trigger a major adjustment to the home economy," wrote UBS economists, including Tao Wang, in a note published yesterday.
Goldman Sachs Group and Citigroup are among the global banks that have reduced their prospects for China in recent days, with most economists doubting that Beijing can achieve the official growth objective of about 5 percent this year.
If the current increases in customs rates are maintained, it is likely to drag China's Gross Domestic Product growth at more than 2 percent, despite the expected additional stimuli of Beijing, according to the UBS. Economists admitted that their opinion has “high margins of error” due to the “extremely large uncertainty” surrounding the ongoing trade war.
Exports to the US should fall two thirds in the next quarters and the total shipments abroad may fall 10% in dollars this year, they added.
"We think that some of China's other business partners will also be able to increase rates on Chinese products in the coming months, but probably only about specific products and not in magnitudes similar to US tariffs," they said.</description><pubDate>2025-04-16 01:35:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Xi Jinping honors Ho Chi Minh with a visit to his mausoleum</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/xi-jinping-homenageia-ho-chi-minh-com-visita-ao-seu-mausoleu/</link><description>Chinese President Xi Jinping yesterday honored the Vietname Independence Hero, Ho Chi Minh, with a visit to his mausoleum in Hanoi, as part of a visit to the country integrated in a journey through Southeast Asia.

Vice-rector Álvaro Barbosa expects, soon, the increase in master's students from 30 to 200. Regarding the internationalization of higher education, the official advocates changes in student visas to facilitate recruitment
 
Does the recruitment of students from the interior of China remain a matter pending to the University of Saint Joseph?
It is a process that is underway. We have had huge support from the Macao government in negotiations to obtain the quota for our university, and they have been tireless in the effort to try to resolve the issues raised by the central government. Many of the questions are legitimate and concern concerns that arise. We were granted a temporary quota of 30 students for masters ago over a probative period, which served to evaluate how we, as Western University, would host students from China. From China, there is this concern with the host of students in Macau. I think we have made a huge effort and the students who are there, included in this contingent, are quite satisfied.
Is this quota for masters just?
Yes. For a degree we do not have authorization yet. In this way, we are currently at the time we try to overcome this probative period in order to obtain a quota of about 200 students for masters. We are in the final phase of the evaluation process and everything has been doing well. We will have the possibility that, next academic year, expand this quota. That would be great, because for our university, to have a greater impact of our mission in Macao, it is essential to have access to students from mainland China. We cannot be a university in an integrated region in a country like China, and not contact with students from China.
Is it more difficult for USJ to compete with other universities, such as those of Hong Kong, by foreign students, outside China?
The issue of recruitment of international students has become a priority for Macao universities. In the last two or three years, it has become evident that this internationalization is very important. What difficulty is there? There is the issue related to student visas, as these visas currently do not allow students to do any kind of work, denying them that minimum local subsistence mechanism to be able to meet expenses. Nor is it contemplated the possibility of, when the student concludes his formation, to be in the territory and find work. What all countries and regions that are competitive in higher education do, such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Australia, is to have incentive policies. Allow students to work part -time, for example. In Hong Kong when a degree ends, the student can stay in the territory up to a maximum of two years to find a job. This kind of measures do not yet exist in Macau, but I think the government is pondering this possibility. From the moment the decision was made that the internationalization of higher education was important, this must be accompanied with the corresponding measures. The current student visa is extremely limiting and does not encourage the coming to Macao to study, only allows coming. This issue was not as present as it is now, but now there is a strategic policy of internationalization.
É também uma questão de sobrevivência para as universidades locais. 
Sim. Talvez não haja maior exemplo de catalisador da diversificação da economia de Macau do que o ensino superior. Temos dez instituições, 60 mil alunos em cerca de 700 mil habitantes. É esse o potencial da internacionalização, o de fomentar a diversificação.

And also the research that comes out of higher education.
The investigation, the dynamics of the work that is done. There are a number of vectors that higher education brings to a region or country, this happened to Portugal, for example, with the policy of doctoral scholarships for students from abroad, which completely changed the dynamics of higher education. Cape Verde developed thanks to the impact of higher education.
Then we need to make the system more flexible in Macau.
I don't know if it's a matter of having a holistic view of strategy. There may be an idea, but then it does not intervene in all the necessary dimensions to achieve a certain goal. But I am very optimistic. I believe this new student policy is a key step to be taken in Macau. The internationalization strategy followed by all these countries and regions I spoke, and were successful in capturing international students, was always the same. No need to invent much. First, one should increase the capacity and notoriety of universities, and then a policy of scholarships, which will enhance a student flow, creating a reference for the territory, so that studying there becomes a habit. After this flow of students for a few years, an image is already created and some scholarships can be removed, which students will continue to choose a particular territory to study in it. Australia has a huge higher education industry, for example, and I think that in Macau we just have to follow the same strategies. We do, at USJ, that a little.
How, in concrete terms?
We offer many scholarships, and in this sense the Diocese of Macao has helped us build this flow of international students that allow us to create this dynamic that we hope will be sustainable by itself in the future. I think the government is also doing this. There have always been scholarships in Macau, attributed mainly by the Macau Foundation, but this measure will be strengthened. Solving the student's visa issue, creating a scholarship incentive system for five to ten years, Macau will have a bright future as an international higher education destination. But we need to invest, continue, and it takes a few years.
USJ created the “Macau Hub” platform, in partnership with the Macau Scientific and Cultural Center (CCCM) in 2023. At what stage is this project?
This project has to do with our interest in developing a relationship dynamic of Lusophone countries centered in Lisbon in the area of ​​entrepreneurship, first. This cabinet we have at CCCM is not intended to offer training in Portugal, but we want to do something else. As we are positioned in the Great Bay and with Hengqin, where it is intended to activate a business ecosystem, we want to take advantage of the fact that we have relations with the Lusophone world to activate the access of the startups of Portugal, Brazil and Angola, above all, to the great bay and hengqin. We are trying to create a kind of incubator of transnational companies, in which we support the development of Lusophone businesses that want to settle in the large bay and also the reverse system. Strategically, for a university, it is absolutely fundamental to have a dynamic in the area of ​​entrepreneurship. Currently, more than half of our students do not want to go to the corporate world, but create their own businesses. Just as universities have to have employability solutions, they also have to have them for entrepreneurs, who are increasingly. So a university has to have a business incubator. My vision of the future for higher education goes around: a university, besides having a library and canteen, will also have its own business incubator. I would say that most students of management or economy courses dream of having their own business, especially in China. China is perhaps one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world. The CCCM welcomes this initiative in Portugal, but we also work with the Portuguese Catholic University.
And concrete results, already have it?
We have a number of small initial projects that are starting now, and we also work with many business organizations. We have now negotiated a series of projects, and I think everything will develop very quickly, based on the manifestations of interest we have. We were in Angola in December and we have already aligned a series of initiatives, we also have projects with Brazil and Portugal.</description><pubDate>2025-04-07 22:56:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Adelina Moura, teacher and trainer: “The mobile phone is like a Swiss knife”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/07/adelina-moura-docente-e-formadora-o-telemovel-e-como-um-canivete-suico/</link><description>Graduated in the area of ​​educational technologies, Adelina Moura will conduct lectures to parents, students and teachers about the use of digital technologies in classrooms, within the “Letters &amp; Company” festival of the Portuguese Institute of the East. The teacher understands that prohibiting mobile phone in schools is not a solution
 
What are the challenges felt by teachers with the introduction of technologies in the classroom? Can the mobile phone actually be a complement to learning?
Yes. I've been saying this since 2005. The mobile phone can be an excellent learning tool, a means to motivate students and to enrich their learning. We have a kind of Swiss knife here, a very powerful equipment in the hands of the students and there is a school failure, because they do not work and help students enhance this equipment they have. What happens is that students learn in the worst way, in a destructed way, by attempt-rrove. There is a gap, as students are not alerted to the positive potential for mobile phone use. They face their mobile phones as a free time use, spending time on social networks and scrolling, and time consumes. It is essential that teachers are users, in their practices, mobile phones, and for the preparation of classes and other projects, to know how to prepare students. I consider that the school has lost several stages of students' preparation and awareness to use these equipment that lead to classes and with which schools have not spent any money. With the prohibition of bringing the mobile phone to the classroom we did not advance anything in this regard.
During the pandemic period, for example, the use of technologies, with distance learning, was quite enhanced.
But during the pandemic we also burned some steps regarding the use of digital by teachers, because before the pandemic many teachers did not believe or used. They thought it was a fashion and they saw no use in the use of mobile phones and other technologies. With the pandemic the use of these equipment proved that without them the situation of education would have been much worse. In these pandemic years, teachers have become more aware of the technologies that already exist and are available to anyone. With internet access on mobile phone, something that has existed since 2007 with the launch of the first iPhone, the e-learning system is enhanced and then we move to “Mobile Learning”, where you can learn anywhere and anytime with mobile devices. It is this reality that we see a little away from school.
And after the pandemic, how has it been?
I think we will take a few more steps towards digital literacy. With Artificial Intelligence (IA), it seems that we are as in the phase I created my first website in 1999 or email in 1995. We are at the beginning. But it is 30 years of technology where there have been many changes, and technology in fact goes on and if we immediately do not realize what we have available, we and students, we help create a moat that has happened in the past compared to digital. In the face of AI, if we do not look back and do not realize what was not done and should have been at school level, we are wasting time. Only a few years from now will people be alert to AI, and the gap is increasing. Hence it is very important to bet now, in this early stage, in the training of teachers, students and families.
Is there much ignorance of parents, removal from this reality?
We have parents who are from this century. That is, they were born with the existence of computers, internet, saw the appearance of the smartphone. But when they studied, the school did not talk about the potential of digital. So these former students came to society and did not bring this sensitivity to digital, to educate their children. We teachers, when we do digital training, are doing good to society because we are also preparing these young people for the future, because they will be parents and should be aware of educating their children. At school we do not only prepare for the job market, but for personal and family life. Hence teacher education is essential. The invitation I received from IPOR seems to me an excellent holistic view of everything, because the school includes several actors, connecting with society.
How should AI be introduced into the classroom?
We currently watch changes in search engines, in fact. We have search engines created from root to Age Age, for example. The best way to introduce AI into the classroom is to ask students and how they use it, and already resort to this tool. At the beginning of the academic year I always ask students to answer a questionnaire about their digital routines, and then I know more or less their practices. In 2023, when the chatgPT came out, I introduced AI in my classes, and realized that students were using this tool to deceive the teachers. Students have to realize that when using AI, they are falling into a certain trap because they are not learning. It is the law of the lowest effort, equal to the phase in which the internet emerged, when students selected, copied and sent to the teacher. We now have the problem that the answers are in Brazilian Portuguese, for example, and see as soon as I was used. We have, therefore, to dismantle this action in the heads and face them. I tell them that they are being intellectually dishonest and that they have not read the AI ​​response, for example. Since 2023, I feel that students, in the answers to this questionnaire I do, say they are afraid to use chatgpt because they are afraid of being caught by teachers. That is, it seems to have gained some conscience.
It will give these lectures in a different educational context in Asia, where the use of mobile phone can be earlier. How will you deal with these differences, or do you understand that the problems of using technology in the classroom are transversal?
It is a transverse question. Do we have to wonder if the use of a particular equipment and tool will make us wiser? It seems to me not, because we may have the equipment, but the use we make it varies a lot. I tell my students that they should be ashamed, because they have much easier access to content than in my time, when we truly had to do research and read in physical format. I tell them that with this technology they should all have a grade 20, and that they are wasting resources, being dishonest intellectually, because they sign works that are not theirs and do not read, even, they deliver. One of the works we have with students is to teach them how to make bibliographic references, refer to the sources. But I am an optimistic by nature, and I hope that in a decade, secondary education students who are fathers and mothers will be able to deal with these problems of social networks and increase fraud with their children. It is this “parents school” that the school can help create. We are in a moment with no return of digital, and forbidding is the most comfortable situation, but it is not the best to face reality. We have to use the right words to alert. We have in this time of alerts and consciences, encouraging the critical spirit of our students, which is little today.

Speaking to HM, the academic enhances the interconnection between tourism, economy and geography, and lists its possibilities, limitations and effects, including Macao
 
 
In this book it speaks of the concept of “spatial economy”, in connection with tourism and geography. How is this connection?
Economic geography combines the geographical context with economic processes, being studied the spatial distribution of economic activities. The economy of tourism is particularly sensitive to these geographical constraints, as they are the characteristics of each place that enhances the development of certain products or services. These characteristics widely exceed the physical aspects of the territory and also include culture, history, ways of life or even institutions and legal frameworks. The case of casino, something particularly important in Macao, is a good example of the importance of legal aspects to develop certain types of tourism. Economic geography has a wider scope than the spatial economy, more focused on strictly economic aspects. Being evident in tourism this relationship between economics and geography, this book establishes a double approach that systematizes the interdependence of these three aspects it refers. First explores how the concepts and theories of economic geography can apply to tourism. In the second half it makes the opposite route, discussing how the analysis of relevant problems of contemporary tourism justifies the use of economic geography. Examples are the degradation of local resources, environmental impacts, contribution to climate change, acceleration of gentrification processes or disturbance of community modes of life.
Can having an excessively -dependent economy of tourism constitute a problem or salvation?
The two things, and are both cases that economic geography can help to understand. The industrialization of economies is linked to the agglomeration processes of activities that reinforce each other when they reach a certain scale. This allows the massification of production and consumption, with reasonable costs. Contemporary industries, more associated with the integration of digital technologies and creative processes, are less clustered in specialized industrial development zones, but tend to focus on large cities and metropolitan areas. It also follows that rural areas, islands, or sites that have not followed industrialization processes, have more difficulty mobilizing investments, technologies or qualified people to innovate and develop new industries. In such cases, tourism often appears as the possible solution as it can be developed with incorporation of technology and relatively low knowledge. On the other hand, tourism consumption, not being essential to human life, is very sensitive to income fluctuations.
Can you give examples?
This was visible, for example, with the 2007/2009 international crisis. Tourism is also very vulnerable to safety problems or international epidemics, such as COVID-19 has demonstrated to the extreme. Economies too specialized in tourism are very vulnerable to external shocks and less resilient to crises. It is also visible that, being the tourist development often supported by intensive and weak labor services, the specialization in tourism can cause, in the long run, embarrassment in terms of population qualifications, the ability to innovate and integrate technology or to add value to the regional economy.
The book also speaks of “intelligent tourism” and “co-creation of experiences”, using the megados and IA. Is tourism definitely becoming more digital?
Social networks are fundamental instruments for new generations. However, they began to generalize the tools for planning or promotion of travel supported by artificial intelligence. The so-called “intelligent tourism” more generally designates the use of digital technologies to intensify information flows, consolidate the formation of networks and promote more informed and shared decision making, eventually contributing to the so-called “co-creation of experiences”. Tourism digitization has its origins in service distribution systems originally developed by airlines since the 1960s, but it would be the internet to accelerate and globalize digitization.
And social networks.
The emergence of social networks promoted the creation of a more interactive universe, potentially in real time and involving wide numbers of users and various types of supports. The generalization of the use of mobile phones permanently connected to the Internet, even on foreign travel, has further increased this potential for intensive and interactive use of data and information. This "co-creation", however, hides obvious imbalances of power.
Such as?
With regard to tourists, or consumer in general, it is usually the role of providing information, for example through social networks. This information is obtained, accumulated and marketed, sometimes without consent or even without knowledge, to eventually translate into the creation, adaptation or promotion of products and services. This process is particularly important in the case of tourism, because there is usually a long period between the decision to travel and the trip itself. This period of travel exploration and planning is used by tourist marketing companies to try to influence choices. This type of interaction also introduces a difference in the “spatiality” of the provision of tourist services, which are usually produced and consumed at the same time and in the same place, in a direct relationship between producer and consumer. The digitization of tourism anticipates most of these interactions and information flows and transfers them to large technological companies or marketing and distribution.
In a world where more and more travel, the routes are shorter and access to information is immense, how can countries and regions be competitive in the tourist offer?
Contemporary tourism lives in a highly competitive international environment. But just as there is a wide variety of destinations and offerings, there is also a wide range of preferences and consumption, what is called “hyper-personalization”, the result of such abundance of information and opportunity for interaction. The challenge that is placed on destinations is to identify the resources, products and services that can be adjusted to a particular group of consumers, to communicate effectively. This competitiveness greatly goes beyond the strict scope of tourist services because it also requires mobility and transportation services, varied infrastructure, safety, medical support, or easy communication. Anywhere you want to develop your tourist industry have to intervene about all these factors.
The book also addresses how “social processes” shape the development of tourism. In the case of China, for example, do you believe we are watching a change, which will have consequences for Macau?
It seems to me that Macau is in a highly privileged position to develop other forms of tourism. China is the largest issuing market in the world, the widespread rise of income in recent decades allows many million people to explore the opportunity to travel. Macao is a very close and distinct destination, with its historical and cultural particularities. For the Chinese population it was not easy to visit Macau and there is certainly a great interest.
How does the Great Bay project come in this?
The strategy that is being followed by integrating the Great Bay allows you to develop a cosmopolitan and diverse offer that can certainly attract Chinese tourists and other parts of the world. Moreover, these three areas have excellent hotel and tourism schools, which guarantee qualified personnel for tourism management and planning. The element of differentiation that Portuguese culture introduces in this context can certainly contribute to the success of the transition from a casinos focused on other forms that value culture and heritage more.
Is it possible to have sustainable tourism?
The problems and difficulties of tourism sustainability are more visible than in other sectors. This “spatiality” of tourism (where the consumer is obliged to move to the place of consumption) implies that the consequences of this consumption become more evident. These effects are less obvious when it comes to the unsustainability of industrial units or intensive forms of agriculture in relatively isolated areas. As mass reduction and investment reduction strategies also apply to tourism, the consequences of the environment or the quality of life of residents in destinations can be devastating. Sustainability implies a long -term perspective based on the idea that today's decisions do not imply future negative consequences. Sustainable practices depend on the control of the impacts that accumulate over time by individual and independent economic agents.
How can this control be done?
When a hotel or airline defines what ability to install on their services they may eventually estimate the impact that consumers will have on the local environment or economy. They will have more difficulties in anticipating that impacts will be generated in the next 10, 15 or 20 years to investment. And surely it will be impossible to measure how this impact accumulates the impacts caused by other service providers, now or in the future. In other words, although the idea of ​​sustainability is widespread accepted, economic agents do not have mechanisms or instruments in practice. Regulating the use of resources and territories by public entities with a more comprehensive and future perspective can contribute to the sustainability more effectively than the regulation associated with market dynamics, which in many cases has been revealed highly predatory. The Chinese economy is one of these examples and may eventually benefit from it.
And in the concrete case of Macau?
Macao has historically known problems: ultra-urbanized and polluted areas, with large energy consumption and waste production; Great concentration of tourists in a relatively small area of ​​great historical and cultural interest; Great dependence on the game, with the resulting imbalances in the appropriation of tourism benefits. The ongoing transition to new forms of tourism should better solve these problems and state regulation will certainly have better results than based on market dynamics.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:28:16</pubDate></item><item><title>José Paulo Esperança, Associate Rector of the City of Macau University: “Languages ​​cannot be controlled”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/01/jose-paulo-esperanca-reitor-associado-da-universidade-cidade-de-macau-as-linguas-nao-podem-ser-controladas/</link><description>Co-author of the “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, with Luís Reto and Fernando Luís Machado, José Paulo Esperança reveals to HM that the work edited in 2016 and 2018 is being updated, especially due to the growing global value of the language.

Launched the “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, in co-authorship, about the global value of the language. Plan a new edition or update?
Undoubtedly. We are working in this regard, there was a recent conference in Macao and Professor Luís Reto, former Rector of ISCTE, presented some more current elements that were developed. He has worked on a very important issue, which is the role of Portuguese as a frank language, which was for a few centuries in Asia. The exchange between Dutch and the kingdom of Zion was made in Portuguese, because it was the common language used at that time, before English became the contemporary frank language. Therefore, there is a whole interesting story of Portuguese and the role it had in the first pinyins that existed, with the Chinese and the use of the [Roman] alphabet in Vietname. There are a number of elements that are not, therefore, very publicized, and the work of Atlas is the same, to disclose some economic dimensions of the language.
What are these dimensions?
One is the exchange of foreign trade and investment, which is very facilitated by the language. We also talk about migrations, tourism, students' exchange that is greatly influenced by linguistic proximity. Therefore, today we have a set of elements that are very interesting, and we hope to develop some more important partnerships with Macau.
As?
More at work, Professor Luís Reto is doing, which maintains an investigation team about the value of Portuguese. He has collaborated with the Portuguese Language Museum of São Paulo, for example. It is a museum space that was renewed after the fire that destroyed it. In addition, there is a project with Cascais City Council to develop such a structure, and we hope to do some works with Macau, in order to create three poles for the projection of the Portuguese language. As for Atlas' materials, we would like to have a continued update model, as this data is out of date very quickly. The work was edited in many languages, including Mandarin. This is the moment when we would like to give the book a more historical and deep dimension, with more knowledge about the teaching of Portuguese in the world.
What balance does this teaching do today?
Portuguese is developing a great deal of mother tongue and is effectively one of the most expanding languages ​​due to demographic growth in Africa, with countries such as Angola and Mozambique, which around 2050 will have populations of over 100 million inhabitants, each. The Portuguese thus consolidates itself as a language of the southern hemisphere, but much more from Africa, supplanting Brazil itself as the place of largest number of speakers of the language. All of this generates enormous potential, and this also occurs due to the great exchange of universities and internationalization of teaching. Today there is the possibility of Portuguese being a language of science, there is more publications in this language. This is a great challenge because English is the contemporary language of scientists. We want to contribute to all these dimensions, and Macau can also play an important role there. Macao is indeed a platform between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, and can play a significant role.
Is Macao an ideal place to train Portuguese teachers who do not have Portuguese as a mother tongue? Do you fear that the territory loses relevance in this matter before the offer of courses in the interior of China?
I see this question more as complementarity than competition. We have identified about 60 higher education institutions in China that have Portuguese courses, but I think Macau has very interesting conditions to start teaching from primary to secondary education so that children have been able to have learning from an early age. It does not mean that there are no young Chinese who began to learn their tongue in adolescence that they speak fantastically, which surprises me, but it is easier to start earlier and earlier. This will be easier in Macau. What is important is to create conditions for greater economic collaboration to many levels, such as joint research. In this respect, Macau has a very interesting opportunity. At the City of Macau University we are very interested in increasingly collaborating with researchers who visit us and work with our teams.
Can you give me examples?
Brazil is today one of China's great business partners. There is a lot of exchange in both directions, but one of the themes that is little studied, and in which I work hard, is the internationalization of Chinese companies. To what extent do these companies follow a model of internationalization similar to that of other countries that started this process earlier? I speak of the United States of America, the European countries, but also of Japan and others. China has, in fact, different models of presence in countries that are not yet well known, and this is important to realize, so that we know how to facilitate this process of exchange in a world that lives periods of some setback. It is very sad. I always remember a great economist of Portuguese origin, David Ricardo, who clearly explained how world trade is beneficial to everyone and how countries can take advantage of this situation. Therefore, applying tariffs, making such commercial barriers harms countries that are major exporters, such as China or Germany, and countries that today have a cultural export capacity, for example, and are not just importers.
In relation to the new Orthographic Agreement. It continues without a standardization in Macau. Does it worry it?
Languages ​​are dynamic and cannot be controlled. We think today in English, and we realize that there are almost incomprehensible ways to each other, such as the English one in Nigeria or Australia. Americans have difficulty realizing the Australians. In the nineteenth century, Portuguese from Portugal and Brazil were closer, then some disagreement emerged. There was an effort in Brazil to propose an orthographic agreement, and the Portuguese joined, resulting in a series of negotiations. There have always been resistances. I remember that Fernando Pessoa suggested the famous phrase “My homeland is the Portuguese language”. It was curiously a manifestation of some conservatism, because he thought Pharmacy had to continue writing with pH [Pharmacia]. In fact it did not make much sense. Portugal ended up seeking to impose a certain standardization based on the most genetic changes in the spelling agreement. It is not a process that has been running a hundred percent well, and has been universally adopted. African countries have become more defenders of Portuguese from Portugal. There is sometimes some confusion, but I understand that intercomprehension still remains, achieving a homogeneous language, more perhaps than English.

José Paulo Esperança is a doctorate in Economics from the European University Institute and was president of the ISCTE Department of Finance and Accounting - University Institute of Lisbon. The “New Atlas of the Portuguese Language”, with editions in 2016 and 2018, contains “a large set of indicators that reinforce the idea of ​​the growth of teaching, speakers and the written use of Portuguese in the world”, having been the target of a series of recent initiatives in Macao.
One of them took place on March 17, at the Rui Cunha Foundation, with a session of the “Roda de Ideas” cycle, entitled “The Potential of the Portuguese Language in the Contemporary World”, which was attended by the former ISCTE Rector, Luís Reto, and José Paulo Hope himself.

He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive, kind mood and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose their own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GT Cup Right-Great Bay Race decides on Pingtan</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/09/apuramento-da-taca-gt-corrida-da-grande-baia-decide-se-em-pingtan/</link><description>The second test of the GT Cup - Race of the Great Bay of the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix will not be played at the Zhuhai International Circuit, as initially planned, but at the International Circuit of Lago Ruyi, in the Pingtan tourist region in Fuzhou.
Sro Cup's debut season calendar was finally defined yesterday, with the official announcement of confirmation that Pingtan's semi-permanent circuit will host the third and fourth rounds of the GT4 cars on June 28 and 29. Pingtan thus joins Shanghai, Beijing and Macau in this year's calendar of the championship launched by Sro Asia in partnership with the Macau-China General Automobile Association (AAMC).
The Pingtan track replaces Zhuhai, which was on the provisional calendar released in January, but could not confirm his event. This new date is also no coincidence, as the Sro GT Cup event will be part of the Pingtan-Macau cultural activities scheduled for June.
Pingtan's picturesque - which combines modern and coastal urban scenarios - remains widely unknown outside China. Inaugurated in 2022, the circuit has two strokes that incorporate existing public roads on the island of Pingtan, sections built from root and permanent boxes. Both SRO GT Cup races will take place in the 2.9 -kilometer circuit and 14 curves, already used by national championships such as China Endurance Championship (CEC) and the Chinese Formula 4 Championship.
Promising start
The 2025 Sro Cup season has spectacularly tore with 33 cars - GT4's largest grill ever gathered in Asia - to play two Formula 1 China Grand Prix Races last month. Integrated in the F1 official program, Chen Weian (Audi) and Lichao Han (Toyota) won the two races that will serve as the basis for the selection of competitors entitled to participate this year in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race.
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, which takes place at the end of the season, on the streets of Macau. The places will be assigned based on the classification after this second round, scheduled for Pingtan. In the dispute for a vacancy were in Shanghai six pilots of the MSAR: Kevin Leong Ian Veng, Miguel Lei, Cheng Tou Wong, Wai Ming Fok, Kim Hou Lao and Un Hous IP.
Charles enters the right foot
Still in the GT events, but in Australia, Macao pilot Charles Leong Hon Chio won the two races of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia inaugural journey in Sydney. The young rider of the territory, behind the wheel of SJM Theodore Racing's Lamborghini Huracán EVO2, has authored the two races played at Sydney Motorsport Park with authority, team with Irish Alex Denning.
Following a sensational season opening, the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia returns to the action next month, with the second round on the stage of the China Grand Prix, the International Shangoi Circuit, from May 16 to 18. After finishing second in 2024, Charles Leong is determined to win the title of the Italian brand competition in Asia in 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-04-09 23:47:39</pubDate></item><item><title>MOTOR EMBALISM | Leong repeats Lamborghini trophy with Theodore</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/02/automobilismo-leong-repete-trofeu-lamborghini-com-a-theodore/</link><description>The Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia starts this weekend in Australia. The monomocrete competition of the prestigious super -sports builder will have, once again, with a representation of the MSAR. Charles Leong Hon Chio will be again at the service of SJM Theodore Racing.
After last season Charles Leong and SJM Theodore Racing fought for the Pro class title to the last race, this duo will continue in 2025. However, the winner of the Macao 4 Grand Prix of Formula 4 by 2020 and 2021 will not form a team with Japanese Miki Koyama. Beside his side, the Macau pilot will now have young Irish Alex Denning, who last year competed at the European Series GT4 and will make his debut on Asian tracks.
Also new is in the SJM's assistance team Theodore Racing, which is no longer Iron Lynx-a structure that, since 2021, controls Prema Powertaam ​​through Swiss company DC Racing Solutions Ltd. The relationship of Iron Lynx with Lamborghini Squadra Corso, an entity responsible for the Italian brand automotive sport, deteriorated dramatically at the end of last year Due to a conflict related to the FIA ​​Endurance World Championship program (WEC). As a result, Iron Lynx has abandoned all activities with the brand of Sant'Agata Bolognese globally.
Given this scenario, to ensure technical assistance to its Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo Evo 2, SJM Theodore Racing will feature this season with the services of DW Evans GT, the team that, last year, won the Team Championship and the Asian trophy class, with the English-based English and co-owner of the team, Dan Wells.
There is no coincidence with the GP
The Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia intends to keep its momentum by 2025, with a calendar composed of six events in six different countries. The season will start, for the first time, in Australia, with the historic Sydney Motorsport Park to receive the first double round. Then the competition heads for Shanghai, China, for the second round on the weekend from June 16 to 18, marking its return to the calendar in 2024 after a four -year absence. Japan will be the host of the third round two weeks later, at the iconic Fuji track, while the Inje Speedium in South Korea enters the calendar in late July.
After having previously hosted the opening round of the season, Sepang, Malaysia, passes to September in 2025, occupying the fifth round of the calendar. The sixth and last race will take place at the Misano Circuit in Italy, together with the Lamborghini world finals. For the first time in several years, the event will not coincide with the Macao Grand Prix, competing in the previous weekend.
Absence of figure
Pro--class winner in 2024, along with Chinese Jason Fangping Chen, André Couto will not be present in this year's edition of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia. Madness Racing Team, whereby the Portuguese territory pilot competed last season, abandoned the trophy and has not yet defined his sports project for 2025. For this first race in the championship in Australia, there are twenty -three cars that will be driven by thirty -nine pilots.</description><pubDate>2025-04-02 23:01:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Table Tennis | Jieni Shao eliminated in the group phase of the World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/17/tenis-de-mesa-jieni-shao-eliminada-na-fase-de-grupos-da-taca-do-mundo/</link><description>The Portuguese Jieni Shao was eliminated yesterday from the Table Tennis World Cup in Macao, losing with Chinese Wang Yidi, the third of the world ranking, in the last game of the group stage.
The two players came to the last match to need a victory to be first in Group 3, the only position that guaranteed the passage to the qualifiers. This after, on Tuesday, the favorite Wang was surprised by the 39-year-old French veteran Yuan Jia Nan, who won three partials to one.
On Monday, at the premiere of the competition, Shao, current 52nd of the world ranking and the only Portuguese representative in the tournament, had tied two partials with Yuan, 44th in the world. In addition to winning the meeting, which lasted 27 minutes, for four partials to zero, the third in the world secured access to the qualifiers.
The World Cup will take place until Doming in Macao for the second year in a row, after a four-year break due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The tournament will distribute total awards worth one million dollars. The competition has 48 players in each of the categories, male and female, including the ranking number one, Chinese Lin Shidong, and world champion, also Chinese Sun Yingsha.</description><pubDate>2025-04-17 00:53:34</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Touring cars finding begins with greater presence Macaense</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/04/16/gp-apuramento-dos-carros-de-turismo-comeca-com-maior-presenca-macaense/</link><description>The Macao-Macao Road Sport Challenge Touring Car Championship will start this weekend at the Guangdong International Circuit in the city of Zhaoqing, 200 kilometers northwest of the ride. For this race, which will serve as qualification for the 72nd Macao Grand Prix, will be on the starting grid a dozen Macau pilots, including five Portuguese names
 
Among the sixty subscribers, all equipped with two types of vehicles - Toyota GR86 (ZN8) or Subaru BRZ (ZD8) - are well -known guys from Macau's motor racing. With the same enthusiasm recognized for decades, Rui Valente will again drive a Subaru BRZ, the same car with which he competed in the Guide Circuit in November last year. Premium Racing Team driver had, in the last Macao Grand Prix, one of the fastest in terms of tip speed in the platoon of his race. Therefore, the focus on pre-season has been in other technical aspects of the car that go beyond the engine.
Also back is Célio Alves Dias, after a difficult year in 2024, far short of his expectations. For this, the pilot Macaense bet on changing the chassis of his Toyota Gr86. This year, its objective is to account for the twenty -fifth participation in the largest annual sports event of MSAR, so all the details are important.
Back is also Jerónimo Badaraco (Toyota Gr86), a pilot who, in the Macao Grand Prix last year, reached second place at Macao Road Sport Challenge. After having been modest in the finding events, “Noni” was very strong in the city streets, where he was the best Macaense pilot, in a race won by law Kit Meng.
In debut this year will be Maximian Mannão. Bringing with him a nickname with a huge tradition in Macao's motorsport, the young Maximiano, who competed for several years in the local Karting events and, in 2022, participated in a Formula 4 Chinese Championship race, will make his debut at Macau Road Sport Challenge with a Toyota GR86.
The Macanese presence will be reinforced by Dionísio Albino Pereira, a pilot regularly seen in the coloane Karting events, which will conduct a Toyota GR86 from LW World Racing Team. In 2013, he competed in the Macao - Macau Touring Car Series Tourism Championship, then driving a Honda Integra DC5 from the Pas Macau Racing Team team.
The representation of the territory in these findings will also feature Chi Wang, Carson Tang, IP Tok Meng, Chan Chi Ha, Lo Kai Tin and Lou Check In.
It will be to hurt
In 2024, the Macao-China General Automotive Association (AAMC) was able to place all the drivers of the Macau Tourism Championship in the end of the Grand Prix. This year, it seems that the scenario of organizing two races for local pilots will be impossible. As such, these qualifying races will have a much higher impact, and only half of those now registered will have entry ticket for the largest annual sports event of MSAR.
Another novelty for this year is that all cars will be equipped with tires of the Italian brand Pirelli, as had already happened in the Grand Prix. However, this year there will be a new compound, the same for everyone, which may shuffle the favorite accounts. Centralins will continue to be drawn, as in the past.
Since the number of participants is high, AAMC will divide the pilots into groups A and B, not two but four races in total. Each race will have 15 laps, two of which will be played on Saturday and two on Sunday.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>FIRST RALENT PROOF FOR THE MACAU GP took place in Shanghai</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/25/primeira-prova-de-apuramento-para-o-gp-macau-decorreu-em-xangai/</link><description>The first determination test for the 72nd edition of the Macau Grand Prix took place last weekend at the International Shanghai Circuit.

The GT Cup-Great Bay Race joined the newly created SRO GT Cup, the latest GT competition launched in the interior of China, inspired by the GT4 class vehicles of the Macao Grand Prix. Thirty-three cars, six of them driven by Macau pilots, signed up for this debut-a record number of participants in a GT4 category in Asia category.
According to the organizer's statement, Sro Motorsports Group, “the total number of cars and the variety of builders have even exceeded the organizers' expectations for a championship that only began to be discussed in late November 2024. Since then, the Sro Asia team and their partner AAMC (Macau-China General Automobile Association) have worked tirelessly to make the series a reality before their debut.”
The event started in a troubled way. Due to a customs problem that affected several cars, more than a dozen competitors was unable to participate in the free training session on Friday. Fortunately, for this group of pilots, among which were included the pilots of the Kevin Leong Ian Veng, Kim Hou Lao and Un HA IP, the cars arrived at the circuit in time for Saturday's qualification.
Animated races and decision in Zhuhai
With three dozen cars, from ten different brands, on track, all with very balanced tasks, was attended by two animated races in the imposing Shanghai track. In the first 12 -lap race, the two Lotus Emi GT4 Officials, by Daniel Lu and Luo Kailuo, who departed from the first line of the grill, were overcome on track by the Chen Weian Audi R8 LMS GT4. In the second match of the weekend, Lichao Han, behind the wheel of the same Toyota GR GT4 who beat the GT Cup - Great Bay Race in 2024, triumphed ahead of Chen Weian and Lotus de Liu Kai Shun.
Macao pilots had no easy life on a track where they had little or no experience. The most rewarded of all, Kelvin Leong, abandoned in the second round of the first race, while Miguel Law, in Audi R8 LMS GT4, was the best of the riders of MSAR, ending in 19th place. In Sunday's race, Leong took his BMW M4 GT4 F82 to 11th place.
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, at the end of the season, on the streets of Macau. The places will be attributed based on the classification after the second round of the championship, scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit, in a date yet to be announced.</description><pubDate>2025-03-25 01:20:30</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | Fia introduces costly measure to GT world cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/21/gp-macau-fia-introduz-medida-onerosa-para-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>The International Automobile Federation (FIA) announced on Tuesday afternoon a technical measure for the GT3 cars participating in the GT World Cup of the Macao Grand Prix, which will certainly have an impact on a race that is the event's headlord
 
To improve the Balance of Performance (BOP) - the method that balances the progress between all cars in the GT3 category - the FIA ​​decided to force the use of torque sensors, like what you already do in their championships, such as resistance worlds (WEC) and Rally Raid or Formula E. Torque sensors offer a very high precision in power measurement, allowing FIA ensures that the power of each car does not exceed the values ​​assigned by BOP and that external factors, such as atmospheric conditions, do not influence performance.
Although Sro Motorsports Group is co-organizer of this race, and having a bop recognized worldwide, in the last two years, the Macao Bop has been provided by the FIA ​​itself. Last year, the FIA ​​BOP was worth a series of criticisms, with teams and pilots-particularly from Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, the main impaired-to publicly express their natural discontent with the difference in progress.
These sensors are installed in car transmission veins and represent the most effective tool for measuring wheel power, being individually attributed by the BOP process to each car model that participates in the world's most prestigious “sprint” race for GT3 class machines. According to FIA, the decision to make torque sensors mandatory after consultations with the brands involved in the GT3 technical working group.
Costs will shoot
For a race that has several private teams, this measure will be expensive, as these sensors exceed half a million patacas per car, and the teams need to have another same spare reserve system. This, given that most teams that participate in the MSar test do not use torque sensors in their cars in any competition, and cannot amortize the brutal investment.
"From the experience I had in Qatar, it is noted that there is a difference between several builders in the way it generates this technology. An extra support team is needed to monitor and maximize performance without exceeding the stipulated limits," he told HM Duarte Alves, the experienced track engineer in the territory who was with the official Ford team in the first WEC season in the Arab country.
"A good example is the difficulty and time needed for a builder who enters as a newcomer. An illustrative case is Mercedes-AMG, which is facing growth pains while developing its own systems," said Duarte Alves. “In more flat circuits, the management of these systems is simpler. In places like Macau, where 'torque peaks' will always be frequent, it will be a real challenge for the engineers of these systems!”
Confident
Immune to all this, the FIA ​​chooses a speech directed to builders, forgetting that most of the starting grid is made up of private competitors.
Lutz Leif Linden, chairman of the FIA ​​GT commission, said the institution that represents “made this decision in consultation with the builders”, adding that, to the International Federation, “this means even more justice and improved control of BOP values, which is particularly important in such a prestigious and media event, in such a demanding circuit, where long -speed long -speed straight lines and narrow ”.
Fabrice Van Ertvede, FIA speed technical manager, stressed the idea that "our goal, as a regulatory entity, is to ensure total equity for all participants." The implementation of torque sensors “is an extremely effective tool for achieving this goal, allowing us to align very different cars in parameters such as pure power, but also at full speed, a crucial factor in a circuit like the guide circuit.”
Despite the difficulties that Mercedes-AMG encountered with this system last month, Fabrice Van Ertvede praises that “the builders we hope to see in Macau this year are already familiar with this innovation, through their experience in the FIA's LMGT3 LMGT3 class, and the decision to adopt torque sensors resulted from the dialogue we kept with them.”
This is the second news that the FIA ​​introduces in the mashed race, having announced last month that the second qualification segment will have a super pole format, with each pilot to go to the track individually for a total of two qualification laps. The eighth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup will take place from November 13 to 16, as part of the 72nd edition of the Macao Grand Prix.</description><pubDate>2025-03-21 17:11:10</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
