Asked at a press conference about Trump's statements, which accused Zelensky of risking World War II and not ready for peace, the country's Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lin Jian, has just stressed that "China will continue to play a constructive role in the search for a political solution to the Ukraine crisis."
When asked again about the meeting in Washington, the spokesman reiterated the same answer and added that China "is neither the creator of the crisis in Ukraine nor part involved in the conflict."
Beijing supports "all efforts aimed at a peaceful resolution" and hopes that conflict parties will find "a sustainable and lasting solution that responds to their concerns," he said.
Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, China has maintained an ambiguous position on conflict, appealing to respect for the “territorial integrity of all countries,” including Ukraine, and attention for the “legitimate concerns of all countries” in a reference to Russia.
Beijing was opposed to unilateral sanctions against Moscow and appealed to "decancing and a political solution." However, the West accused China of supporting Russia's military campaign, something the Asian country has always denied.
China has sent diplomatic representatives to the region and presented peace initiatives, such as the plan it elaborated with Brazil last year, which did not include the removal of Russian troops and was rejected by Kiev.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 02:11:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Drainage | Ron Lam calls for unification of the legislation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/drenagens-ron-lam-pede-unificacao-da-legislacao/</link><description>Deputy Ron Lam defended the unification of the legislation on water drainage in the territory, according to the newspaper or Mun.

“We have a lot of healthy foods, but we still don't know how to use them correctly. Therefore, from now on, it is essential to develop a more productive thinking, ”he said.
According to Marcelino Freitas, the Timorese have to eat more sweet potatoes, cassava, and yams and other traditional foods and also learn to innovate and turn the way food cooks. The trainer also stressed that local products are rich in quality proteins, essential for healthy eating.
"The challenge now is to turn these foods to be healthier and can respond to individual and community needs," he said, appealing to the appreciation of local products so that people can have a better physical condition and more balanced health.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 02:01:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Lake Building | Investigation for security devices</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/edificio-do-lago-pedida-investigacao-a-dispositivos-de-seguranca/</link><description>Faced with the complaints of residents that the fire alarm did not touch, the deputy linked to the community of Jiangmen calls for an investigation to the security of social housing, as well as an intensification of inspections in all macau buildings
 
Representative Lo Choi in appealed to the government to conduct an investigation to the state of fire safety equipment in the lake building, after last week's fire that forced the withdrawal of 20 people. The subject is addressed through written interpellation, in which the Jiangmen community legislator stresses that residents did not hear the alarms and fire.
Information on problems with fire equipment had been reported on the day of the flames outbreak, but was also confirmed by the deputy's office. “Our service sent staff to the place to understand the situation. Residents of the same building, as well as those in the neighborhood, told us that they did not hear any suspicious alarm sound during the fire, ”he said. "From this incident, it is possible to find that the building company management may have disabilities in the management of its firefighting equipment, having even failed to provide timely information and correct guidelines to firefighters during the incident," he added.
In the face of this scenario, Lo Choi In asks for the intervention of the authorities: "Has the government already intended the way the management is done in the building where the fire took place?" He asked. “Regarding problems with security equipment at the fire site, does the government intend to launch an investigation to the succeeded, to investigate management deficiencies?” He asked.
Deeper problems
Lo Choi In also highlighted that the problems of safety equipment in the buildings of Macau are not uncommon and recalled the case in Areia Preta in 2019, with the Jardim Kong Fok Cheong building. "It was known that, at that time, the management of the building was extremely disabled, because the gates of the fuzz of many floors were seriously damaged, the extinguishers had expired 10 years ago, the lighting of emergency exits did not work correctly and the stairs of the floors were full of various objects," said the deputy. "Worse yet, when the fire broke out, not only the building's fire alarm system did not sound, but also the fires water supply system failed, it was difficult to put out the fire for a while in the absence of water supply, but fortunately, the neighbors called each other at that time," he added.
Given these recurring problems, the deputy wants to know if the government will intensify the supervision of different buildings and oblige the condominiums to meet security requirements.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 01:46:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Economic Housing | Put up with 3,000 apartments</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/habitacao-economica-arranca-escolha-de-3-000-apartamentos/</link><description>The first group of families selected to buy an economic housing apartment from the 2019 contest begins today to choose the fractions.

In turn, businessman Frederico MA defends the diversification of hengqin, which he considers very dependent on the Chimelong Park
 
Macao member at the National Committee of the Chinese Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC) Lee Chong Cheng advocates the circulation of Macao's public buses on Mountain Island to make life easier for residents. The desire was expressed in statements to the newspaper or Mun, before Lee Chong Cheng travels to Beijing, where you will participate in the "two meetings."
From the perspective of the president of the Macao Workers' Associations Federation, if buses can circulate between Macau and Hengqin, the will of residents of moving to the other side of the border will increase "significantly."
Currently, to move to Mountain Island, residents need to take transport from Macau to the border. Once on the other side of the border, they can resort to taxis or the public transport network of Hengqin. Lee wants Macau's buses to come directly on Mountain Island without changing transportation.
To promote hengqin circulation, Lee Chong Cheng also expects central authorities to make changes to the circulation of private cars on the border.
Lee suggests more flexibility of border passage procedures, so that special needs passengers are not required to get out of vehicles. Currently, people over 70 years old, or less than 10, pregnant and disabled, may remain inside the car during border inspection. According to the Faom leader, the conditions should be more flexible to cover people 60 or older, young people up to 15 years old, and for those seeking medical care.
As for the current measure of circulation of Macao vehicles in Guangdong Province, Lee Chong Cheng expects central government authorities to establish a specific corridor on the border only for Macao cars during weekends and holidays. Currently, the corridor is shared with Hong Kong vehicles.
Industrial expansion
In turn, Frederico Ma, also a member of Macau at CCPPC, considers that Macau and Hengqin should take advantage of the synergies to promote the entry of more mashed industries in the cooperation zone.
In addition, the official who also chairs the Macau Commercial Association recalled that the development of hengqin tourism must be diversified, as all tourist attractions are currently passing through the Chimelong theme park and hotel.
Frederico MA argues that Hengqin cannot depend on a single project, and advocates greater industrial development of hengqin, to take advantage of local advantages and diversify the economy. As an option for diversification, Frederico MA defends the bet on hengqin acupuncture, considering that it is an increasingly adopted practice by athletes in international sports competitions.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 00:57:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing | “Two sessions” start today focusing on the economy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/pequim-duas-sessoes-arrancam-hoje-com-foco-na-economia/</link><description>The month of March is synonymous with political movements in Beijing, with the political advisory conference of the Chinese people, which begins today, and the session of the National Popular Assembly, which begins tomorrow. At meetings will be discussed goals and political and economic plans for this year, without forgetting the evolution of the International Panorama
 
Today begins another session of the Chinese Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC), in Beijing, while for tomorrow is scheduled the start of the National Assembly (APN). The two events are the most important of the Chinese political system, materializing the country's political representativeness system, with the participation of delegations all provinces and regions of China, including the special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong. CCPPC has, as the name implies, an advisory character, while APN is the most important legislative body in the country.
The so -called “two sessions”, with annual periodicity, draw the attention from around the world because it is at this time that the Chinese government presents its economic goals and main political measures for the rest of the year.
According to the Xinhua state agency, data related to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the most attention points attracts, but the "two sessions" will also serve to shed some lights on China's foreign policy, something particularly remarkable in a turbulent global scenario.
Until March 11, the expected date for the closure of the work, there are objectives, calendars and essential policies, shaping “the political direction of the country” in a “complex and challenging global environment”, reads in Xinhua.
Let us look, then, to what we can expect in matters of GDP values. “As the Chinese economy is oriented for high quality development, GDP is not the only measure of the economy, but it remains an important indicator. In 2024, China reached its objective of economic growth of about five percent, thanks largely to a number of significant macroeconomic measures, introduced to compensate for the pressure of economic recession, ”he reads.
Thus, "more concrete policies to stimulate economic activity are expected." According to Xinhua, "China has already given signs of change in its macroeconomic orientation." "At the last central conference of economic labor in December, political officials committed to apply more proactive macroeconomic policies in 2025."
Thus, the adoption of a “monetary policy‘ moderately flexible ’was decided, which represents a significant removal from the 'prudent' approach adopted in the last 14 years,” the agency describes. In this meeting were also defined “nine fundamental priorities”, the first “the increase of consumption”.
Thus, it is expected that in the “two sessions”, “China emphasizes internal demand as the main economic priority”, and this year it is expected “that large-scale equipment updates and consumer exchange programs will be promoted with greater intensity and more extended”.
It is indicated that "China will actively use the maneuver margin for a higher deficit and increase the issuance of special obligations of local administrations", as well as "continuing to issue Special Treasury obligations with a longer term and increase central government transfer payments to local administrations." The "two sessions" will reveal more details in this regard.
Featured
Still on the economic level, Xinhua describes how President XI Jinping underlines on other occasions “the main priorities, such as support for the growth of the private sector”, “the acceleration of the development of the digital economy” and the deepening of the country's opening.
APN members “will analyze the annual budget and government development plan”, and proposals and suggestions related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) ”are also expected to be expected. In fact, this is “one of the main points of interest to China observers”, along with GDP values. It should be noted that, in this field, the country has sought to score points and gain a growing positioning in the market with the creation of the Deepseek platform.
According to the Global Times newspaper, Chinese companies such as Tencent, Baidu and Byd are part of DeepSeek in the products and services they make available, and "some local governments have also announced collaborations with Deepseek IA models to improve public services."
“Many AI-related plans mentioned in work reports of provincial governments [from China] focus on building innovation platforms, promoting industry deeper integration and improving political staff. It is important to note that the rise of platforms such as DeepSeek reflects China's commitment to make leadership in technological advances and a greater strategic focus on talent cultivation and the existence of an innovation conducive environment, ”he reads.
The “two sessions” also constitute “a crucial platform for political legislators and counselors to present suggestions and promote ample consensus on national development” in the AI ​​area, and “some of them are executives of renowned companies and researchers”.
GDP: Maintenance
Still with regard to Chinese GDP, an analysis by Neil Thomas and Jing Qiang of the Asia Society Policy Institute argues that the “two sessions” should reveal “an even more agenda for growth than last year, with approximate objectives of five percent for GDP growth, four percent for the GDP tax deficit and two percent inflation in terms of consumption ”. "Measures should also be introduced to increase consumption and encourage the private sector in innovation," the authors write.
The same analysis of the Asia Society Policy Institute also highlights economic measures to prevent and combat unemployment, a problem that has affected the Chinese economy in recent times.
“China will also announce the annual goals for new jobs in urban areas and the urban unemployment rate. Last year, Beijing settled these objectives in 12 million new jobs and 5.5 percent unemployment rate, and this year's numbers will probably be similar, ”is mentioned.
With regard to domestic consumption, China is intended to be more and more “a hub for product launch, winter tourism and has a 'silver savings' focusing on the area of ​​restoration for an elderly population”. Also according to the analysis of the Asia Society Polycy Institute, "other priorities include rebalancing economic platform regulations, stimulating economic activity in small towns, greater integration into the area of ​​the large bay and expanding investment in maritime industries."
Attention to Investment
The "two sessions" take place with Donald Trump to return to the presidency of the United States of America and certainly that this point will mark the external agenda of the meetings in Beijing throughout the week.
But still regarding the economy, the Chinese authorities will seek to present and discuss measures that may maintain foreign investment attraction in the country, after the launch of the “Action Plan to stabilize foreign investment”, on February 19.
Here is a “strategic change in Beijing's approach, moving away from tax benefits and subsidies and addressing the liberalization of specific sectors, rationalizing regulation and incentives for re-inbackets,” the same analysts point out.
Therefore, Beijing intends to “frame foreign companies into China's regulatory framework to turn them into long -term stakeholders, making local expansion more attractive than capital reafect to other markets”. Analysts also expect the "two sessions" to reveal concrete policies in this regard.
Sam Hou Fai in Beijing
The chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, has been in Beijing since yesterday to attend the opening ceremony of the third session of the 14th National Popular Assembly (APN), which takes place tomorrow.
Sam Hou Fai will be in the Chinese capital until Thursday of this week. According to a statement from the Social Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai will be replaced by the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, who acts interimly, the functions of Chief Executive.
In the 14th APN, the Government's work report will be reviewed and the analysis of the report on the implementation of the Annual National Economic and Social Development Plan for 2024. The agenda also includes analysis to the National Economic and Social Development Project for this year. The report on the implementation of the central and local budgets for 2024 will also be analyzed, as well as the central and local budget projects for 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 00:50:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Ukraine | Beijing avoids commenting on the Trump-Zelensky meeting</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/ucrania-pequim-evita-comentar-a-reuniao-trump-zelensky/</link><description>China yesterday reaffirmed its position on the war in Ukraine and avoided commenting on the tense meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian homologist Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House last Friday.

According to Marcelino Freitas, the Timorese have to eat more sweet potatoes, cassava, and yams and other traditional foods and also learn to innovate and turn the way food cooks. The trainer also stressed that local products are rich in quality proteins, essential for healthy eating.
"The challenge now is to turn these foods to be healthier and can respond to individual and community needs," he said, appealing to the appreciation of local products so that people can have a better physical condition and more balanced health.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 02:01:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinemateca Passion | Oscars and South Korea on this month's screen</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/cinemateca-paixao-oscares-e-coreia-do-sul-na-tela-deste-mes/</link><description>“Emilia Pérez”, a film with great presence in the Oscars, and “Mickey 17”, the latest of South Korean director Bong Joon Ho, author of “Parasites”, are some of the great highlights that Cinemateca Passion brings to the cinema rooms for this month

"We will take all the necessary measures to protect our legitimate interests," he added. The spokesman accused Washington of "politicizing economic and commercial issues" and said that "in a trade war there are no winners."

The estimates are included in a report from Seport Research Partners, quoted by the GGR Asia portal.
"We foresee that the growth of gross game revenues in 2025 is approximately 6.5 percent in annual terms, with higher growth in the second half of the year," the report signed by Vitaly Umnsky. "Growth should be driven by increasing operators' marketing efforts and improving consumer confidence in China," he was added.
The document appears days after it was revealed that the game's gross gross revenues grew 6.8 percent in February to 19.74 billion patacas.
With the magnificent meetings to begin today, in Beijing, the analyst also admits to hope that policies of greater support to economic growth will be announced: "We hope that the policies resulting from the two sessions will highlight a position more favorable to growth than the last two years," he said.
Vitaly Umansky also explained that the expectation is not the adoption of consumer subsidies inside, but rather by “additional stimuli” related to government expenses and policies to increase consumer expenses and private business activity.
Positive month
According to the same portal, the 6.8 percent growth of the game's recipes in February was also considered positive by JP Morgan Securities analysts, DS Kim, Selina Li and Mufan Shi. “Despite market concerns about poor Lunar New Year's performance, the game's gross recipes were strong in February and 7 percent increased to 19.7 billion, 6 percent above consensus,” was highlighted in a report to investors issued on Sunday.
However, for this investment bank growth throughout the year will be more moderate: "This number makes us feel quite comfortable about consensus on the growth of 2 to 3 percent of the game's recipes over 2025," they stressed.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 01:47:08</pubDate></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Zhu Yuanzhang (1328-1398), when he had not yet become Emperor Hongwu (1368-98), founder of the Ming Dynasty and was only a rebel that did not belong to the nobility, came down a large river when a rijo wind broke the mast of the ship carrying him.
Looking at the bank, he noticed in a large tree that rose from a temple and soon wished to use it to replace the broken mast. As he approached, however, the abbot of the monastery advised him that, before he did, he consulted the spirit of the temple by removing a tray of guessing. As he removed it, he read: "Everything under heaven has a master,/ an honorable man takes nothing to himself. Soon gave up on the intention.
The story illustrates the character of the future monarch that, being an orphan still very young, was welcomed in a Buddhist monastery as a novice monk, realizing the value of chance that since then has worked to peer. In choosing his counselors, obeying this concern, they were committed to planning the next steps.
Among them was Liu Ji (1311-1375) also known as Liu Bowen, the 'Sincere Old' Military Stratega, statesman and poet, to whom works that responded to this desire to predict the succession of the days, such as the book of prophecy Shaobing Gene Quan Wen, 'The Full Song of the Shabing Ball,' the 'Master Yulizi Treaty' From the brilliant trigram Li, the Fire », to clarify the world and the decision makers.

As on a trip he made, in the fall of 1343, with a companion for the Huangshan mountain range, the yellow mountain.
Leng Qian (c.1310-c.1371), this friend who was also scholarly in the arts and musical instruments, accompanied him in a way to an elevation, which from the time of Emperor Jiajing (r.1521-67) was designated Qiyun, 'tall as the clouds', being part of the way by sea, packed in the rhythm of the waves. This rhythm that Leng Qian, versed in the secrets of alchemy, sought to convey in the Painting Monte Baiyue (vertical roll, ink on paper, 84.4 x 41.4 cm, at the National Palace Museum in Taipei) who made Liu Ji's request to memorize the journey.
From the bank of the Hengjiang River, he made a painting free of options for styles or schools, taking advantage of chance, as Emperor Hongwu wanted.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>ANA CRISTINA ALVES</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/ana-cristina-alves/</link><description>Ana Cristina Alves - Coordinator of the CCCM Educational Service
Zhuangzi, the Taoist philosopher, who will have lived between the fourth and 3rd century BC, possibly between 369 and 268 BC, left us in the homonymous work 《莊 (庄) 子》, as was customary at the time, the possibly transmitted teachings in the first person in the interior chapters (1-7), in the second person in the external chapters (8-21) and in the third person of other intellectuals in the chapters of miscellany (22-33).
It is an extremely motivating philosophy that rests, from my point of view, in three fundamental principles: the acceptance of spontaneous nature (道 giving); The Principle of Transformation (物化 Wùhuà), which leads to the postulate of an essential uniformity; and the non-acting (無為/无为 wuwéi), which presupposes the acceptance of a pre-established harmony and destination. We are facing the best order possible, so it is not right to interfere with what is given to us, letting us lead by a necessarily tension rhythm of life, but whose challenges should be viewed without negative reactions, following the existential bamboo model, when confronted with gigantic winds, such as those of tuffons in China.
Chapters 17 and 18, which now bring themselves allegedly belong to their closest disciples, who faithfully transmit the philosophy of the great Taoist master, and Taoism is the most devoted philosophy to develop a personal project, which will therefore exemplary from the existential point of view.
Completing Chapter XVII, that of the Full Full (Qiū Shuǐ Dìshiqī), is assisted at a symbolic dialogue between the philosopher Zhuangzi and his great friend Huizi (惠子), known in the synological tradition, of which Father Thomas Merton is a good herald in The Via de Zhuangzi (1999, 126-127) Joy of fish ”, whose guideline principle is that of communicating connectivity among all living beings, the same that guides another episode, reported at the end of Chapter II, that of the philosopher dreams of being a butterfly (Zhuangzi, 1999,38-40).
In Chapter XVII, Zhuangzi affects the unbelieving friend Huizi to realize, or rather perfectly intuit the joy of fish, since when looking at them on the Hao River bridge recognizes the signs that in themselves manifest when they feel happy. Friend Huizi, following a rationalizing and separatist philosophy, opposes that this is impossible, being silenced by the logical assumption of communication between all nature. Zhuangzi appeals to the argument that it is possible to extend the intelligent dialogue of humans to all living beings. The philosopher, winning the debate, widened the mastery of language, which now includes the verbal, but also the visual, much closer to silent and intuitive communication, highly valued by the Taoist school, always suspicious of excessive and discursive profanity. And at the same time, guarantees the primacy of the connection, sometimes visible, sometimes invisible, among all nature, rooted in Tao, after all this viable connection of a flow of feelings among all beings, which leads to true joy, against the sad and solipsist cosmos defended in some rationalist philosophical traditions, whose primacy is based on a reason to establish the connection with the body, whether individual, whether individual Collective, as António Damásio had the opportunity to denounce in the error of Descartes (2011).
In fact, what matters so that joy is guaranteed, including humans, goes through a widening of the sphere of sensitivity, the feeling of oneself, still thinking of Damásio, the feeling of others, the recognition of the satisfaction coming from the profound connection between all nature.
Then move on to the translation of dialogue, the traditional Chinese to the contemporary and the contemporary to Portuguese:
原文 Classic Chinese1
莊子與惠子遊於濠梁之上。莊子曰： “鯈魚 2 出遊從容 ， 是魚之樂也。”
惠子曰： “子非魚 ， 安知魚之樂？”
莊子曰： “子非我 ， 安知我不知魚之樂？”
惠子曰： “我非子 ， 固不知子矣；子固非魚也 ， 子之不知魚之樂 ， 全矣。”
莊子曰： “請循其本。子曰‘ 汝安知魚樂 ’雲者 ， 既已知吾知之而問我 ， 我知之濠上也。”
今译 Contemporary Chinese
庄子和惠子在濠水桥上游玩。庄子说： “白鲦鱼从容不迫地游来游去 ， 这是鱼的快乐啊！”
惠子说： “您不是鱼 ， 怎么知道鱼是快乐的？”
庄子说： “您不是我 ， 怎么知道我不晓得鱼的快乐？”
惠子说： “我不是您 ， 固然不知道您；您本来也不知道鱼 ， 那么您不知道鱼的快乐 ， 是完全可以肯定的了。“
庄子说： “请回到原来的话题吧。您说‘ 您怎么知道鱼的快乐 ’这句话 ， 就是您已知道我晓得鱼的快乐而来问我的 ， —— 我是在濠水桥上知道的啊！”
(ZHUANGZI, 1999, 282-3)
Note that the translation I propose to Portuguese has some adaptation to our language, for example, I use conjunctions and conjunctive phrases to join prayers and avoid the repetition of certain verbs, with non-philosophical sense, in order to make reading more fluid:
Zhuangzi and Huizi were walking on the Hao River bridge, when Zhuangzi said, "The fish swim calmly and carelessly from side to side, this is your joy!"
Huizi replied, "If it's not fish, how can you know the joy of fish?"
Zhuangzi replied, "You're not me, how can you know that I don't know about the joy of fish?"
Huizi continued: “I am not my friend, which is why I do not know him, and the Lord does not know the fish either, so it is more than certain that they do not know their joy.”
Zhuangzi concluded: “Let's go back to the root of the question. He said the following prayer: 'How can you know the joy of the fish', so you already realized that I knew their joy, so I asked me about me, I met her on the Hao River bridge! ”
This spontaneous and natural connection to all that exists is a source of great joy and happiness, as explained to us in chapter XVIII, entitled “Perfect Happiness”. Here the principle of non-acting (無為/无为 wúwéi) is defended, rather, of agreement with nature, inner and exterior, without seeking to interfere with the world around us, because if the goal is to achieve happiness, it is not acquired by any of our actions that have in view of material or social values, as well as wealth, honors, abundance or even health; We arrived at this world without being consulted and will leave when it is our time, as well illustrated the episode of the death of Zhuangzi's wife, reported in this same chapter. When Huizi visits his friend to introduce him to his condolences, he finds him crouching to drum into a basin and singing, in a clear acceptance of fate: yes, the woman had made her very good company over decades, she had to accept the law of nature and not revolt against the pre-established order, which tells us there is health and illness, wealth and poverty, life and death in an eternal transformation cycle.  "Genuine happiness is derived from the absence of happiness, just as perfect fame derives from the absence of fame." (至樂無樂 ， 至譽無譽, in the contemporary version of simplified Chinese, 最大的快乐在于 ‘无乐 '最高的荣誉在于‘ 无誉 ’(Zhuangzi, 1999, 286).
By non-acting, or rather, as we do not follow the existential models of the light/clairvoyant sky and the quiet earth, thus achieving perfect happiness and immense joy in living:
原文 Classic Chinese
天下是非果未可定也。雖然 ， 無為可以定是非。至樂活身 ， 惟無為幾存。請嘗試言之。天無為以之清 ， 地無為以之寧 ， 故兩無為相合 故兩無為相合 萬物皆化生。芒乎芴乎 無從出乎？芴乎芒乎 ， 而無有象乎！萬物職職 ， 皆從無為殖。故曰天地無為也而無不為也
今译 Contemporary Chinese
天下的是非确实还难以下定论。尽管如此 ， “无为” 可以定是非。最大的快乐能存活身心 ， 而只有清静无为才几乎可以存活身心。请让我说说试试看：天 “无为” ， 因而清虚; 地 “无为” ， 因而宁静 ， 天与地这两个无为的合一 ， 才孕育出万物的存在。恍恍惚惚 才孕育出万物的存在。恍恍惚惚 ， 不知道它们从哪里生出来！恍恍惚惚找不出一点迹象来！万物繁多 “天地无心作为 ， 却没有一样东西不是从它们之中产生出来的。”
(ZHUANGZI, 1999, 286)
Translation proposal for Portuguese
It is very difficult to distinguish right from wrong in our world, even though it “not acting” can do so, which is the greatest happiness. Allow me to say it, the sky is clairvoyant because of its "not acting"; The earth is quiet because of its "not acting." Not acting conjugates from heaven and earth leads to pregnancy and existence of all that lives indistinctly, without realizing where they came from! Indistinctly, without traces, the myriads of beings arise, all created from a vital non-report. That is why it is said that, "Heaven and Earth create unintentionally, but nothing is generated."
And it is added in conclusion that it does not interfere with the heaven of the earth with the natural order of the "ten thousand beings" brings great joy and even supreme happiness following what is defended by the founder of Taoism, in chapter VII of the book of the road and virtue 《道德经 • 七》 3, in the translation of António Graça de Abreu (2013):
天長地久
天地所以能長且久者
以其不自生
故能長生
(……)
Eternal, heaven and earth.
Why eternal?
Do not exist for themselves,
So they remain forever.

Asked at a press conference about Trump's statements, which accused Zelensky of risking World War II and not ready for peace, the country's Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lin Jian, has just stressed that "China will continue to play a constructive role in the search for a political solution to the Ukraine crisis."
When asked again about the meeting in Washington, the spokesman reiterated the same answer and added that China "is neither the creator of the crisis in Ukraine nor part involved in the conflict."
Beijing supports "all efforts aimed at a peaceful resolution" and hopes that conflict parties will find "a sustainable and lasting solution that responds to their concerns," he said.
Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, China has maintained an ambiguous position on conflict, appealing to respect for the “territorial integrity of all countries,” including Ukraine, and attention for the “legitimate concerns of all countries” in a reference to Russia.
Beijing was opposed to unilateral sanctions against Moscow and appealed to "decancing and a political solution." However, the West accused China of supporting Russia's military campaign, something the Asian country has always denied.
China has sent diplomatic representatives to the region and presented peace initiatives, such as the plan it elaborated with Brazil last year, which did not include the removal of Russian troops and was rejected by Kiev.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>PAULO MAIA AND CARMO</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/autor/paulomaiaecarmo/</link><description>Zhu Yuanzhang (1328-1398), when he had not yet become Emperor Hongwu (1368-98), founder of the Ming Dynasty and was only a rebel that did not belong to the nobility, came down a large river when a rijo wind broke the mast of the ship carrying him.

Two residents of Macao of Portuguese nationality reveal to HM which leads them to cross the border frequently, especially the weekend. Cultural diversity, low prices and higher quality of service in bars and restaurants make all the difference
 
Macao Small and Medium-sized (SME) have faced, since the reopening of borders in the postpandeia period, huge difficulties to recover the business, especially those that are further away from the tourist areas. At a time when traveling to China has become extremely easy and cheap, two residents explain why they prefer to move often to the neighboring city of Zhuhai, or even Shenzhen, and consume there instead of being in Macao. Options like dinner outside, catching a taxi or drinking a glass are much cheaper, and the possibility of driving outside the territory has made this option more frequent. But electronic trade has also contributed to the fall of local consumption, they ensure.
Nelson Moura, journalist and resident of Portuguese nationality, goes to Zhuhai whenever he has a free weekend or holidays. It even goes between three to four times a month. “Costs are lower inside China, and then there is the novelty factor. It has never been easy for a non -Chinese resident of Macau to go to China. I previously needed to ask for a visa, had a reduced deadline, and this greatly limited my trips, and always chose more distant places in a context of tourist travel. Local residents could go to China before, but the current convenience, with organized and developed borders, especially Hengqin, with the connection to the light meter, allows for easier connections, ”he told HM.
Since China has flexed the policy of visas and increased the offer of border circulation, traveling to the country is no longer seen as a great trip. “As a foreigner residing in Macao, going to China was a bit like going traveling to another Asian country. In the pandemic we did not go practically from Macau, but now since the policy of visas to Portuguese has been flexible, it is possible to go to China whenever we want, ”said Nelson Moura.
“I am as easily as a Chinese resident, and it has become a viable option to go to the weekends and holidays to China, knowing different sites. The food is a third of the price of what is practiced in Macau, has more quality, with fresh products, the reception offers are better. Macao is a great city, but after three years of pandemic knows very well to get out of here whenever we want. It is a more convenient option now than before. ”
Nelson Moura also considers that "for the Chinese community of Macao and Hong Kong there is a greater convenience of travel," as "there are many residents leading all weekends to China just to go to large commercial surfaces, which allows you to buy large amounts of food."
“Traffic near the border of the HKZM siege or bridge is at a level never seen before. There is the option of being able to drive in the large bay zone which is good for small and expensive cities like are Macau and Hong Kong, ”he said.
PME, the eternal problem
On the side of Macau, associations linked to the Chinese community's commercial sector call for help, asking for more measures such as the great consumption award, or even consumer cards, that is, more campaigns and initiatives so that residents can buy more in Macao with discounts or support.
One of the last voices showing concern about this scenario was Stanley Au, president of the Macao SME association. To TDM Canal Macau, the official argued that in the next lines of government action the Chief Executive, Sam Hou Fai, must show effective measures to avoid closing and, consequently, more unemployment. “The most urgent and current situation is the closure of companies. I believe the population saw many stores closed in different neighborhoods of the territory. Sometimes, on the same street, there are more stores closed than opened. In addition, the biggest problem is that Macau is facing continuous economic slowdown. If we do not solve this problem, society does not improve, ”he added.
However, according to Nelson Moura, it will always be difficult to combat the attraction of the consumption of Greater China. “Macao's local commerce is a complicated issue. There is a major reduction in consumers, especially on weekends and days when people have time to leave the city. ”
Electronic trade also enhances a reduction in local consumption. “Residents know they find more and cheaper out there. There are Chinese electronic trade companies such as TAOBAO, which allow purchases from all over China to Macau without transportation charges, which has reduced domestic consumption. People go to stores to see what they want to buy and then do it at Taobao. I don't know how this trend can be circumvented. It is capitalism to work, ”explained Nelson Moura.
The resident also draws attention to the fact that it is now easier to use online payment platforms in China with foreign cards or Macao banks, namely through MPay.
Nelson Moura believes that local SMEs have only endured so much time because they were in a kind of closed economic circuit. “Local businesses lived a little in an island economy, and they survived the fact that the Macao market is in the territory, without people could leave so much. Now that there has been competition with what China has to offer, companies suffer because they often don't offer the service so much quality and at such an attractive price. I know the situation in Hong Kong is similar. ”
“Like” in China
Macaense Miguel Rosa Duque has always worked in Macau and spent in the territory most of the days of the week, but since he started teaching in Zhuhai his life has become more across the border. Highlights the much cheaper night exits as well as the restoration offer. “Macao has no variety and people are filled with the fact that the territory is small. We have hotels and restaurants, but they are expensive because the lace are expensive. Faced with China, in terms of price, the difference is like between heaven and earth. I give an example: To take a taxi from the siege gates to the university where I teach it is 40 minutes of travel, 28 kilometers, and paid about 60 to 80 Renminbis. It's very cheap. In Macao, from the doors of the siege to Coloane we pay 150 patacas or more, the price difference is huge. ”
Miguel Rosa Duque says that the trips to China in her circle of friends have become so frequent that they even created a group on the WhatsApp social network to facilitate group walks. “I prefer to go to China a thousand times just for fun. I have a lot of variety of bars and nightclubs and in Macau everything is dead. A two -person massage costs 600 Renminbis in Macao costs twice. I don't talk about hotel massage. Customer service is much better in China, with more attention to customers, more attentive, and it's all cheaper. If we spend 1000 patacas on a night in Macao, China we spend 400 Renminbis and we are treated like kings. The variety is infinite in terms of restaurants. Macau can't compete, ”he said.
Miguel Rosa Duque says that he has friends who, even with a car in Macau, eventually acquired another Chinese enrollment car who are parked in the border parking park because it is cheaper to rent a place to park.
Macanese understands that between local SMEs and trade in China “there is no possible competition”, especially with online sales platforms. “People no longer go to stores here, there are a thousand choices and you can buy it from home. My girlfriend rarely goes to the supermarket, does everything online, for example, ”he added.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Teaching | Chinese universities rise in ranking by disciplines</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/25/ensino-universidades-chinesas-sobem-em-ranking-por-disciplinas/</link><description>Chinese universities have risen at the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025” in various areas, although in arts and humanities Asia remains short of other continents. In 11 disciplines analyzed, such as Law, Management and Economics, China and Singapore are in the 50 best, while Hong Kong stands out in Education Studies
 
The latest world ranking of Higher Education areas of Times Higher Education, the “World University Rankings by Subject 2025”, concludes that universities in the interior of China have risen for top positions, although Asia continues to position themselves in the areas of arts and humanities.
In total, 11 academic areas were analyzed. “Arts and Humanities”, “Business and Economics”, “Computer Science”, “Education Studies”, “Engineering”, “Law”, “Life Sciences”, “Medicine and Health”, “Physical Sciences”, “Psychology” and “Social Sciences”.
It is concluded, according to an official note from Times Higher Education (The), that “China and Singapore appear among the 50 best in all 11 subjects”, especially the University of Beijing and Tsinghua University, respectively, for fourth and sex places in “business and economy” disciplines. In fact, “Asia's best performance is registered in the areas of management and economics”, with “its main universities to continue to have difficulty competing worldwide in the field of arts and humanities”. "Concerns about the 'crisis' in humanities seem to be designed to continue this year, but the analysis of The reveals the continuous importance to elite institutions."
Given the analysis of 11 academic areas, the neighboring region of Hong Kong stands out in nine, especially in the area of ​​education, where the University of Beijing and Tsinghua also achieved good results. “The National University of Singapore again occupies the ninth position in Engineering, entering the top 10 of the physical sciences-the first institution in Asia to achieve it-in 10th place,” is also read.
Quoted by the same grade, Simon Marginson, professor at Oxford University, an institution that usually leads rankings worldwide, said that Asia's performance in this classification shows “the multipolar world of higher education” existing today, with greater amplification “national academic capacity”.
"In this context, over time, the relative position of Anglosfera countries and Western Europe must decrease, not because its absolute quality is decreasing, but because the field of comparison is more filled with other countries to emerge," he said.
The same responsible also pointed out that "East Asia and Southeast Asian higher education systems have improved over the past two decades due to the growth in the number of students, increased public funding, more performance -oriented organization and management and selective internationalization policies."
One of the areas where there is a better position of Asian universities is in education studies, showing “a remarkable force, with three universities in the top 10, with the University of Hong Kong in sixth place, the University of Tsinghua in seventh place and the university of Beijing in eighth place”. In addition, The Show that the Chinese University of Hong Kong has made “significant progress” from 19th to 11th position. On the other hand, the Taiwan National University of Science and Technology (Taiwan Tech) obtained "the highest score in terms of research quality."
However, global leadership goes to Stanford University, "surpassing the University of California, Berkeley, demonstrating exceptional performance in both teaching and research environment."
China rises in law
Looking at the area of ​​law, there is currently, according to the ranking of The, the best place to study than Stanford University, which has achieved “excellence in teaching and research environment”, followed by Harvard University, with “exceptional performance” and, thirdly, the University of New York, “with the highest score in terms of research environment”.
Highlight, in this area, for the entrance of the University of Beijing in 14th position, in part due to the good classification “in teaching and the research environment”. It should be noted that, as regards the law, 389 institutions from 48 countries and territories were classified, using 18 “strict performance indicators”.
In the area of ​​law, specialties are analyzed such as constitutional and administrative law and examination to structures and frameworks of governance, or international law, which includes global legal systems and treaties.
Capital Knowledge
China also stands out in business and economy, led by MASSHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (MIT). The University of Beijing rose to fourth place, accompanied by 20 other Chinese universities that improved their positions in the table. In this area were analyzed 990 institutions from 85 countries and territories, with the attention focusing on the quality of teaching and research in disciplines such as strategic leadership, international business and organizational development, as well as business finances or economic.
With regard to the social sciences, China actually comes below the list of the top 20, again with the University of Beijing in 16th and the University of Tsinghua in 20th. Here, the lead is up to MIT, passing Stanford University for the third to call Oxford, with "exceptional performance in teaching and research environment." The London School of Economics and Political Science remains an integral institution of the top 10, now occupying ninth place.
1,093 institutions from 100 countries and territories were analyzed in disciplines such as media communication and studies, politics and international studies, including development studies, sociology, geography and anthropology.
China also rose in the discipline of Computer Science with the University of Beijing to move from 16th to 12th place. In this area, leads the University of Oxford, reaching its highest score ever.
MIT leads in arts
The MIT has been at the head of Stanford University, assuming “first place in arts and humanities, as well as business, economy and social sciences”, even if it is first recognized “by specialization in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics”. According to the ranking, it is now “the best place to study arts - with high scores in each of the five pillars underlying the methodology, especially the quality of the investigation and the international perspective”.
In the 11 subjects of the ranking The, “Stanford ranked first in education, law and psychology studies, Harvard University was first in engineering and life sciences”.
The only local institution in the ranking of The Disciplines is the University of Macao (one), but in places far below top 10: in the area of ​​computational sciences, it is in the 126-150 best in the world, a similar position occupied in the area of ​​education and engineering. In the area of ​​law, for example, one is in the best group of 176-200, while in life sciences is among the 151-175 best.</description><pubDate>2025-02-25 04:59:01</pubDate></item><item><title>Study | Digital insomnia treatment can combat depression</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/estudo-tratamento-digital-de-insonia-pode-combater-depressao/</link><description>An unprecedented study developed by several universities, including the Chinese Hong Kong University and the University of Beijing, concluded that cognitive behavioral therapy through mobile phone applications can help combat young people by monitoring insomious. The rate of disease reduction is about 40 percent
 
The study “Effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Based on Insomnia in the prevention of Major Depressive Disturbance in Youth with Insomnia and Subclinical Depression: An Random Clinical Essay” Insomnia and Subclinical Depression: Randomized clinical trial] promises answers to the treatment of cases of depression in the younger ones.
The work, published by PLOS MEDICINE magazine and developed by academics from various universities in Hong Kong and China, including the University of Hong Kong, Chinese Hong Kong University or the University of Beijing, concludes that it is possible to reduce, by about 40 percent, cases of depression in young people with the use of a mobile phone application that monitors insoponies, a habitual symptoms, a symptom in the one who suffers from the sufferers illness. The data were presented at the end of last week in Hong Kong.
To reach the results, a random sample of more than 700 young Chinese from the interior of China and Hong Kong with insomnia disturbance and depressive symptoms, aged 15 to 25 years, who underwent testing with application for six weeks, was chosen.
Thus, “this controlled and random study evaluated the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for application based on application (TCC-I) in preventing the future appearance of Major Depressive Disturbance (MDD) in young people” can be read. This at a time when "more and more evidence suggests that insomnia plays an important role in the development of depression," in this investigation "intervention in insomnia as a promising approach to prevent depression in young people."
Thus, “application TCC-based is effective in preventing the future appearance of major depression and improving the results of insomnia among young people with insomnia and subclinical depression”. The study also concludes that "these results underline the importance of aiming at insomnia to prevent the appearance of DMG [a type of depression] and enhance the need for greater dissemination of digital TCC-I to promote sleep and mental health in the young population."
It is also concluded that the TCC-I based on applications "not only improved night insomnia symptoms, but also reduced daytime fatigue and led to greater change to maturity."
More than 700 young people analyzed
After testing the application of TCC-I, base clinical interviews were conducted over a period of six to 12 months to understand the results in participants and monitor symptoms. We spoke, in the period between September 9, 2019 and November 25, 2022, of 708 participants, of which 407 was women (57 percent), with an average ages of 22 years. The study also points out that “37 participants, 10 percent, in the intervention group and 62 participants, 18 percent, in the control group developed new mood disturbances over the 12 months of follow -up”.
In turn, the group that was subject to CBT-I based on mobile phone application, ie cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, presented “rates of remission of insomnia disturbance higher than post-intervention control groups” within one year. In addition, the same group "reported a greater decrease in depressive symptoms than post-intervention controls and over six months of follow-up." The authors of the study understand that "insomnia was a mediator of the effects of intervention on depression", and no adverse events related to interventions were reported. "
The authors left for this study with some proven ideas that insomnia is one of the main causes for depression. "Emerging data on insomnia intervention, especially cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (TCC-I), have shown promising results in insomnia relief and depressive symptoms in patients with insomnia," he reads.
Existing investigations focus on adults and elderly, so it was important to analyze this matter among the younger ones.
"In addition, there are few studies with suitable statistical power to demonstrate the preventive effect of TCC-I on depression, both at the level of symptoms and disturbances," explains the study authors, stressing that "little is known about whether the digital insomnia intervention can potentially prevent youthful depression."
Important meanings
The study also points out that cognitive behavioral therapy for applications based on insomnia is a viable and effective intervention to prevent future depression at both symptoms and disturbances in young people. ” However, further studies are recommended to explore “the integration of application-based TCC-I in clinical practice to improve accessibility and prevent depression among the young population”.
It is also mentioned the need for more clinical trials “to explore the potential benefits of adapting digital interventions on sleep in relief and prevention of depression” in order to “move towards personalized and staggered care approaches to the community”.
Limitations are referred to in this study published in “PLOS Medicine”, namely “the inclusion of a mixture of individuals with and without prior depression, and a limited sample of adolescents, although there was an adequate global sample”.
To the Hong Kong press, the study authors spoke of the importance of these results and how they can constitute new tools in future treatments of the disease. Quoted by The Standard HK, Chen Si-Jing, the first author of the Postdoctoral Research and Psychiatry Department of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the study "shows that Digital TCC-I is effective in preventing the future appearance of severe depression, with satisfactory effectiveness." Wing Yun-Kwok, director of the Li Chiu Kong family sleep evaluation unit, indicated that future studies will focus on digital intervention on insomnia in clinical practice.
The unprecedented character of this study in Asia still gives him greater importance. According to Lu Lin, an academic at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and president of the PKU Sixth Hospital, to date "no investigation in Asia had been carried out on the effectiveness of this therapy."</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:07:54</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing | “Two sessions” start today focusing on the economy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/pequim-duas-sessoes-arrancam-hoje-com-foco-na-economia/</link><description>The month of March is synonymous with political movements in Beijing, with the political advisory conference of the Chinese people, which begins today, and the session of the National Popular Assembly, which begins tomorrow. At meetings will be discussed goals and political and economic plans for this year, without forgetting the evolution of the International Panorama
 
Today begins another session of the Chinese Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC), in Beijing, while for tomorrow is scheduled the start of the National Assembly (APN). The two events are the most important of the Chinese political system, materializing the country's political representativeness system, with the participation of delegations all provinces and regions of China, including the special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong. CCPPC has, as the name implies, an advisory character, while APN is the most important legislative body in the country.
The so -called “two sessions”, with annual periodicity, draw the attention from around the world because it is at this time that the Chinese government presents its economic goals and main political measures for the rest of the year.
According to the Xinhua state agency, data related to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the most attention points attracts, but the "two sessions" will also serve to shed some lights on China's foreign policy, something particularly remarkable in a turbulent global scenario.
Until March 11, the expected date for the closure of the work, there are objectives, calendars and essential policies, shaping “the political direction of the country” in a “complex and challenging global environment”, reads in Xinhua.
Let us look, then, to what we can expect in matters of GDP values. “As the Chinese economy is oriented for high quality development, GDP is not the only measure of the economy, but it remains an important indicator. In 2024, China reached its objective of economic growth of about five percent, thanks largely to a number of significant macroeconomic measures, introduced to compensate for the pressure of economic recession, ”he reads.
Thus, "more concrete policies to stimulate economic activity are expected." According to Xinhua, "China has already given signs of change in its macroeconomic orientation." "At the last central conference of economic labor in December, political officials committed to apply more proactive macroeconomic policies in 2025."
Thus, the adoption of a “monetary policy‘ moderately flexible ’was decided, which represents a significant removal from the 'prudent' approach adopted in the last 14 years,” the agency describes. In this meeting were also defined “nine fundamental priorities”, the first “the increase of consumption”.
Thus, it is expected that in the “two sessions”, “China emphasizes internal demand as the main economic priority”, and this year it is expected “that large-scale equipment updates and consumer exchange programs will be promoted with greater intensity and more extended”.
It is indicated that "China will actively use the maneuver margin for a higher deficit and increase the issuance of special obligations of local administrations", as well as "continuing to issue Special Treasury obligations with a longer term and increase central government transfer payments to local administrations." The "two sessions" will reveal more details in this regard.
Featured
Still on the economic level, Xinhua describes how President XI Jinping underlines on other occasions “the main priorities, such as support for the growth of the private sector”, “the acceleration of the development of the digital economy” and the deepening of the country's opening.
APN members “will analyze the annual budget and government development plan”, and proposals and suggestions related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) ”are also expected to be expected. In fact, this is “one of the main points of interest to China observers”, along with GDP values. It should be noted that, in this field, the country has sought to score points and gain a growing positioning in the market with the creation of the Deepseek platform.
According to the Global Times newspaper, Chinese companies such as Tencent, Baidu and Byd are part of DeepSeek in the products and services they make available, and "some local governments have also announced collaborations with Deepseek IA models to improve public services."
“Many AI-related plans mentioned in work reports of provincial governments [from China] focus on building innovation platforms, promoting industry deeper integration and improving political staff. It is important to note that the rise of platforms such as DeepSeek reflects China's commitment to make leadership in technological advances and a greater strategic focus on talent cultivation and the existence of an innovation conducive environment, ”he reads.
The “two sessions” also constitute “a crucial platform for political legislators and counselors to present suggestions and promote ample consensus on national development” in the AI ​​area, and “some of them are executives of renowned companies and researchers”.
GDP: Maintenance
Still with regard to Chinese GDP, an analysis by Neil Thomas and Jing Qiang of the Asia Society Policy Institute argues that the “two sessions” should reveal “an even more agenda for growth than last year, with approximate objectives of five percent for GDP growth, four percent for the GDP tax deficit and two percent inflation in terms of consumption ”. "Measures should also be introduced to increase consumption and encourage the private sector in innovation," the authors write.
The same analysis of the Asia Society Policy Institute also highlights economic measures to prevent and combat unemployment, a problem that has affected the Chinese economy in recent times.
“China will also announce the annual goals for new jobs in urban areas and the urban unemployment rate. Last year, Beijing settled these objectives in 12 million new jobs and 5.5 percent unemployment rate, and this year's numbers will probably be similar, ”is mentioned.
With regard to domestic consumption, China is intended to be more and more “a hub for product launch, winter tourism and has a 'silver savings' focusing on the area of ​​restoration for an elderly population”. Also according to the analysis of the Asia Society Polycy Institute, "other priorities include rebalancing economic platform regulations, stimulating economic activity in small towns, greater integration into the area of ​​the large bay and expanding investment in maritime industries."
Attention to Investment
The "two sessions" take place with Donald Trump to return to the presidency of the United States of America and certainly that this point will mark the external agenda of the meetings in Beijing throughout the week.
But still regarding the economy, the Chinese authorities will seek to present and discuss measures that may maintain foreign investment attraction in the country, after the launch of the “Action Plan to stabilize foreign investment”, on February 19.
Here is a “strategic change in Beijing's approach, moving away from tax benefits and subsidies and addressing the liberalization of specific sectors, rationalizing regulation and incentives for re-inbackets,” the same analysts point out.
Therefore, Beijing intends to “frame foreign companies into China's regulatory framework to turn them into long -term stakeholders, making local expansion more attractive than capital reafect to other markets”. Analysts also expect the "two sessions" to reveal concrete policies in this regard.
Sam Hou Fai in Beijing
The chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, has been in Beijing since yesterday to attend the opening ceremony of the third session of the 14th National Popular Assembly (APN), which takes place tomorrow.
Sam Hou Fai will be in the Chinese capital until Thursday of this week. According to a statement from the Social Communication Office, Sam Hou Fai will be replaced by the Secretary for Administration and Justice, André Cheong, who acts interimly, the functions of Chief Executive.
In the 14th APN, the Government's work report will be reviewed and the analysis of the report on the implementation of the Annual National Economic and Social Development Plan for 2024. The agenda also includes analysis to the National Economic and Social Development Project for this year. The report on the implementation of the central and local budgets for 2024 will also be analyzed, as well as the central and local budget projects for 2025.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 00:50:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Diplomacy | Macao Platform seen in the context of Chinese foreign policy</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/19/diplomacia-plataforma-de-macau-vista-no-contexto-da-politica-externa-chinesa/</link><description>In "Paradiplomacy in China: Macao's role in relations between sino-Portuguese countries," Xu Heng Wang concludes that the role of platform with Lusophony "can be seen with extension of China's foreign policy." However, the MSar presents its own ideas, without “complete obedience to the central government”, indicates the academic
 
Macau's diplomatic role in the relationship with China and Portuguese -speaking countries was the focus of Xu Heng Wang's doctoral thesis defended in January at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Coimbra (UC). In “Paradiplomacy in China: The role of Macao in relations between the Sino-Portuguese-speaking countries”, the author argues that, regarding the role of Economic and Commercial Platform of MSA in Beijing's connection and Portuguese-speaking countries, there is a certain extent of Chinese foreign policy, but at the same time, ideas of local authorities.
"Although the role of Macao as an economic and commercial platform can be seen as an extension of China's foreign policy, this does not mean that Macau is in a state of complete obedience to the central government," is referred to in research work.
Although it is stressed that “it is difficult to discern Macao's desire to develop, it must be mentioned that Macau has his own ideas about the course of his development”, namely in relation to the game and the entire economic structure.
“Macao has long foresaw that the structure of his economy would be unbalanced and that the game would be dominant. Authorities and academics have also made many debates on the issue of unsustainable development based on the game industry. At the same time, Macau is also very aware of its advantages in terms of cultural integration, having carried out the construction of a historic and cultural city, becoming a tourist attraction. ”
Between the own ideas and what is defined in the field of foreign policy by Beijing, there is "a direction of the development of Macao which, basically, is consistent with the role that the central government has conceived to Macao."
In this context, the author concludes that “the interests of Macao and the Central Government are basically the same”, being “a special case of paradiplomacy in China”, due to the implementation of politics “a country, two systems” in the territory and the high degree of autonomy it provides in various areas.
THE ROLE OF THE MACAU FORUM
Xu Heng Wang took a different approach on this issue, not resorting to traditional international relations theories, because “Macao interactions involve both state and non-state actors,” so these theories “do not provide an accurate explanation of Macao's role”. Thus, and to understand the role of Macau in the relations between China and Portuguese -speaking countries, the idea of ​​paradiplomacy with Guanxi theory, a term used to describe social, economic or political relationships that can enhance business or other benefits, was combined.
Thus, it is said that "the creation of the Macau Forum can be considered one of the prominent paradiplomatic activities," with "Macao playing a role that mixes its development with the strategic objectives of the Chinese central government, especially with regard to Portuguese -speaking countries."
Macao has performed some relevant activities in the relations between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, ”although it is assumed that“ the results have been limited so far ”.
The academic states that these activities are "mainly concentrated in the fields of economics, education, tourism, culture and technology, with political effects that are not yet so evident." In addition, it is pointed out that "the influence of Macau on the relations between China and the different Portuguese -speaking countries has varied in intensity." Still, "much of the interaction and cooperation between Macao, China and the Portuguese -speaking countries occurred through the Macao Forum."
Help with objectives
In general terms, the “paradiplomacy of Macao is a complex and fluid process”, and the territory “shows its identity as a world tourism and leisure center and a characteristic financial center with international activities”, with the aim of “improving economic structure” and making diversification beyond game.
The author highlights fundamental areas such as services for small and medium enterprises, exchange-cultural and formation of bilingual talents. In addition, it is explained that “the central government provides political support to Macau based on its foreign policy needs, with the reinforcement of cooperation” with Portuguese -speaking countries. In these actions, include the Great Bay project, as well as the idea of ​​Macao's establishment as the Renminbi Compensation Center (RMB).
“On the one hand, the central government provides convenience to Macau and helps [the territory] to establish its identity," supported by the mainland China market. " On the other hand, it helps Macao develop the activity of RMB compensation center for transactions that occur on the Macao negotiation platform. ”
Thus, it denotes the author, "the role of Macau in paradiplomacy, but as an assistant to the implementation of central foreign policy, is also evident." However, "the paradiplomacy of Macao does not only reflect the diplomatic objective of helping the Chinese government to establish relations with Portuguese -speaking countries, but also the improvement of Macau's own international influence."
The doctoral thesis also presents a practical case analysis of Macau's relationship with the most striking Portuguese -speaking countries in the economic relationship with China, namely Angola and Brazil. "For Angola, Macao has played an approach role to China," as the African country needs "foreign investment for the hydroelectric power, infrastructure and agriculture sector." Thus, the binding axis is made at the Macao Forum, where "Angola can establish relations with the Chinese central government and cooperate on investment, in addition to the oil sector."
In addition, "most of China's investment in Angola comes from large companies, while small and medium -sized companies still depend mainly on Macau for commercial cooperation."
In the case of Brazil the situation is slightly different, because “in sino-Brazilian relations, the role of Macao is not obvious”, more “centered around the BRICS”, a group of emerging economies initially founded by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which today has ten member countries.
“Although the first ministerial meeting of the Macao Forum (2003) preceded the first meeting of the BRICS (2009) leaders, the impact of the Macao Forum on Sino-Brazilian Relations is not obviously as good as the influence established through direct meetings. Therefore, in the early days of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, relations between the two countries developed more at national level. ”
It is also highlighted that "although the role that Macao has in the opening of a door to the mainland China market has been established in Brazil's eyes, the impact of Macau on sino-Brazilian relations has not yet become obvious."
It is certain, however, that in recent years "the continuous development of the Macao Forum and the continuous improvement of organizational activities, its attraction to Brazil has become increasingly evident." “As Brazil tries to expand trade, commercial cooperation and investment with China will no longer be concentrated only in national business giants and will be increasingly targeted at private companies,” is still completed.
Regarding Portugal, the “attitude is very positive”, to the existing historical connection. “In many memos and statements signed with China, Macau has been stated to play an increasingly important role as a link between China and Portugal. Portugal and China have great technical cooperation in the domains of new energies, aerospace industry and other technological innovations. There is also a profound relationship of cooperation in the field of education. ”
It is also noteworthy that Portugal “not only signed cooperation agreements in the field of teaching with universities in the interior of China, but also signed several cooperation and exchange agreements with the main universities of Macao”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-19 00:24:24</pubDate></item><item><title>Vocational Education | Alert Study for Human Resources Failures in China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/18/ensino-profissional-estudo-alerta-para-falhas-em-recursos-humanos-na-china/</link><description>A study published in The China Quarterly concludes that there are still many questions to resolve so that technical-professional education in China can respond to human resources needs. The work warns of the “rapid massification” of this type of education, with priority for “number of enrollment over quality”
 
Technical-professional education in China has been popularized, but a recently published study in Cambridge University Press's “The China Quarterly” magazine, concludes that there are still gaps to find that courses can actually respond to the country's needs of labor in the industrial sector.
“More Graduates, Fewer Skills? Vocational Education Expansion and Skilled Labar Shortages in China ”[More graduates, less skills? The expansion of vocational education and qualified labor faults in China] is the name of the study developed by Xinmiao Song of the University of Lingnan, and Duudo XU of the University of Hong Kong Department of Sociology.
Academic work draws attention to the “disturbing tendency” of “rapid massification of vocational education, which gives priority to the number of enrollment over the quality of education” and “does not respond to the search for skills and qualified labor”.
In addition, the authors add to the “adverse consequences for both administrative management and teaching, caused by this scenario. “The development of competences often is up to post-school professional associations and an exclusive group of elite students. However, reform initiatives, such as the Manual Arts Campaign and competency contests, benefit only a few, without improving the prospects of employment of the student population in general. ”
Thus, the two academics argue that “more attention to the tensions inherent to China's teaching and vocational training system”, because “only when there is a deeper understanding of the underlying causes to the ineffective training of competences in vocational schools China can achieve its national objective of industrial modernization”.
The study was developed in two vocational schools, and interviews were conducted to 104 students. In addition, ethnographic data of four doctoral projects were used in the area of ​​vocational education, developed between October 2017 and December 2020.
It is also noted that the country needs “increasingly urgent” of qualified workers “due to world economic competition”. However, "despite the massive expansion of the teaching and vocational training system in the last two decades, there is still a significant deficit of qualified labor," there is "debates about the ineffectiveness of vocational education." These focus above all on, “in the absence of institutional synergies between teaching and industry, but they often ignore the conflicts inherent to the vocational education system and the processes of competency training at the micro level”.
Practical difficulties
To the “micro level”, that is, in schools, the authors denote the existence of several difficulties in the effective functioning of these courses in line with the intended results.
In secondary education there is “a delicate balance between the promotion of social equality and the development of skills”. However, "analysis indicates that, in the context of the rapid expansion of secondary education, schools have difficulty effectively harmonizing these objectives."
“In order to maintain a proper student body, schools and teachers are often obliged to compromise the quality of candidates and teaching standards in the classroom. This situation generates a change in daily pedagogy and school administration to preserve discipline and stability, thus attributing the development of competences and the selection of talents-ideally a mission from the whole school-to extra-curricular professional associations, pursued by a few, ”he is added.
It is also concluded that “the acquisition of competences is a multifaceted process, shaped by the dynamic interaction between educators and students”, because “the academic preparation of students and their motivations to learn are equally pertinent for the formation of microcompetence, as are the resources of schools and the capabilities of teachers”.
Thus, “the resolution of the ineffective formation of competencies requires more than the top to the base initiatives”, and an approach that recognizes the obstacles that students face in the acquisition of competences, as well as their seizures and uncertainties in the search for employment, is necessary.
The authors also talk about “elitism” in some formations related to handicraft courses and “competency contests”. "These initiatives may inadvertently suggest that handicrafts are reserved for a restricted number of people, as competencies contests often remain inaccessible to most vocational education students, both objective and psychologically."
Thus, the authors emphasize that "there is a significant undoing between this elitist approach to the acquisition of competences and the real conditions faced by vocational education students."
“The superficial promotion of manual labor spirit and the exclusivity of skills failed to truly resolve the challenges associated with the acquisition of skills, the search for employment and the commitment to follow technical professions among vocational education students,” is also mentioned.
Still, limitations in the study are referred to, namely the fact that it focuses only on public schools in higher secondary education, and the results may not completely represent other levels of vocational education, such as the higher institutes of vocational training ”.

Numbers from the “Factory of the World”
In the study is the intense industrial development that China has achieved in the last 40 years, emerging as the "factory of the world," as the authors describe, "taking advantage of their demographic dividends."
“However, the intensive model of labor growth has proved unsustainable due to population aging and intense global competition. To escape the 'medium performance trap', the Chinese government has launched a series of industrial modernization actions in the sectors of the transforming industry and services, ”but“ despite the ambitious agendas for the next decade, the persistent scarcity of qualified workers continues to make these efforts difficult, ”he is mentioned.
In 2020, there were more than 23 million vocational students, so "this scarcity of qualified labor is a surprise," is referred to in the study, which highlights "the substantial efforts and resources that the Chinese government has dedicated to improving vocational education in recent years."
For example, “Free Secondary Professional Education, the expansion of higher vocational facilities in one million students from 2019 to 2021 and the creation of universities of applied technology” emerged. In addition, the vocational education system watched an unprecedented trajectory, with enrollment in secondary professional schools higher than increasing from 4.56 million in 2004 to 7.11 million in 2009 ″.
In terms of the need for human resources, the study cites data from China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security for 80 cities in the country. "The ministry's quarterly reports have revealed that the work between work/person looking for qualified labor reached a historical peak of 2.0 in early 2020", and "higher level qualified workers, technicians and higher technicians had a particularly high demand."
It is also noted that the Ministry of Education predicts that the country continues to confront this year “with a deficit of 30 million qualified workers, which represents a 48 percent break in domains such as materials, energy savings and vehicles powered by new energies”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-18 00:25:20</pubDate></item><item><title>Work | Future Ready Talent Program released in Macau and Hong Kong</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/17/108890/</link><description>Wynn and insurer Aia are two of the 14 companies that are part of the “Future Ready” project, launched by LinkedIn on Thursday in Hong Kong. The program bets on vocational training in the two special administrative regions, with special focus on artificial intelligence
 
The LinkedIn social network, facing the world of work, launched last week in Hong Kong, a talent formation program that has the collaboration of 14 companies from the territory and Macao, namely the Aia insurer and the Wynn game operator. The program, titled “LinkedIn Future Ready”, aims to “equip professionals from Hong Kong and Macau with the skills needed to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market,” is referred to in a note of the organization.
The other companies or participating entities are the Cathay Pacific airline, the Chow Tai Fook jewelry group, the PLC group, the English Schools Foundation, the FWD group, the Hop Lun, the Link Asset Management, the MTR Corporation, the company that manages the hong Kong meter, and the PCCW consultant, without forgetting Prudential, Swire Properties, which operates in the real estate market, and the Hong Kong Jockey Club.
The program includes "initiatives for updating skills, knowledge exchange and [sharing] of data based information." Essentially, “Future Ready” intends to “equip companies with tools and resources needed to navigate a workforce transformation scenario and promote a culture of innovation”.
Given the latest projections of the social network, which published, in January, the report "Work Change Report - Ai Is Coming to Work" [Labor Change Report - Artificial Intelligence (IA) is coming to work], the program "Future Ready" aims to make more training in this area in both territories.
"The" LinkedIn Future Ready "program is a bold initiative that aims to support the work force in Hong Kong and to collect gaps in terms of skills, as well as unlocking new opportunities in growing economy," said Mei NG, director-general of Linkedin social network in Hong Kong.
The official also added that the social network will work closely with the 14 participating companies, to build “a more resilient workforce” by providing “companies that develop and implement innovative talent strategies and ensure that their employees are equipped with the skills needed to succeed in the future”.
Skills below
According to the same statement, before advancing to this training program, an assessment of markets was made in both territories. It is concluded that “Hong Kong and Macao perform well in cross-cutting skills and innovation-both essential to navigating the dynamic current business landscape”, and by transversal skills, “communication, teamwork and leadership” is understood.
In terms of innovation, another factor analyzed, "Hong Kong exceeds the APAC average [Asia-Pacific countries] in innovation skills, reinforcing its role as a future vision business center that also promotes industry transformation." However, the neighboring region “is behind APAC average in AI proficiency”, so the “Future Ready” program consider that there is “an urgent need for initiatives to improve skills to help enable the workforce to adapt without problems to technological advancement”.
There is, in this domain, a "growing demand for AI -related skills", as "77 percent of Hong Kong business leaders said they would hire a less experienced AI competencies rather than a more experienced candidate without these skills."
In addition, "although transverse skills remain the strongest area of ​​Hong Kong, the region continues to be below APAC average and is late in four of the five domains of critical skills evaluated."
One of the objectives of the program announced on Thursday is to “improve and requalify the labor” of both territories “for a future fueled with AI”, so that there is “a certain combination of technical and human skills”, constituting “a competitive advantage for professionals and organizations”.
The 14 partner companies will have access to more than 23,000 courses available on the “LinkedIn Learning” platform that are based on 41,000 skills sets, namely “curated learning pathways, technology training, AI training and state -of -the -art learning resources”, it is explained.
The future accelerates
According to the same report released by LinkedIn in January, AI's growing adoption worldwide will lead to a "search for new jobs and skills." The social network data show that "more than 10 percent of hired workers currently have positions that did not exist in 2000, including functions such as data scientist, social networking manager, sustainability manager, customer success manager and AI engineer."
In the concrete case of Hong Kong, by 2030, “60 percent of all skills used to do a job will have changed, with the innovations of accelerating this transformation to 80 percent”, is mentioned. Thus, it is concluded that "this rapid pace of change has created a gap of competencies that is difficult to conform in the short term."
In addition to betting on professionals, the “Future Ready” program also wants to promote ideas and debates, promising, for example, “quarterly round tables for executives” and “with sector leaders to discuss the evolution of jobs, skills and learning requirements”. “The program will also provide a platform for the sharing of best practices, influencing the broader development of the workforce in all sectors,” is still added.
Also noteworthy is that the LinkedIn report on changes in work structures describe the most usual forms of AI use, namely communication in human resources or marketing. Thus, "recruiters who use LinkedIn's AI -assisted messages to involve candidates are registering an acceptance rate 44 percent higher compared to the AI ​​-free messages." In addition, “marketers who use LinkedIn's ad campaign creation tool, Accelerate, are presenting a cost per 42 percent lower compared to the classic campaigns” of this social network.
For this report were held several inquiries, namely more than 2,500 entrepreneurs from five countries (United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and India). The questionnaire focused on executives from various business areas (human resources, operations or marketing) was made in nine country and had 19,991 participants from companies with over 1000 employees. This inquiry was held from 26 November and December 13 last year.
In worldwide terms, in 2030 about 70 percent of each worker's tools and skills will change, with “emerging as a catalyst”, and “IMA investments [by companies] are starting to compensate: in the last two years, 51 percent of businesses that have adopted the general AI reported an increase in revenues of 10 percent or more”. “Unsurprisingly, 88 percent of top executives with top management positions said AI adoption to help accelerate business is something important to develop next year,” one reads.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Drainage | Ron Lam calls for unification of the legislation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/drenagens-ron-lam-pede-unificacao-da-legislacao/</link><description>Deputy Ron Lam defended the unification of the legislation on water drainage in the territory, according to the newspaper or Mun. According to the publication in Chinese language, the deputy considers the unification of the drainage daughters -in -law. Macao Water Water and Drainage Regulation has been in force for over 40 years.
Ron Lam justified the position with the need to adopt more demanding standards regarding the drainage of wastewater treatment stations, due to the complaints of Colaane residents of the odors issued by the unit operating in the village.
For the deputy, the lack of unification of drainage standards and the outdated content of the water and wastewater drainage regulation make legal requirements not to respond to the environmental protection needs of a modern society.
In addition, Ron Lam pointed out that more than half of wastewater is drained by wastewater treatment stations in Macau without receiving a secondary treatment. This option means that before it is returned to the sea, water goes through the treatment of slag separation.
The deputy warned that treatment cannot only depend on dilution to reduce the impact of pollution, because the practice impairs the environment.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 01:27:56</pubDate></item><item><title>AL | Legislative elections scheduled for September 14</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/al-eleicoes-legislativas-marcadas-para-14-de-setembro/</link><description>The chief executive yesterday marked the day of legislative elections for September 14. The limit of the expenses of each application was set at more than 3.5 million patacas. The election campaign starts at the end of August, according to instructions from the Electoral Commission released yesterday
 
Sam Hou Fai yesterday marked the elections that will determine the cast of deputies of the eighth legislature of the Legislative Assembly. September 14 was the date chosen, according to the executive order signed by the chief executive, published yesterday in the official bulletin.
In a separate order, Sam Hou Fai has set the maximum limit of expenses that each application can spend on the elections by nearly 3.55 million.
Yesterday was also marked by the meeting of the Electoral Affairs Commission of the Legislative Assembly (Caeal), and subsequent publication of the instructions for the suffrage that establishes the following rules during the election campaign, which starts at midnight on August 30 and ends on September 12. The instructions published by Caeal on its official page also establish the voting methods, the duty of neutrality and impartiality of public entities and equivalent entities. This duty of neutrality and impartiality has been in force since yesterday and has to be respected by administration bodies, legal persons of public law, society with public capital, as well as the concessionaires, who are prohibited from favoring or impairing candidates for elections. Caeal indicates that those who break these duties in the performance of their duties can be penalized with three years in prison or fine up to 360 days.
It is necessary to look
Yesterday, during a press conference, Caeal President Seng Ioi Man stressed the importance of activities organized by candidacies associations could not mention electoral information, or campaign political proposals. Even though during these activities they are distributed gifts, memories, supermarket discount vouchers, candidates can participate in these events, provided that no election or campaign is discussed.
At the same time, the corruption commissioner's deputy, Wong Kim Kim Fong, said, according to the Chinese channel of Radio Macau, that legislative elections are one of this year's most important tasks of the corruption committee. The official also revealed that a 24 -hour line will open and an online platform to submit election complaints.
Electoral patriotism
Next Thursday, CAEAL will make available for the forms to build applications and, from there begins the deadline to submit the candidacy committees, which ends on June 6. During this period, Caeal will evaluate the legality of the process and will be given a week to "supply existing deficiencies."
The president of Caeal pointed out yesterday that this is the first after the amendments to the law that regulates the elections for the Legislative Assembly, according to the principles of national security. As such, the legislative act “is of great importance”. Thus, Seng Ioi Man has ensured that Caeal "will consciously implement the principle of Macao governed by Patriots", "promoting several high quality electoral works, creating a fairer, equitable and clean environment for elections, and ensuring that elections are completed in a harmonious and ordained manner."
The official assured that Caeal will decide whether candidates are eligible to run for elections, in accordance with the opinion of the State Security Defense Commission, which is advised by members of the Central Popular Government's Board of Cabinet.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 01:10:41</pubDate></item><item><title>COVER CLASS | Chui Sai Peng asks for care with changes</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/cheque-pecuniario-chui-sai-peng-pede-cuidado-com-mudancas/</link><description>Deputy Chui Sai Peng warned of the impacts of changing the pecuniary reimbursement program, known as a cash check that is distributed to residents.
Speaking to TDM, Chui explained that any change has to be well explained and result in a good decision. “Old habits are difficult to change, but changes may happen. You need to give and take. It is necessary to make concessions to make a choice that benefits most people, but it is also necessary to persuade the people that the action will produce results, ”he said. “We have to have a good government, which not only can make a good decision, but also give good explanations.
These two things have to be holding hands, whatever the result, ”he added. Last week, Sam Hou Fai admitted the hypothesis of failing to distribute the checks of 10,000 patacas to permanent residents and 6,000 patacas for non-permanent to people unconnected with the territory.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 01:02:22</pubDate></item><item><title>Communication | Ng kuok cheong highlights caution of sam hu fai</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/comunicacao-ng-kuok-cheong-destaca-cautela-de-sam-hou-fai/</link><description>Former Deputy NG Kuok Cheong considered that the lack of direct interaction between the chief executive and the media is due to the ruler of the ruler to make statements that he became susceptibilities of the central authorities. This was how NG tried to explain the fact that in two months of governance, Sam Hou Fai only answered questions from the media.
Speaking to the All About Macau newspaper, NG indicated that there is a lot of pressure for local rulers to “tell the story of Macau well”. Therefore, he considered that Sam Hou Fai prefers to speak little, even though the risk of his image is damaged by the population of Macau, to make statements that create problems with the central government. "By reducing the number of public interventions, it can minimize the assumptions of having problems, because currently everything you say you have to follow the instructions of the central authorities," said the former deputy.
NG also explained that the executive has a much more cautious posture of communication against the previous ones, and that he only pronounces on governance issues when he feels he can "tell the story of Macau well."
On the other hand, NG Kuok Cheong argued that Sam Hou Fai's main agenda is to maintain an elite governance system, in which a set of individuals make all decisions. However, at the same time, there is an effort to give an opening image to the opinions of the population, even if they are not adopted.
Regarding the Macao elite, NG indicated that based on meetings with certain associations in the first months of governance, Sam Hou Fai showed an effort to increase the confidence of the local elite in the governance model of the central authorities.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 00:58:34</pubDate></item><item><title>Integration | Member of CCPPC wants Macao buses in Hengqin</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/integracao-membro-da-ccppc-quer-autocarros-de-macau-em-hengqin/</link><description>Lee Chong Cheng wants to facilitate circulation to the mountain island to bring more residents to the in -depth cooperation zone. In turn, businessman Frederico MA defends the diversification of hengqin, which he considers very dependent on the Chimelong Park
 
Macao member at the National Committee of the Chinese Political Advisory Conference (CCPPC) Lee Chong Cheng advocates the circulation of Macao's public buses on Mountain Island to make life easier for residents. The desire was expressed in statements to the newspaper or Mun, before Lee Chong Cheng travels to Beijing, where you will participate in the "two meetings."
From the perspective of the president of the Macao Workers' Associations Federation, if buses can circulate between Macau and Hengqin, the will of residents of moving to the other side of the border will increase "significantly."
Currently, to move to Mountain Island, residents need to take transport from Macau to the border. Once on the other side of the border, they can resort to taxis or the public transport network of Hengqin. Lee wants Macau's buses to come directly on Mountain Island without changing transportation.
To promote hengqin circulation, Lee Chong Cheng also expects central authorities to make changes to the circulation of private cars on the border.
Lee suggests more flexibility of border passage procedures, so that special needs passengers are not required to get out of vehicles. Currently, people over 70 years old, or less than 10, pregnant and disabled, may remain inside the car during border inspection. According to the Faom leader, the conditions should be more flexible to cover people 60 or older, young people up to 15 years old, and for those seeking medical care.
As for the current measure of circulation of Macao vehicles in Guangdong Province, Lee Chong Cheng expects central government authorities to establish a specific corridor on the border only for Macao cars during weekends and holidays. Currently, the corridor is shared with Hong Kong vehicles.
Industrial expansion
In turn, Frederico Ma, also a member of Macau at CCPPC, considers that Macau and Hengqin should take advantage of the synergies to promote the entry of more mashed industries in the cooperation zone.
In addition, the official who also chairs the Macau Commercial Association recalled that the development of hengqin tourism must be diversified, as all tourist attractions are currently passing through the Chimelong theme park and hotel.
Frederico MA argues that Hengqin cannot depend on a single project, and advocates greater industrial development of hengqin, to take advantage of local advantages and diversify the economy. As an option for diversification, Frederico MA defends the bet on hengqin acupuncture, considering that it is an increasingly adopted practice by athletes in international sports competitions.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 00:57:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Demography | Birth is a “social responsibility”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/demografia-natalidade-e-uma-responsabilidade-social/</link><description>The chief executive considered that the increase in birth is “a social responsibility”, in statements made at a time when the government intends to have more children.
“The birth allowance is attributed to each of the parents, who receive more than 10,000 patacas. There are no other subsidies related to childhood assistance, so we will consider other ways to encourage birth, ”said the government leader, quoted by the Macao da TDM channel.
"If the financial situation allows it, the government can signal the community, supporting young parents to have more children, but we also consider this to be a social responsibility," he added.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:27:31</pubDate></item><item><title>Supports | Sam Hou Fai prepares changes in the pecuniary check</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/apoios-sam-hou-fai-prepara-mudancas-no-cheque-pecuniario/</link><description>The chief executive admitted that he will promote changes in the distribution of the cash check next year, considering that a lot of money was spent on this social program.
In the statements made to the end of the media last week, Sam Hou Fai stated that since the check began to be distributed in 2008, the government spent about 92.1 billion patacas, which understands that it is a large amount. “It's a lot of money. It is a number that exceeds 92 billion patacas, ”said Sam, quoted by the All About Macau portal. “Everyone can give their opinion [about the check], and some people have already given their opinion. This year the check will be distributed. And next year how will the distribution be? It depends on the global economic conjuncture, ”said the ruler.
This year, the pecuniary check budget is 7.48 billion patacas, with permanent residents receiving 10,000 patacas and the non-permanent 6,000 patacas.
In recent times, a campaign has been intensified to end the check distribution to residents who do not spend half of the year in Macao. And this aspect was highlighted by the Chief Executive, who pointed out to have heard opinions asking for support to reflect "justice, accuracy and an effective connection to the masters."
Despite the “a lot of money” spent on the pecuniary checks, the amount did not prevent the government from accumulating a financial reserve with more than 600 billion Patacas or following a policy of large investments, with buildings of several millions of millions of patacas, such as Metro Ligeiro, Taipa maritime terminal or Macau Bridge.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:25:45</pubDate></item><item><title>Improve the economy of Macau (II)</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/aperfeicoar-a-economia-de-macau-ii/</link><description>Last week, we analyzed the issue of directing visitors from traditional tourist attractions to community zones, thus increasing local commerce revenues in areas where residents live their daily lives. Thus, more people could benefit from tourists consumption and the number of stores closed could be reduced.
For this plan to be successful, we must start receiving concerts and create careers of tourist buses between the show rooms and the community tourist areas. Concert organizers will have to sign contracts with the artists. If there is more than an artist to act, contracts should be signed with each of them. The Macao society should decide whether buses will be assigned by local transport companies or other companies. The company that is in charge of this service must decide whether or not the trips will be free.
With tourist buses make the connecting places of concerts and community tourism areas, tourists can easily be transported. As we mentioned, these places are located in the areas where residents live their daily lives. Originally, these places were not considered touristy. Therefore, the first task is to attract tourists to these areas and the second is to take them to shop at local stores. This second question will have to be addressed and resolved by interested traders.
Most of the products in Macau stores come from Zhuhai, Zhongshan and other places. Currently, most tourists visiting Macau and Hong Kong come from the interior of China. If we forward tourists from the Great Bay area to the community zones and expect you to shop at local stores we will not be very successful because the products that are there for sale are available in the cities where they reside.
Also, these products are more expensive in Macau than in the Great Bay area and no one will want to buy at higher prices which can buy cheaper. It should be not to forget that since the movement known as “the cars that go north”, that is, the mass travel of residents of Macao to shop in the cities near the interior of China, local consumption has fallen significantly. This was also one of the reasons for reducing local consumption. It is not surprising that the fall in consumption has resulted in the end of several stores that were unable to pay the rentals.
There is only one way to solve the problem that residents leave the city to shop and also take tourists from the interior of China to consume in community areas, and this has higher quality products, innovating and courage to look for change.
There is a famous hot pot restaurant in mainland China. When it opened, it was just a small unknown store. Later, as the business flourished, they were increasingly opening branches. Hot Pot's restaurant was diversifying its offer and started selling its products in supermarkets, packed in plastic boxes that contained everything that was needed to heat the meals. It was a portable hot pot.
Customers can purchase the meal without having to move to the restaurant. Also, when people go to hot pot restaurants are impregnated with a strong odor from meals. This chain has created a head washing service so that the odor disappears. All of these services have to do with "innovation." In management, there is a theory that advocates the innovation of companies. If our company stagnates, but our competitors evolve, it means that others change until us. If our competitor is better, we will be eliminated.
In addition to bravely looking for change, the type of products sold should also be adjusted. Tourists in the Great Bay area do not easily buy products they can purchase at home. However, if the products sold in Macau stores have Portuguese elements that represent the cultural fusion of Macao, they will become more attractive.
Macao young products such as hand and t-shirts reflect the mindset of local youth and are a symbol of their way of being in life, which is precisely what adherents of immersive tourism are looking for. Many of the Imanes for refrigerators sold in stores represent macao tourist sites. What if instead we would make i imans with specialties from Macau? When tourists see these images in their refrigerators, they will naturally remember the time they have spent in Macao. They will again evoke these flavors and revive their memories, which will always be fresh.
To summarize, creating a special bus career to get the public from the concerts to consume in community zones is a strategy that is worth trying. But it is essential that stores in these zones have the courage to change and provide unique and good quality products and services. Only in this way can trade truly benefit from the visit of tourists.
Tourists consumption in community zone stores is particularly important. This consumption represents recipes for stores. As these revenues increase, taxes that will pay the government will also increase. The Macao government can have more revenues creating new taxes. This way we can enjoy the benefits of "a visa for multiple purposes." In this sense, the whole society of Macau can profit.

I decided to sit down and write in the notebook the first lines of this chronicle about what I had just seen and about the latest shocking news from last week.
Fifty years ago, Covilhã was a set of admirable houses without any skyscrapers. Today, the mountain town is so horrible full of buildings everywhere in the city. Various floors are endless. I was thinking how great the real estate business is. It must be a better business than the most profitable in the world, ice cream, pizzas and coffee. Once, I went to Lisbon a week to visit some family members and in one avenue I told ten real estate.
The Portuguese know that they can rarely buy or lease a house without a real estate and that the commissions of these companies make a grand profit. And if they are intended to acquire a land, the ideal is that all the paperwork is treated by a real estate, whether the land near a city, a village or even in a rustic interior. Real estate agents deal with everything and people are subject to what is defined in the business of this type of intermediation with regard to real estate, land and what you have to pay for real estate.
Well, last week the political discussion walked around real estate. I will call them political real estate. Why? Because after a secretary of state of the current government was fired when it came to the fire that owned a real estate and was simultaneously participating in the soil law, the media brought to the collation that Prime Minister Luís Montenegro had a real estate and claimed to have sold his quota to his wife and children. The matter was at Baila in the Assembly of the Republic and the opposition deputies were not satisfied with the explanations on the subject, presented by the Chief Executive.
As for us, Luís Montenegro had no transparency when interrogated on who the customers of his family business were. It was important that if they knew who the business partners were, because it will always be the suspicion that these clients could enjoy government benefits. Even the weekly Expresso, in its edition last Friday, reported that the 'Solverde' casinos pay 4,500 euro a month to the Montenegro company. Then, well, then it has been a drain of news about real estate arrested by government members.
The minister of territorial cohesion, Castro Almeida, who has the protection of the changes to the Soil Law, also had a real estate and came to say that he had already sold his part, but only after the "scolding" with the prime minister. However, a different position was assumed by the Minister of Justice, Rita Júdice, who publicly said that “he has no intention to get rid of his personal heritage, constituted with his work and his family”, namely the four companies with real estate business that he is a partner.
The truth is that from culture to work, passing the defense and presidency of the Council of Ministers, several ministries employ current and former partners of real estate companies. In the Ministry of Labor, it is already public that Minister Maria do Rosário Palma Ramalho includes the management of real estate heritage in her company ‘Palma Ramalho, LDA’. But it is not the only one: the Secretary of State for Labor, Adriano Rafael Moreira, also includes in the oblect of his consulting firm the “Heritage Management, and may for this purpose, to alienate, acquire and lease real estate and resale the acquired”.
The company is now called ‘Orbis Terra-Consulting and Management, LDA’, a more discreet name than the previous one with regard to the connection to real estate and the ruler is a single partner. But the appetite for real estate business in the executive of Luís Montenegro is not exhausted in these rulers and even the head of the dwelling folder at Miguel Pinto Luz's ministry was a partner of a company that is dedicated to the purchase and sale of real estate goods. This is' promobuilding-LDA real estate services.
The company where Patrícia Gonçalves da Costa was a manager between 2010 and 2015 and minority partner until 2019 also holds 50 percent of ‘Urbanquestion, LDA’, another company created in 2023 with the same object that includes the purchase and sale of real estate, construction of proceedings for marketing and promotion of urbanization studies. In the Ministry of Defense, the former CDS deputy Álvaro Castelo Branco, now Deputy Secretary of State, is a partner of ‘Rent 4 You - Society Imobiliária, LDA’. This society is also part of the former PSD deputy and current member of the Board of Directors of AICEP Paulo Rios de Oliveira.
The history of business activities of the real estate branch extends to the Ministry of Culture. The newly named Secretary of State Alberto Santos detained 90 percent of the Society ‘Villa Gallaecia-Mediation Imobiliária, LDA’, dedicated to real estate mediation and raising, but also to the evaluation of real estate and consulting.
And the Minister Dalila Rodrigues herself had quota in a family company: it is Rita Aguiar Rodrigues Architects Lda, which as the name indicates provides architectural services, but also includes in its object the construction and remodeling of buildings and the purchase, sale and resale of real estate. In a statement issued last Tuesday night, both the minister and the Secretary of State confirmed that they detained those quotas in societies, but gave them before taking office in the government. And in the Assembly of the Republic? Well, do not go open -mouthed.
In Parliament, there is also no shortage of deputies with companies in the real estate business. In addition to the four parliamentarians of the arrival, the party that has made possible and has been postponing the vote that can spoke the changes to the law of soils, are many examples in the PS benches and especially the PSD. Giving the example of real estate entrepreneurship in a country where the price of houses and incomes is unbearable for those who live with low wages is the President of the Assembly of the Republic.
José Pedro Aguiar Branco is a partner of ‘PortoCovi - Management and Administration of Goods LDA’, which has as its object the purchase and sale of movable and immovable property, lease, management and administration of own goods or other people and service provision. Confronted with public dissemination about his company, Aguiar-Branco responded to journalists complaining of "voyeurism" about political positions, where "everything is sparkling: their heritage, their situation from the financial point of view, all that has to do with a particular collection, although there is no suspicion."
And what did Aguiar-white wanted? May the journalists be "little monkeys" to silence, not listen and not see?

My understanding is no longer based only on countless readings, but also on direct experience with the conflict of couples. I leave that these experiences resonate in my knowledge and my therapeutic practice, in the hope that they result in richer reflections in this space of writing. Today I want to tell you about love in the storm.
A love relationship presupposes an affective bond. We can discuss the many possible forms of “couple”, but I invite you to focus on the idea of ​​two people who find themselves and seek to connect through what they are in the most intimate and deep. Usually, in this kind of relationship, there is sex - the mechanism of connection par excellence, which brings us to our most primary desires. Theory suggests that we choose our partners because they fit the long history of our affective connections, starting with the most primary relationships, such as our parents. Thus, we establish romantic bonds that, while offering the possibility of emotional reparation, also feed our dysfunctions. Love does not exist without this polarity. The bond lives in the tension between finding the love of our lives and the risk of this same love becoming in our greatest enemy. This is, of course, a caricature, but I want them to be aware of this duality.
It is common for couples, when they become aware of this tension, seek therapy. Then comes an distressing question: How can the person who love to awaken me so much sadness, anger or frustration? It is the very evolution of the relationship that leads to these winding paths. Our beliefs, the way they shape our behavior and even our understanding of romantic love influence the way we deal with this ambivalence. The truth is that we have prepared little for this reality. Recently, a husband in deep anguish shared with me: “I didn't betray, nor walk behind anyone. I don't realize why we are like this. ”
In couple therapy, the goal is not to eliminate the conflict, but to understand it. The mismatch is inevitable, which is why tools are sought to better deal with it. One of the pillars of this process is to create a space where one can talk frankly about the challenges of the relationship. However, this mismatch is emotionally charged and not always easy to resolve. It is not enough to offer a new map for the couple to follow a different path. It is not even the therapist's role to give simple solutions. To reconstruct a relationship, it is necessary to face a storm - uncontrolled rainwater, wind at 100 km/h and deafening thunder. The therapist helps navigate this storm so that the couple understands that love contains in itself this disruptive possibility. Deep down, the therapist confirms that even if suffering seems atrocious and the confusing mismatch, it's okay. The mismatch is part of life.
The storm is a symptom of a primitive state, a reflex of the body in the face of the frustration of their emotional needs - they are proximity or removal. It is a state in which rational thinking is overshadowed by instinctive reaction. It can manifest itself as a struggle or escape, as if the partner were a predator, or as avoidance, an attempt to protect himself from a partner who seems to consume the little emotional energy that remains. Ultimately, the way we react to mismatch is linked to the way we deal with the affective bond.
Regardless of the therapeutic approach used, all psychotherapeutic schools converge on this essential strategy: to make these internal mechanisms obvious. From this awareness, therapy helps the couple create new emotional "dances", promoting understanding and empathy to make the mismatch less destructive.
Of course, there are couples who come to therapy at a point where the therapeutic space serves to prepare divorce or separation. In such cases, the mediation offered by the therapist allows them to maintain forms of communication based on respect. Many therapists “divorce” couples, and this is also a successful result.
The stigma associated with therapy in general is a barrier. In addition to sporadic romantic dinner, or quality time together, which many therapists will surely prescribe, therapy aims to go to other sites. Investing in relationship is essential for love, either through therapy or honest conversations about the couple's dynamics. Because love does not simply happen, it survives between comfort, pleasure and conflict.</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 01:08:11</pubDate></item><item><title>Geogostronomy and the role of Portuguese cuisine in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/a-geogastronomia-e-o-papel-da-gastronomia-portuguesa-em-macau-2/</link><description>(continuation)
Kitchen chiefs are increasingly experiencing melting dishes that incorporate international flavors, remaining faithful to Portuguese roots. The emergence of new gastronomic trends, such as “farm-to-table” and sustainable cuisine, reflects the growing awareness of the origin and quality of food. Social networks have also transformed the way culinary experiences are shared and perceived. Platforms like Instagram have made it easier for bosses to show their dishes to a global audience, attracting food enthusiasts and contributing to the promotion of macanese cuisine.
Through visually appealing presentations, bosses may involve customers and encourage the appreciation of intricate flavors of Luso-Macaense cuisine. Several academic analyzes of Macau's geogostronomic landscape reveal the complex interaction between culture and food. Scholars emphasize the concept of identity, illustrating how culinary practices reflect the cultural heritage and values ​​of the community. The mix of Portuguese and Chinese culinary traditions creates a distinct identity for Macao, reinforcing its position as a cultural cauldron.
The investigation suggests that gastronomic experiences are vital to fostering a sense of belonging among residents and promoting community ties. The culinary events and festivals that celebrate Luso-Macaense gastronomy further reinforce the community's involvement and promote a shared cultural identity, encouraging pride in local traditions and values. The role of Portuguese cuisine in Macau is ready for continuous evolution. The growing awareness of consumers for sustainability and health will probably shape culinary trends. Kitchen heads may prioritize the use of local and organic ingredients, while exploring innovative cooking techniques that honor traditional practices.
Promoting educational programs that emphasize the importance of culinary heritage can help ensure that future generations enjoy and continue the tradition of Portuguese gastronomy. By promoting connections between chefs and consumers, Macau can maintain his unique cuisine in a constantly changing global landscape. The role of Portuguese gastronomy in Macau serves as a rich example of how cultural and geographical factors intertwine to shape culinary practices. As Macau sails for contemporary influences and anticipates future developments, the essence of Portuguese cuisine continues to prosper and evolve, promising a vibrant and dynamic culinary future.
The evolution of macanese culinary culture is also influenced by the change in consumer habits and globalization. The increase in gastronomic tourism in Macao led to a greater interest in traditional dishes, as visitors eager for experiencing local flavors exploit the gastronomic landscape. Restaurants can respond by raising traditional recipes to exquisite gastronomic experiences. Events such as the “International Festival of Cities of Gastronomy, Macao” also promotes the appreciation for local cuisine, drawing attention to the skills of local bosses and the importance of culinary heritage.
In recent years, conscious effort has been assisted to preserve traditional methods, simultaneously integrating modern techniques and global influences. The introduction of elements such as molecular gastronomy begins to be a practice in various luxury restaurants in Macao, creating a new dialogue between traditional dishes and contemporary food science. These innovative approaches challenge the notion of authenticity, suggesting that tradition is not static but dynamic. While there are purists who advocate the preservation of original revenues, others advocate a reinterpretation that reflects contemporary food and preferences.
The sustainability of Macanese cuisine in the modern context is another critical area to examine. Environmental awareness began to influence culinary practices, with an increasing emphasis on the use of local ingredients. This change improves the freshness of foods served in Macanese restaurants. Establishments are increasingly highlighting their commitment to ecological practices and can integrate in their sustainable seafood menus and organic vegetables. These practices ensure that although the kitchen remains rooted in its historical context, it continues to evolve in a sustainable way.
In addition, the intersection of global trends had an impact on Macao's traditional culinary landscape. The global fascination with the melting kitchen encouraged bosses to experience unconventional combinations. This mixture of culinary traditions can be seen in the popularity of dishes such as the Macaense-Taieman lobster curry or almond cookies influenced by Portuguese and Chinese pastry techniques. These developments reflect the evolution of the taste of both local inhabitants and tourists, reflecting a broader culinary narrative that challenges traditional concepts of what constitutes macanese food.
The future of Macanese cuisine seems promising, characterized by continuous exploration of identity, innovation and cultural exchange. As the culinary scene evolves, it is crucial that chiefs and gastronomy enthusiasts find a balance between respect for traditional methods and the adoption of new techniques. The potential for greater international recognition remains strong, particularly in the field of exquisite restoration, where macanese flavors can be presented with modern interpretations.
However, challenges persist, namely as regards the preservation of authentic culinary practices. Discussions may arise around cultural appropriation as macanese dishes gain popularity and are adapted to various culinary contexts. The challenge lies in ensuring the maintenance of the integrity of traditional dishes and, at the same time, interacting effectively with a global audience. This dialogue enhances the delicate balance between adaptation and authenticity in culinary heritage.
Macau's Portuguese cuisine represents a rich tapestry of flavors formed through centuries of cultural exchange, innovation and adaptation. The historical context provides a basis for understanding how these diverse influences intertwined, leading to a distinct culinary identity.
Influential heads have defended this kitchen, ensuring its relevance in modern gastronomy, while sustainability efforts aim to keep it linked to local traditions. The interaction between tradition and modernity, authenticity and innovation will continue to shape the future of Macanese cuisine. The enthusiasm surrounding this culinary landscape promises to attract global interest, immortalizing the flavors and narratives that define this unique gastronomic heritage.</description><pubDate>2025-02-27 02:00:39</pubDate></item><item><title>Young Timorese wants to be the best chef and expand cooking in the country</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/jovem-timorense-quer-ser-o-melhor-chef-e-expandir-culinaria-do-pais/</link><description>The Timorense Melquirudi da Cunha began cooking with his mother and today tries to realize the dream of being the best chief cooking of Timor-Leste and promoting the traditional gastronomy of his country in the world.
The 19-year-old studies cooking at the Timor-Leste Development Agency (ETDA), where he told Lusa, "he gained more interest and passion for gastronomy." It was through that formation center that Melqui, diminutive by which he is known, represented the country in the international competition of young cook, which took place in early February in India, accompanied by his mentor, Marcelino Freitas.
“Although Timor-Leste has not reached a high classification, we learned many things. How to better manage the time, use ingredients properly and to have dishes correctly, ”explained Melqui.
“I also learned a lot from the exchange of experiences with heads from other countries and highlighted traditional Timor-Leste dishes to promote our country's products at the international level,” said the young man.
To India, Melqui took a Timor-Leste coffee pudding, considered one of the best in the world, and “Kulu Bafa”, coconut-cooked bread fruit, a traditional dish from the municipality of Baucau. "They were impressed with the taste and the fact that they never experienced them before," he said.
The young man, who wants to be one of the “best heads of Timor-Leste”, also intends to promote the country's gastronomy and his traditional dishes such as “Tukir”, a bamboo trunk, and “Saboko”, spicy fish.
Nutritional problems
Despite a rich and nutritious kitchen, data from the world food program report that 47 percent of children in the country under 5 are growth compromised, 8.6 percent suffer from acute malnutrition and 23 percent of women of reproductive age (between 15 and 49 years) have anemia.
Asked about the reasons for the Timorese not to have a healthy diet, mentor and chef Marcelino Freitas said one of the reasons is increasingly consuming imported products instead of places.
“If we look at the conditions and the situation of Timor-Leste we see that the country is full of local products. We talk about poor nutrition in Timor, but we consume, mostly, foods imported from other countries, which often contain sugar and excess fat, ”said the cook and also a trainer ETDA.
“We have a lot of healthy foods, but we still don't know how to use them correctly. Therefore, from now on, it is essential to develop a more productive thinking, ”he said.
According to Marcelino Freitas, the Timorese have to eat more sweet potatoes, cassava, and yams and other traditional foods and also learn to innovate and turn the way food cooks. The trainer also stressed that local products are rich in quality proteins, essential for healthy eating.
"The challenge now is to turn these foods to be healthier and can respond to individual and community needs," he said, appealing to the appreciation of local products so that people can have a better physical condition and more balanced health.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 02:01:36</pubDate></item><item><title>Cinemateca Passion | Oscars and South Korea on this month's screen</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/cinemateca-paixao-oscares-e-coreia-do-sul-na-tela-deste-mes/</link><description>“Emilia Pérez”, a film with great presence in the Oscars, and “Mickey 17”, the latest of South Korean director Bong Joon Ho, author of “Parasites”, are some of the great highlights that Cinemateca Passion brings to the cinema rooms for this month

"Export of services and internal demand (including private consumer expense, government's final consumer consumer expense grew 9.2 and 2.3 percent, respectively, in annual terms," ​​reads the same note. Regarding the growth of service exports, DSEC highlights the impetus given by the annual increase of 23.8 percent of the number of visitors entries in 2024.
The determining factor for the positive evolution of GDP was the 21.8 percent increase in game service exports over last year. Growth that contrasted with annual descent of 6.1 percent of exports of other tourist services, "due to the basis of relatively high comparison of the year 2023". Still, in this chapter, the 2024 record represented a growth of 13 per 2019.
The DSEC also mentioned that foreign trade in goods and exports and imports of goods fell last year, respectively, 14.5 and 7.6 percent, when a 2023 comparison. Also according to the data, private consumption increased by 4.9 percent, in annual terms, “thanks to the continuing recovery of economic activities and the uninterrupted labor market stability”.
DSEC also revealed that “the GDP per capita, which measures the average value of the goods and services produced per person, was 587,922 patacas”, which represents a 7.6 percent increase compared to 2023.
The other side
In the opposite direction, the government's expense fell, in the period under analysis, 5.1 percent, after the end of economic support measures, launched to relieve the impact of the pandemic, with the DSEC to highlight the consumption card rounds released by 2023.
In the public sector, the investment in equipment rose 1.2 percent, compared to 2023, while the investment in construction fell 10 percent, “due to the completion of part of the large public works”, reads in the note. With regard to private, investment in equipment grew 31.1 percent and under construction rose 5.1 percent in annual terms.
In the last quarter of 2024, Macau GDP increased 3.4 percent, compared to the same period of 2023. DSEC stressed that internal demand and exports of services had homologous additions of 2.8 and 2.1 percent, respectively.

A renovated Ukrainian, with the same name of the president, guilty Zelensky about the extension of the conflict that destroyed his village. Zelensky, the village, who has never left his land, now lives mortified because his favorite gravedigger died in the bomber.
This Zelensky, the village, represents half the world that reproves the other Zelensky, the villain, for not wanting to negotiate with Putin.
Negotiate what? The invader enters us through the house, pies us his wife and daughter (cf. Recent UN report on Ukraine violations in this “special operation”), an act that forced us to watch, and then we say: High there, we are for peace, but we have to negotiate: You have not said the name you want to give to children!
A peace that is not worthy is but a cessation of rights. As severe as Russophobia that Putin inflicts his people.

In a lunch with several guests I hear a friend, who declares himself a spiritist, explaining about the particularities of his belief, in a serene and balanced way, would even say, without "irrationalism". He discussed long and serenely, devoid of any fanatical proselytizing. “Here is someone to whom belief brought weighting!” I thought, a rare alliance.
However, at one point a phrase that horrify me. He says, “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!” And I enter the voracious fauces of holism. Because holismo has a pathological aspect like all good things, a side of shadow.
Two examples: In Hinduism there is less sensitivity to existential dramas, if that child suffers in this life this is only an expression of the strict karmic symmetry, an effect of the acts she committed in her previous life. In Africa it is not accepted that death may have been accidental, and many women are accused by the dead family of having caused her husband's death, in an act of manifest dementia, and, in the blatant majority of cases, in a huge injustice to his wife - madness that spreads and infiltrates the social fabric.
Buddhism has introduced compassion and Christianity to Caritas, trying to break with this logic, but in many other beliefs and religions the cage of causalities prevails over sensitivity to experience, the need to respond to the now.
It is a tremendous logic that transforms the world into a platonic stage, where we are just the shadows of something -an inextricable law -in a determinism that calcines all singularities, but strangely fascinates many.
The conquest of modernity has anchored in the conquest of chance and random, subtracting the incidences of a life to this fierce determinism that closed the world in a web. When the Renaissance freed the body from the influence of the stars, at this moment sexuality was relieved of guilt and individualism and their volition could emerge.
There is an unequivocal moral implication in the phrase “There is no chance, nothing happens by chance!”, Which should work as a key to self-knowledge and self-judgment, but usually this phrase is managed to seek a reason for things abroad from us in the other. It is an alibi.
There is a holistic temptation in the world today, as in the Middle Ages there was a satanic temptation, without great reflection on its consequences. Because it is not enough we want to connect everything in a resonant chain of affection. Even the most unexpected: affection itself can kill.
I realize, thanks to this cultured, balanced, intelligent woman, that “the combat” moved at the beginning of this century. One of the great misconceptions of the twentieth century was the false dichotomy between "rationalism and irrationalism", a debate that extended to all fields, including art. First, rationality was confused (the positive side of reason) with rationalism (the pathological feature of reason), and articulated in this lack of discernment was confused irrationalism with freedom. Almost all the art of the twentieth century, with surrealism to the head, worked in this error. The fallacy still exists despite having consolidated the emergence of 'irrationalism' and the consequent relativist currents that followed it. Essentially much of what happened in the twentieth century, it turned around this shock between two paradigms: rationalism versus irrationalism.
Now, I see, the indetermination, chance, the random of the terrible temptation of the causal cage. Holism, in its pathological feature, can be the reductionism that is the way it puts the way as a new 'eschatological narrative'.
Is it "by chance" that holism emerges at the moment when neo-liberalism and its cynical contempt for the human person besides all freedoms, all acquired rights?
Holistic consciousness has brought positively a greater ecological awareness but followed by scholastic rigor drifting reality under the blanket of a determinism that is much more than inconvenience: all great authoritarian ideologies are holistic.
My friend will know how to combine her holistic and transpersonal belief with the freedom and responsibility that every moment asks us - but how many will make the destruction, under a law that explains and encompasses everything?
How many will not be abandoned to what it is?
The awareness of the indeterminate brings tragic conscience, as the Greeks knew, but also brings the will and the courage of the decision. And of this we cannot abdicate.
In addition, as Drummond shows in Carlos Drummond de Andrade's poem “Quadrilha”:
"John loved Teresa who loved Raimundo/ who loved Maria who loved Joaquim who loved Lili/ who did not love anyone./ John went to the United States, Teresa to the convent,/ Raimundo died of disaster, Maria stayed to aunt,/ Joaquim suicide himself and Lili married J. Pinto Fernandes/ who had not entered the story."
Real always runs outside the track, in full exteriority to our concepts. This is what is worth a J. Pinto Fernandes at the exact moment we thought we had everything under control.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Nobel and others</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/10/17/do-nobel-e-outros/</link><description>9/10/22
Reading many people's reactions when the Nobel Prize in this year's literature was announced, I couldn't help but remind me of this repair of Jean-Pierre Siméon, in relation to another Nobel Prize: “An editor of a large national newspaper wrote five lines of indignation because the Nobel Prize for Literature, a complete stranger. But unknown to whom? How did not occur to this patented and paid literary columnist to do his work, that his apparent ignorance was a matter of incorrect professional conduct? Tranströmer was translated into many languages, it was available in French. »
There is always the choir of those waiting for the announcement of the prize to complain about not being invited to the jury of it, there is a subgroup of Irados that professes “I never read and I will not bother to read”; It is an uncommon fauna, which inhabits social networks.
I do not always know all the winners-I was unaware of the existence of Louise Glück, who I find a great poet, or the Olga Tokarczuk, for example-but it only brings me the comfort of knowing that the world is not a soap opera where everyone knows each other and the joy of recognizing that the gauge of the world is not measured with my short measure and that on the contrary it gives me a new opportunity to face the unknown.
And perhaps the most cretin of reactions was the smart one who wrote, but there are still those who read French? Confirming only that today there is a new kind of ignorance that fires with a displeasure: the one who only read English.
I would also prefer that, in French, Pascal Quignard, Linda reads, or even Sollers, or, among the new ones, Mathias is awarded, but that does not take dignity to the work of Annie Ernaux (and it would be enough to have written the “Les Années”). There are books of her that I like less, like the vulgar "a simple passion," but this happens with almost every authors, they have a channel books and others that are like intervals in their itinerary. I advise reading a beautiful book of interviews with her, "L'Ecriture Comme un couteau".

Yesterday came an article in Maputo's morning “News”, realizing that the Pen Club Narrative Prize was assigned to my wife, Teresa Noronha, for her soap opera “Tornado”, which had already had the Maria Velho da Costa award.
The summary they made of the book does not even deserve comments, by pathetic, but what matters to highlight is the note of disqualification about their "Mozambicanity" by calling it Luso-Mozambican. It is not inaccurate, but for those who know the context, it is a dirty touch.
Because finally, following the same logic, Adelino Timóteo should be called Tsonga-Mozambican, to Álvaro Taruma-Mozambican, and Macua-Mozambican to the writers who are from the north, etc., etc. Which is not reported to happen.
At the beyond moment, in the soap opera, she writes:
«Our color has never been dominant. In colonial time we were not white, we were ripped from monories, gone mugs, the pejorative term to speak of a son of Goes and Portuguese. In the postcolonial period, I was not black and if, in Lisbon, they took me by Brazilian or Cape Verdean, already in France were lost in cogitations of where they would be and amazed when they found out it was African. There I had to explain my DNA's wanderings before relying on moorms. It took me a long time to accept that it was so because yes, and that it was no curse that were so; On the contrary, I could even discover intense patterns of fantasy and freedom in this shrewd cloak that is our genealogy… »
In the current Mozambique it is white… and this is overlapping it soon to what it does or what it is.
It is sad, but as Naipaul warned, through these stops the race is everything and is soaked in it as deeply as, elsewhere, in religion.

Bruno Latour, an anthropologist who studied the sciences and their procedures and legitimations, law, technique and religions died and entertained themselves to turn the guts to the dogmas of the “modern”. For him the place, the expert's function, was more defined by the perplexity he embodied than for the supposed truth he would support him.
He proposed, as an alternative to the kinds of multiculturalism and his mistaken password "all different all the same", the return to "diplomacy", given precisely, not from the presupposition that "we are unified because participants of the same nature" but simply reveal that we "do not yet share an ordinary world"; It is necessary to deal frontally with the "abyss of disagreement" that separates us, rather than wanting to delude it.
And about politics said, disassessedly:
«If transparency is required from the politician, we kill him; If one requires fidelity to what the other was or he says, kills him; If a mimetic relationship is required between what the crowd wants and what its representative says, the representation is killed. These must, therefore, by definition, betray, deceive, modify, distort the word. Without this ability to double the word and betray, political language would not exist. I put the perfectly plausible hypothesis that political vocabulary will become as inaccessible as the religious language of the last twenty, three or fifty years. (in “UN Monde Pluriel plus Commun”). I believe it will be missed to decipher this frantically complex world that fit us.</description><pubDate>2022-10-17 02:18:03</pubDate></item><item><title>The yo -yo</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/30/o-fuxi/</link><description>O my friends, companions of these funerals trips to countries as old as the stars and the moon, and as strange as the profound interior of our disgraceful souls, - that startle still awaits us, what secret spells we will have to overcome, what horrors will rise to our dilated pupils of amazement and terror?
Increasingly close to our precarious existences, howling the war monster, which threatens to merge humanity with the earth, incessantly traveled by the squalid spectrum of hunger and the invisible evil of ten thousand pests.
O human human, who cries superior to his own nature, but then reveals to you, once and again, unable to simply order your existence and do not understand that you are possessed by the fickle wrath and are slave to your own ambition! Do not be content with the white jade or the light gold, there is no treasure that gives you your inextinguishable thirst for other men, animals and things; for in you an eternal anguish in you; in you crawl the expelled snakes; For you grows, powerful and impossible, the very fertile ivy of evil!
This is perhaps why on the mound they call the white deer, where one of the eight immortals in sacred mount was evolved through the skies to Penglai, inhabits the fuxa, a bird whose form resembles that of the rooster, although topped by a human head. What strange copulas, what monstrous amplexes, what terrible procedures will have occurred to make the existence of this animal sinister possible? We do not know, but it is enough for our exhausted mind to dare to raise an answer, so we soon feel the skin traveled by horrendous goose bumps and the heart trigger in paraded, which wild horse beaten by the night whip of fear, oblivious to reins and containment.
May men refrain from going through the Mount of the deer, because although there are riches capable of calming the most misunderstanding ambitions, if they have the disgraced fortunate to glimpse a fuxa, it will be immediately triggered the cultivated fields, because it will be beheaded the soft animals, for it will be sacrificed the best young man and destroyed superb from countries.
Fuxi emits a sound that resembles its name. If you hear it, dark night or clear day, goose way, for the path where you find you is the most right of the ways for misfortune!</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Procrastinators Club</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2022/09/29/clube-dos-procrastinadores/</link><description>Walking in rereading of Easter, because of an article I prepare, I give this excerpt, extracted from “the universal man”:
«Every man morally is one and absolute; But you have to live with your personality to mitigate. (…) Coexistence is only possible among people reduced to a negative or hollow presence, which is constantly giving in. Hence, the emptiness of society, a huge ghost composed of numerous deceased. An upper man is antisocial or criminal. Its destination is jail and desert.
He is in thinking about whether she reflects here about the political-social conditioning that gagging, and worse, in a sad country as Portugal was in the middle of the Estado Novo (and the book is from 1931) where any possibilities of spontaneity and frankness in human relations were coarcet, or only lends the behavior of men (oppressed) a metaphysical frame, a “essence”, from a presumption of each one in the presumption of each one be in isolation “one and absolute”. Sometimes, to an excess of spirituality (or longing), it adds to Pascoaes to lack the world. He is a great poet, but he is a poet who takes gray-Jewish ampoules and is therefore written amiiude on a programmatic furor, ceasing to have pores; There is often a glass between him and the real, the same one who made him wring the Ballet, 1921: “Everything is ghost. There are only clouds, clouds of voices, clouds of souls, afflictions and tragedies! Clouds and more clouds, appearances and more appearances! It is a divine lightning that pierces them, the instant appearance that arises and throws us to the ground, dazzled! »
Sometimes I would like to remind him, as António Sérgio did in the article “Regeneration and Tradition, Moral and Economy”, which dedicated to Easter: “Easter, Easter My Dear Friend: You are a pure, excellent, and very noble poet, but also a victim of this social environment, like us all: of this horrible isolation that you praise and I”.
"As a child, he stole two melos," says Jacinto do Prado Coelho, stole him from a nest, and throb his lifetime remorse for it. The person, few more mischief is known to him. Only in Álvaro de Campos sprouts him a twinge of evil and obscenity: “Oh, and ordinary and dirty people, which always seems the same,/ who employs profanity as usual words,/ whose children steal at the grocery door/ and whose daughters at eight years-and I think this is beautiful and I love him! -/ masturbate decent -looking men on the stairs. » (Ode triumphal).
Both poets beaten by a certain idea of ​​holiness, they were identical to the inability of breaking the siege of the skin with the overflow of the dike, the same curse of sublimating Eros's concrete ferocity with the mansuity of the verses.
Of course, they are the two "Bigger Than Life", but sometimes unnerves to watch, from my hostor's post at the Procrastinators Club, to the tantrums between them, just to see who occupies, in the internal organization, the place of president and treasurer.
Although a person has guessed more, for example, this he wrote in the least known martial ode and that is declining in the situation we live today, differently, with the heart in his hands:
«Ode martial

Asked at a press conference about Trump's statements, which accused Zelensky of risking World War II and not ready for peace, the country's Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lin Jian, has just stressed that "China will continue to play a constructive role in the search for a political solution to the Ukraine crisis."
When asked again about the meeting in Washington, the spokesman reiterated the same answer and added that China "is neither the creator of the crisis in Ukraine nor part involved in the conflict."
Beijing supports "all efforts aimed at a peaceful resolution" and hopes that conflict parties will find "a sustainable and lasting solution that responds to their concerns," he said.
Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, China has maintained an ambiguous position on conflict, appealing to respect for the “territorial integrity of all countries,” including Ukraine, and attention for the “legitimate concerns of all countries” in a reference to Russia.
Beijing was opposed to unilateral sanctions against Moscow and appealed to "decancing and a political solution." However, the West accused China of supporting Russia's military campaign, something the Asian country has always denied.
China has sent diplomatic representatives to the region and presented peace initiatives, such as the plan it elaborated with Brazil last year, which did not include the removal of Russian troops and was rejected by Kiev.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 02:11:00</pubDate></item><item><title>USA | Beijing warns that it will retaliate increase in rates</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/eua-pequim-adverte-que-vai-retaliar-aumento-de-taxas/</link><description>China warned yesterday that it will take “all necessary measures” to defend its interests in response to the customs rates that the United States plan to implement today.
"China is firmly opposed to the US decision to impose more rates under the pretext of alleged threats on their security," Lin Jian Ministry spokesman said at a press conference.
"We will take all the necessary measures to protect our legitimate interests," he added. The spokesman accused Washington of "politicizing economic and commercial issues" and said that "in a trade war there are no winners." "US actions undermine normal economic cooperation and impair their own economy and international credibility," Lin said.
Beijing also warned yesterday that "trying to discredit and confront China will not bring any benefit to bilateral relations" and urged the US to return to the "correct path of dialogue and cooperation based on mutual respect."
"A lie, however repeated, will never become true," concluded the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Commercial tensions between the two powers have intensified again in recent days, after US President Donald Trump announced a new 10 percent increase in Chinese products, in addition to the recent 10 percent already applied.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 02:09:03</pubDate></item><item><title>Japan | Greater fire in three decades remains active</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/japao-maior-incendio-em-tres-decadas-continua-activo/</link><description>The largest forest fire in Japan in three decades has consumed 2,100 hectares and remains active in Office, province of Iwate, extending to a forest and surrounding neighborhoods near the city of Sanriku.
Faced with the spread of the fire, the city issued new evacuation orders at 7:00 am yesterday, affecting 1,197 people, which were transferred to 12 centers. "We are working to extinguish [the fire] as soon as possible, looking at the safety of residents at the same time," Yoshimasa Hayashi, said yesterday, said at a press conference.
The Japanese National Agency for Fire and Catastrophs Managed this Sunday has appealed to firefighters from all over the country to the union of efforts to combat fire and especially in the impediment of “propagation of fire in the resident area,” added Hayashi.
About 1,700 firefighters from 453 archipelago departments participate in the operation, supporting local force on the ground and air, with helicopters of self-defense forces.
Since the beginning of the fire last Wednesday, at least one death has been confirmed and the number of destroyed houses ascends to 84, but the authorities predict that the numbers increase when it is possible to evaluate the true dimension of the catastrophe, since the efforts to combat fire are currently prioritized.
Bad memories
The southern coast of the province of Iwate, where the city of Sanriku is located, has been on a dry weather alert since February 18, a phenomenon that favored the spread of the flames.
The local meteorological observatory provided for the maintenance of dry weather this Monday, although temperatures have passed hot and spring over the weekend to a sharp descent.
Forest Fire, the largest in the country for over three decades, has been raising, among residents, memories of the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, which devastated the coast of offunate, making more than 500 dead and missing, and destroying a large number of houses and buildings.

The Annual Meeting of the National Popular Assembly (APN), which starts on Wednesday, (see pages 2-3), should constitute "an opportunity" for Chinese leaders to communicate to local authorities "clear expectations in the form of guidelines and execution deadlines" from their latest policies to attract foreign investment and capital, they say.
"The House expects it to continue to be emphasized to stabilize foreign investment, in line with the plans announced to date," he said.
At the end of February, the government officialized a plan to “stabilize” foreign investment in sectors such as telecommunications, health care and education, having updated its list of areas where foreign investment is not allowed, reducing the number from 31 to 29, and eliminating all restrictions on the transforming industry.
China has also promised to authorize the creation of entirely foreign property hospitals in certain cities and regions of the country.
According to Bloomberg news agency, China registered a negative foreign investment balance last year: in November alone, investment in China was $ 188.9 billion, while China's exits to other countries were $ 234.6 billion, which makes it the largest monthly deficit of the historical series.
The European business group considered that the “full implementation” of measures to optimize the business environment remains “the best way to restore trust in the Chinese market”.
The body said the meeting is expected to focus on measures that could “stimulate domestic consumption” and that, like 2024, a goal of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of about 5 percent for this year is fixed.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 01:57:59</pubDate></item><item><title>China | Industrial activity increased to a maximum of three months in February</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/china-actividade-industrial-aumentou-para-um-maximo-de-tres-meses-em-fevereiro/</link><description>China's transforming industry activity has grown in February to the strongest pace of the last three months, according to a private analysis based on sector data released yesterday.
The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), compiled by the British Economic Information Company IHS Markit and published by Chinese CAIXIN magazine, rose 0.7 points to 50.8 points in February.
When it is over 50 points, PMI suggests an expansion of the sector, while below this barrier presupposes a contraction of the activity. The value also exceeded the expectations of analysts, who expected a more modest recovery for about 50.3 points.
This weekend, the National Statistics Office (GNE) released its official PMI for February, which has also hit its best reading since November. In this case, it has passed negative in January (49.1) to the expansion level (50.2) last month.
Balances to enjoy
According to Wang Zhe, CAIXI economist, the “powerful recovery” of consumption during the New Year's holidays lunar has boosted confidence in the sector, although the economy still faces problems, such as uncertainty in the labor market or family income, which make efforts to boost internal demand.
Prior to the opening this week of the annual session of China's highest legislative agency, the National Popular Assembly, Wang appealed to support measures to focus on market expectations and society's concerns, giving priority to demand side initiatives.
Zichun Huang, analyst at British Capital Economics consultant, highlighted the improvement of both production and new orders in February, also referring to greater demand from abroad.
In the latter case, the analyst stated that the external demand for Chinese products is probably driven by US importers, who are accelerating their purchases before the additional fees announced by US President Donald Trump, and expecting new rates to be applied later.</description><pubDate>2025-03-04 01:54:38</pubDate></item><item><title>HK / Bag | Mixue actions debut with 40% appreciation</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/04/hk-bolsa-accoes-da-mixue-estreiam-se-com-valorizacao-de-40/</link><description>The largest chain of food products and drinks in the world, Chinese Mixue, debuted yesterday on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with gains of up to 40 percent after an almost record offer. The actions opened with an increase of 29.4 percent, compared to the pre-abortion price of 202.5 dollars from Hong Kong and, in the middle of the session, were rising 40.05 percent.
This situation contrasts with the tendency of other local rival companies that also opened capital last year and, after the initial enthusiasm, registered strong falls, given the intense competition in the sector.
Mixue said last Friday that the search for its actions was 5.258 times higher than the number of actions offered, which makes it one of the most successful initial public offering operations (OPI) in the history of the former British colony scholarship. The company based in Zhengzhou, downtown China, raised $ 3.455 billion from Hong Kong with Opi.
Mixue, which focuses especially on the popular bubble teas (tea with milk and tapioca balls), ice cream cones or soda, had over 46,000 stores worldwide in late 2024, more than double the number at the end of 2021, which attests to its rapid expansion thanks to the cheap product model.
These numbers exceed better global names, such as McDonald's and Starbucks, which are the only ones to overcome the mark of the 40,000 stores worldwide.
Hard competition
The fourth to first place jump from the table took place at the end of the third quarter of 2024, according to Singapore's Momentum Works consultant, who recalls that the vast majority of points of sale is in China, with only about 4,800 spread through Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand.

"China regrets and opposes this decision and will do everything it deems necessary to defend its legitimate interests," the Ministry of Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a press conference.
Lin said unilateral rates impair both the World Trade Organization and international trade relations and insisted that "there are no winners in commercial wars."
Considering the fentanil “an internal problem of the United States,” Chinese diplomacy spokesman said Washington is using his opioid crisis to “press and coerce” China, although the Asian country is “one of the hardest” in the fight against the drug. The diplomat also stressed that Beijing has supported the US in his response to the Fentanil problem, transnational cooperation with results he described as "very remarkable."
The diplomat urged Washington to address the problems "through dialogue and on an equality" and reiterated that China is willing to continue to cooperate with the US to achieve a "solid, stable and healthy" relationship.
The conviction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs follows to that of the Ministry of Commerce, which stated hours before China will take "all necessary countermeasures" to "defend its rights and legitimate interests."
United States President Donald Trump promised on Thursday that his country would impose an additional 10 percent rate on China to join the other rate at the same value previously announced, with the argument that the Asian country made enough efforts to combat Fentanil entry in the US.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:05:55</pubDate></item><item><title>AVIC | Largest amphibian plane in the world concludes flight certification tests</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/03/03/avic-maior-aviao-anfibio-do-mundo-conclui-testes-de-certificacao-de-voo/</link><description>The world's largest amphibious aircraft, the Ag600, completed all the flight tests needed to obtain aircraft certification, aviation industry corporation of China (AVIC).
The Ag600, also the first large amphibian plane built in China, measures 39.6 meters long and 38.8 meters of wingspan, a size similar to that of a Boeing 737, and has a maximum weight of 53.5 tons. An amphibious plane is a model capable of peeling and landing on land and water.
The plane, which was designed mainly for maritime rescue and fire -fighting missions, completed the latest flight tests in Shaanxi province in northwest China, Avic said, one of the country's state aircraft manufacturers in a statement.
Over the past two years, the AG600 has completed 3,560 hours of flight in preparation for aircraft certification, the Chinese state consortium added. Flight tests were performed in a wide range of scenarios, including extreme cold, high temperatures and moisture and strong winds to verify the operational capabilities of the aircraft.
The Ag600 is the largest amphibian aircraft currently in operation, comparable to scale to narrow fuselage aircraft such as Boeing 737 or Airbus A320. The first takeover of the aircraft took place on December 24, 2017, followed by another successful flight in 2018.

The government led by Donald Trump confirmed this week that it will eliminate more than 90 percent of US Agency for International Development Agency (USAID) and $ 60 billion in general assistance around the world.
In Africa, cuts should have a particularly severe impact on health, which occupies the largest share of US support to the continent. Similar to what happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts expect China to fill the void left by Washington again.
“Among African leaders, China has already built significant influence. Now it has the opportunity to seduce public opinion, ”explained Paul Natulya, a researcher at the African Center for Strategic Studies, a US Department of Defense Institute and funded by the US Congress.
The US provides more than a quarter of all development aid on the African continent. An analysis performed by Denver's International Futures concluded that cuts can shoot another 5.7 million Africans below the $ 2.15 extreme poverty per day next year.
During Trump's first term, which coincided with the Covid-19 pandemic, Africa became the region that most benefited from Chinese vaccine donations, testing, masks or fans, while Washington diminished his contributions and withdrew from the World Health Organization.
"When the West retained donations of vaccines and medical equipment, China quickly filled the void," Natulya recalled. "In return, they received a lot of publicity and prestige, for a relatively small investment," he noted.
Ranking in the ranking
Different surveys now show that China has surpassed the United States in the popularity rate among African public opinion.
According to an international poll from the Gallup Association, Beijing's approval among Africans went from 52 percent in 2022 to 58 percent in 2023, while Washington's popularity fell from 59 percent to 56 percent in the same period. Inquiries conducted by other institutes, such as Afrobarometer and Ichikowitz Family Foundation, demonstrate the same trend.
"China is using all the tools at its disposal to gain this competitive advantage in the face of the United States," the researcher described. "At this time, I bet that, in Beijing, employees are studying the next step and when and how to increase China's contribution," he said.</description><pubDate>2025-03-03 00:01:26</pubDate></item><item><title>Jimson Kun Wa Koi, President of the Macau Young Symphony Orchestra: “Macau is a culture space”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/jimson-kin-wa-hoi-presidente-da-orquestra-sinfonica-jovem-de-macau-macau-e-um-espaco-de-cultura/</link><description>The President of the Macao Youth Symphonic Orchestra, Jimson Kin Wa Hoi, defends support for classical music and young people. At the head of the orchestra two decades ago, the official reveals to HM details about the next concerts, including a passage in Portugal and the “24th Concert of the New Generation of Musicians 2025”, scheduled for this Sunday at the Cultural Center of Macau
 
Image: António Sanmfaurn_MacauNews
Let's start talking about the show at the Great Auditorium of the Macao Cultural Center (CCM) this Sunday. It is a great opportunity to reveal your project to the public.
Yes. In fact, the orchestra has existed since 1997, almost 28 years ago. Throughout this time we held about 100 concerts, in what we call Macao signature shows. The new generation of local musicians is indeed quite enthusiastic about the show we will have next Sunday.
Conducting concerts and participation in festivals is the most visible part of your project. But how many musicians are they currently on the orchestra? To what extent is the orchestra important for young people who want to be musicians?
We are indeed the only youth orchestra in Macao that provides specific training in this musical genre. At this stage, young musicians may have the opportunity to show their talent. We really try to build a new generation of musicians. This type of show encourages them to learn and go out more, studying music over the years, so it's really very important to them. In Sunday's show, musicians will have the opportunity to play in orchestra, and this year we organized two auditions to choose the soloists. I am happy to have a total of 33 groups of young people who participated in these auditions this year, where nine soloists were chosen.
He is the director of the only youth orchestra in Macau. How do you describe the panorama of musical formation of younger people? Where do you need to improve?
Yes of course. I started playing from the Macao orchestra from an early age, I'm a violinist. I can tell you that, at the level of training, most teachers are from Hong Kong or Guangzhou, that every week moving to Macau to train our young people. Macau is well known as the city of the game, but it is also a cultural space. You can feel the heritage that exists in Macau, thanks in part to the previous Portuguese administration, and we have to thank the maintenance of this Portuguese culture and a whole western culture mixed with the eastern. Macau is special for that. I think we have to promote this culture and know how to develop it. In the case of classical music, we started to have an orchestra in 1983, still during the government of the Portuguese administration, and there we also organized a series of competitions for the younger ones. The Macao International Music Festival also began to be organized several decades ago, as well as the Macao Arts Festival. Today, Macau has more initiatives of this genre and this is good for enriching our culture, especially the classical music that is made in the territory.
In addition to the Sunday show, what is on the Macao Youth Orchestra Agenda for this year?
I can tell you that we will participate in this year's edition of the Mafra Music Festival “Filipe de Sousa”, scheduled for July. I will visit Mafra and all the places where we will act, have meetings and organize myself with production. It will not be the first time we are, as a group, in Portugal, but I think that for most young musicians will be the first time. Our orchestra has played twice in Portugal, the first time was in 2010.
Do you understand that the Macao government should give more support for classical music training?
I always think that the government should give more support to classical music studies. For this it is not enough to spend money on the organization of festivals, it takes a greater focus on music education. We also have to teach the population how to appreciate classical music, listening to it and consuming it so that they can know what they hear and go to concerts. Macao is a small territory with about 600,000 inhabitants, and has a lot of money because of the game. We have to use this money to build a Macao culture, which includes classical music. We must create a city that shows its culture, so I always encourage the government to support musical formation. Not just for professional orchestras, but for youth orchestras and music associations.
Macao also lacks higher education courses in the music area, having only the Conservatory. Is this also a gap?
It's right. There are several universities in Macao, but there is, in fact, a lack of formative offer in the area of ​​music. The conservatory does not offer this formation at higher level. At this time, students who want to study music professionally have to leave Macau and go to Europe, the United States of America, Hong Kong or even China. But, on the other hand, the population of Macau is very small and maintaining a conservatory with another type of formative offer would cost a lot of money. I think the best you can do is the government financially supporting these excellent students to be accepted in courses outside Macao.
The young stars that will take the stage of the Cultural Center of Macau
Organized by the Macao Youth Symphonic Orchestra Association, Sunday's show starts at 7:45 pm and has as its motto “Progressing Towards The Future” [progressing towards the future]. The show will be directed by Italian conductor Lorenzo Antonio Iosco, who is also clarinetist and has been working with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra. Before moving to Asia in 2015, he studied clarinet at the Luigi Cherubini Conservatory in Florence and played in Spain and London.
With regard to the young Macao musicians who take the stage on Sunday, highlighting Zita Ho Nok Chon, born in the territory in 2009, and member of the orchestra since 2021. The young woman attend Pui Ching high school, studies violin and has participated in several contests with distinction. It has played in the orchestra as the first and second violinist.
In the harp stands out Eugenia Wong Hei U, born in 2011 and a student at the Anglican College of Macao. He began playing this instrument with only four years, starting his training at the Conservatory School of Music, which earned his first award when he was only five years old. It currently has classes with Ann Huang, the main harpist at Sinfonietta from Hong Kong.
To HM Eugenia Wong hei u confessed that he feels very pleased by the opportunity provided by the CCM concert. “It has been a great honor to be part of this orchestra, where I met many talented partners and earn a great musical knowledge.”
Another name of Macao on the young orchestra is Brian Mui On Ian, violinist, who also attends Pui Ching Secondary School. In addition to the violin, he began studying piano in 2018. The young man was one of the soloists of last year's edition of the Macao Youth Symphonic Orchestra, the “23rd Macau Music New Generation Musicians Concert 2024”, where he played the composition “Bruch Double Concerto In and Minor”.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Cristina Ferreira, jurist and professor at the University of Macau: “The Fatf was in the right place and moment”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/27/cristina-ferreira-jurista-e-docente-da-universidade-de-macau-o-faft-estava-no-lugar-e-momento-certos/</link><description>Cristina Ferreira, an expert in international law, investigated the legal status of the “International Financial Action Group”, which fights money laundering and terrorism financing. In the book “The Legal Status of the Financial Action Task Force in the International Legal System”, the jurist discusses the undefined legal status of the body that got great power worldwide
 
What are the main reasons for the creation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)?
The FATF emerges within the scope of the G7 in July 1989, largely at the United States of America (US), to respond to the crime of laundering of capital trafficking and the United Nations Convention against illicit trafficking and psychotropic substances of 1988. Common guidelines and the coordination of preventive measures, especially in the financial level and international cooperation. 40 international recommendations were elaborated against the laundering of capital ”. Today the FATF has 40 members, 38 jurisdictions, the European Commission and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The last member, Indonesia, entered 2023. These members represent industrialized countries, large financial squares and emerging economies.
How do you evaluate the performance of the FATF over the years?
He played a very important role of leadership after September 11, 2001. Suddenly, the fight against terrorism (FT) became an international obligation and priority on the agenda of all countries. In the international level, the states were urged to be part of the International Convention to suppress terrorism financing, as well as regional or international agreements and actions to combat terrorism and their financing. Internally, countries have been instituted to criminalize the FT, to adopt FLS, prevention and detection measures of the FT in financial entities, such as banks and insurers, and non-finances, such as casinos, real estate agencies or pledge stores. To adopt new international instruments that harmonize or even standardize the practices of various states, and agree on their content, it may take years. But the fatf was in the right place and moment. Given its informal nature and flexibility to adjust your mandate due to the threats that could exist in the financial system and its technical know-how, the FATF incorporated in its mandate the fight against FT and produced recommendations, at a time when this matter was new to most jurisdictions. The FATF acted quickly, useful and efficiently to the international community. It had experienced experts in the financial area and the ability to assist in the application [of the recommendations] and supervise its execution. The same happened in 2009, following the 2008 financial crisis and the G20 request to reinforce measures intended for transparency and combat corruption. Therefore, it has been a positive way.
It argues that the FATF has occurred in a “institutional metamorphosis” in this body. As?
The FATF was created as an informal, technical and temporary group, renewable every eight years, but over 30 years has become an increasingly complex organization, governing 206 jurisdictions today. The extension of the mandate also implied the evolution of its powers and responsibilities, and today the FATF is worldwide recognized as the international authority on this matter. It is endowed with a public power of world governance whose recognition is translated into several resolutions of the UN Security Council.
The study comes to clarify the legal status of FATF. What status is this and what is the connection with other entities also linked to the fight against FT and money laundering?
The FATF is the world authority responsible for setting international standards, rules and policies on these subjects and there is no duplication of functions with other international organizations and entities, including International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the European Union. This study argues that the gradual evolution of the mandate, the FATF's institutional structure and 'modus operandi' has changed its 'modus constiti'. That is, an organization can evolve into an international organization of full right, regardless of the initial intention of the members and not being created by a treaty.
How do you explain that, to date, the FATF Legal Statute is lacking clarification?
I think there was never a real interest in analyzing this issue in depth. This theme was addressed between 2016 and 2018, during the Spanish and Argentine FATF Presidencies, but was “Marinar”, with the argument that there would be a advantage of maintaining a flexible entity to more easily be able to respond to emerging challenges and risks against safety, transparency and integrity of the international financial system. But the fact is that the FATF began to stop and exercise enormous power, as it evaluates and identifies non-compliant jurisdictions, naming them in lists ('Blacklisting'). It may also install measures to members and non -members, a power detained by very few international organizations.
To what extent does your recommendations impact and put into practice?
FATF recommendations have impact because countries are regularly evaluated on their application, called the “Technical Compliance”, and the effectiveness of their practical application, with the designation of “immediate outcomes”. This assessment is made according to strict criteria, being given a classification. If the result is disabled, the jurisdiction has to make a high level of resolution political commitment to these deficiencies, becoming part of the 'gray list', subject to an action plan and a term [compliance]. In the absence of political commitment or lack of sufficient progress in the execution of the plan, jurisdiction can be appointed to the 'blacklist', and the FATF may appeal to all FATF network jurisdictions to advise their financial institutions to reinforce diligence measures regarding the risks associated with such a jurisdiction. This is what has been happening to Myanmar since October 2022. If jurisdiction has serious deficiencies or does not comply with the action plan or is not a member of a regional group, it can be appointed to the 'blacklist'. In this case, the FATF may appeal to apply the 'Recommendation 19' measures, ranging from reinforcing the diligence and systematic communication of transactions and operations involving jurisdiction to the limitation or prohibition of financial transactions with jurisdiction.

Are there some concrete examples?
This happens with Iran and North Korea two decades ago. The international reputation [from this measure to a country] is real, has a political and economic cost. A study of the 2021 International Monetary Fund (IMF) reveals that the estimated negative effects of 7.6 percent of gross domestic product on capital flows and a significant reduction in foreign direct investment in the jurisdictions in the 'gray list' and may even have consequences under IMF.
It raises, in the book, the question of the importance of FATF in the global institutional landscape. What importance is this?
FATF serves as an institutional, operational and regime model for other international organizations. This study develops a theoretical model that can be used in any organization that acts on the international scene, gathers the same objective elements and whose legal status is uncommon. In the background, the FATF is a practical case. International law is not static and one has to analyze reality and adjust the models, and they must reflect the objective reality of the international legal order.
China and Hong Kong are members of the FATF. What is the relationship of MSAR and local policies to combat FT and money laundering with this entity?
MSAR is a member of one of the FATF regional groups-the Asia-Pacific group to combat capital bleaching (APG), and obeys the recommendations and mechanisms of FATF supervision, exercised by APG. Macau has had a good performance, obviously fulfilling his recommendations. This happened, for example, with the adoption of the property freezing regime and the law of transmitting control control of cash and negotiable instruments to the bearer. Incidentally, the MSAR was the world's first jurisdiction to obtain the best technical compliance note compared to the 40 FATF recommendations when it was evaluated in 2017.
What are the main challenges that FATF currently faces in combating this type of crimes?
The use of new technologies, virtual currency and limited access to formal financial services leading to the use of unregulated channels, increasing the risks of capital bleaching and FT. In the book also speak of the economic pit and response or action capacity between FATF's member jurisdictions regarding the member jurisdictions of regional groups. Many of them are fragile or low -income economies, so it is not surprising that they have more disabilities or difficulties in complying with FATF international standards. In APG, by way of example, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Timor-Leste and Tuvalu are on the World Bank list of 2023 of the least developed countries, which makes the uniform and global application of FATF standards and policies difficult. In addition, the standards, policies, evaluation procedures and recommendations or FATF action plans are poorly flexible or adjustable to the local reality and internal and regional conditionalisms of non -FATF member jurisdictions. A more equitable participation or representation of these jurisdictions in the final decision -making process of the FATF should also be ensured in order to increase its legitimacy and transparency.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>Interview | Shan Hai Jing, a museum and the appetite of the old</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/entrevista-escrever-uma-nova-versao-da-historia-mundial-parte-ii/</link><description>An interview with the duo of authors of the next English language publication Shan Hai Jing Code 《上古文明密码》, which today Macau has already presented, but now becomes a museum. Michael Du &amp; Julie Oyang, the authors are currently organizing a breathless textual race through the most important piece of Chinese literature and the heaviest treasure of Chinese culture and… beyond. Julie Oyang is an art and culture critique based on Europe, commentator of Chinese culture and visual philosopher. He is a guest professor at the University of São José in Macau, China. Michael Du is a knowledgeable of the Ancient Chinese Canadian culture, holding the largest collection of Hongshan civilization in the world. He is the founder of Haikou Kiwen International Art &amp; Culture Co. Ltd. (海口啓運國際文化藝術品有限公司) and Kiwen International Cultural Exchange (Yantai) Co.ltd (国际文化交流（烟台）有限公司). Both authors are closely involved in the operation of the China Museum of Art for Pre-Dinastic Civilizations (华夏上古文明艺术馆), which will soon open in Yantai, China.
Q: In part I of the interview, we talked about the historical meaning of the former Chinese manuscript Shan Hai Jing 《山海经》, also known as the Book of Mountains and Seas, especially its universality. What follows?
Michael: We have talked about how a deeper study of Shan Hai Jing can help us understand the origin of the first human civilizations on Earth. But we are makers. We are not for the written pages: we want to ensure that Shan Hai Jing is relevant and alive and making it part of the current culture. With this objective, I found a new company. Kiwen International Cultural Exchange (Yantai) Co.ltd (启运国际文化交流（烟台）有限公司) was created after Haikou Kiwen International Art &amp; Culture Co. Ltd. (海口啓運國際文化藝術品有限公司) is the place where global investigation will take place and the global exchange of knowledge will be encouraged and stimulated in the form of international delegations and high level visitors. We know so little about the old ones, there are so many questions to ask…
Julie: In fact, there is so much to do. There is so much we can do. In collaboration with the Chinese government, we are both involved in the operation of the China Museum of Art for Pre-Dinastic Civilizations (华夏上古文明艺术馆), where Michael cures his own collection of artifacts, as well as privately renowned private collections, including all pre-doinestic civilizations such as Hongshan, Liangzhu, Shanxingui, HongShuihe, Shijiahe, etc. These art objects have never been exposed and were never explained by traditional historians. We understand that it is extremely important for us to provide private collectors a place where they can show their journey dedicated to seeking answers to questions about humanity. In this sense, the China Museum of Art for Pre-Dinastic Civilizations (华夏上古文明艺术馆), which should open in Yantai in April, is a unique and brilliant view. We even have the architecture to correspond to this vision. Our goal is to educate the global public in general, as well as establish a connection with the young audience in a fun way and with high quality standards.
Beyond the exhibition, which will do more to make the mysterious old “alive and active” to the global audience?
Julie: At this time, Michael and I are planning a parallel exhibition and a workshop in collaboration with French artist chef Gil Gonzalez-Foerster (Chinese name: 晓松). In a way, the Yantai museum is a time capsule where an old and faded memory is stored. And Gil's kitchen deals with memory, this time from these pre-Dinastic civilizations, starting from Shan Hai Jing. Being the imaginative guardian of memory, the Chinese classic contains the oldest memory in China, or even in the world. Shan Hai Jing records ancient memories in the form of mythology meditations and the most interesting facts about flora and fauna known for their magical power and powerful force that live from one extreme to the other. This seems to be the reputation of this ancient and inexhaustible text. But Shan Hai Jing is also an extraordinary recipe book!
But why food?
Michael: You are what you eat. Food is an essential part of everyday human life that can tell us more about the past. When a dish is no longer remembered, part of us cease to exist. Food is perhaps the most intimate and sensual memory. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why Shan Hai Jing was written: remember through food? Our curated exhibition will become more complete, more 3D, more realistic, exploring the taste of the ancients!
Julie: Shan Hai Jing documents diverse gastronomic experiences, mixing natural history and food knowledge. His humanist approach makes Shan Hai Jing unique in his genre. The word Shi (食), “eat”, appears more than 160 times in the book, of the ancients. There are, however, many cases about exotic food that heals medical conditions quite familiar to modern men, but Shan Hai Jing also offers cure for conditions such as arrogance, confusion/lack of wisdom, ward off physical dangers. This is a unique culinary philosophy! Food involves the mind, not just the taste. To provoke the intellect. This deep idea is still deeply rooted in modern Chinese food. Through our exhibition, we also understand why Confucius taught his disciples that food is a virtuous gift and why the great Chinese scholarly poets were famous food lovers.
We currently do not know who was the author of the mysterious Chinese classic whose imagination exceeds a thousand and one nights…
Michael: The ancients were "men of appetite." Appetite can explain humanity's historical and economic landscapes more clearly than academic jargon.
Speaking of economics, how is the museum economy managed?
Michael: The museum is an educational organism. It is also a business. We focused on five volumes of business. The investigation mainly involves cooperation with various institutions and training programs in China. We organize courses, events and publications. This part will generate 7.6 million RMB/year. Ticket sales will generate 7.2 million RMB/year. Authenticity certification will generate 3.5 million RMB/year. We will also form art and antique auctions agents, whose program will generate 4.9 million RMB/year. In spring and fall, a large scale auction will be held, with a conservative estimate of 50 million RMB of auction volume. This amount does not include revenues from the commission of 15% of sellers and buyers. In addition, four more themed auction games will be held annually, with a conservative estimate of 5 million RMB of business volume and 6 million RMB of auctioning commission.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>António Queirós, philosopher and academic: “the West there is great ignorance” about China</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/21/antonio-queiros-filosofo-e-academico-a-ocidente-ha-uma-grande-ignorancia-sobre-a-china/</link><description>Doctorate in Philosophy of Sciences, Environmental and Environmental Ethics, António Queirós, linked to the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon, regrets that the West continues to face China in the wrong way, especially in environmental issues.

Will talk about the theme “The Environmental Crisis and the China Eco-Civilization Project”. What project is this?
This is China's great project for the New Age. It is a concept that began to be elaborated from 2013. This idea began to be realized with different projects. Since the “New Democracy” regime, which resulted from the Chinese resistance to the occupation of Japan and the geopolitical confrontation of the countries of the axis of different democracies. This is when the Popular Republic of China is proclaimed, such as the proclamation of the “new democracy” and comes the awareness of the world's environmental crisis by China, with the regime to evolve into the so-called “ecological socialism” from 2003. It was necessary for the country to experience a model of industrialization common to the early experiences of socialism, and above all capitalist countries. China's fundamental thesis is that all regimes can collaborate in building a new civilization, but this implies outdoor democratic reforms that are consigned in global civilization proposals, guaranteeing peace according to the principle of indivisibility of security. But I would like to point out the moment when the United Nations (UN), representing the whole world, became aware of the existence of an environmental crisis, from the Stockholm Conference, which took place in 1972. In China this process of awareness of the socialist state organs, citizens and parties, began in 2003. It is strange that issues like this will never be debated. The ideological confrontation that comes from the Cold War did not cease with Helsinquia's agreements, and therefore there are themes that are unknown to the West because of this harmful tradition of the Cold War, which has extended, and because the media have no openness to discuss and present the proposals that China makes.
China is present and is an important actor in world meetings on environment and climate. Why do you understand that there is no discussion the West about the concept of eco-civilization?
It is not discussed why the West there is great ignorance about China and the reality of the country. The only advantage I have about most people who write and talk about China is that my relationship with the country is over 50 years old. I know how China was presented to the West 50 years ago. We lived [in Portugal], a fascist regime where information came to people with great difficulty. I have seen these years to all kinds of visions about China that lacked concrete information, because the country, until reform and openness, was a closed society. But this lack of information was general in the West. I also had visions that were not reality and I began to question whether China's historical experience is unique, without parallel in the history of society, democracy and socialism, for its historical characteristics, hermeneutics, in the sense of method, the analysis of concepts and starting points, which predominates the West, does not serve. But then let's go to the concrete issue, which is the responsibilities that China has in environmental matters.
Which, specifically, are…
One thing is the contribution that give China, India and other countries to global warming, because they are populations that represent most of humanity. There are technologies that are themselves polluting. But if we look at this angle we ended up falsifying reality, because greenhouse gases that exist in the atmosphere have been at least 150 years ago due to European and American industrialization. In terms of historical responsibility, the US is largely responsible [for global warming], and I cite official European Union data, for example. I speak of tons of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere in all these years.
Because they industrialized much earlier than China.
Yes, and presented an industry without this kind of environmental concerns. Therefore, this reality is hidden, which greenhouse gases have begun to pollute for 150 years and which is not only today's contributions [which are the major causes of global warming].
Therefore, the idea that China is the main polluting country finds it wrong.
In current terms China and India can be the most polluting. But they are neither in “per capita” nor historically. What is really [in the Western discourse] is that they currently contribute [to global warming]. But then we have to see the trends where we are going to walk. But if we deepen this topic we have come to even less favorable conclusions to Western policies. China's environmental history can be summed up at four periods. The first period is in the years of reform and openness, from 1978, and the fourth period is when China launches the pilot projects of ecological civilization. The process is global. Still in relation to China's responsibilities, in the first phase the West and the industrialized east carried to China the most polluting industries, because China's appeal was to industrialize and create more employment. The UN resolution that adds an article beyond the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, finally recognizes as an inalienable right of the human being to a healthy environment. This statement, the West, completely truncated, reduced to no thing, has a preamble with 30 articles in which the environmental issue is not posed. Since this statement is no longer in line with the current political and social reality, it has been concealed, mutilated and reduced to formal freedoms. Also ignored by the set of citizens who do not know their origin either. China is co-founder of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a fact that is also concealed. But I also wanted to talk about the largest fallacy of the Western environmental policy.
What is it?
The idea that, from now on, one will protect nature. So what is done to what was destroyed? Especially in developing countries, because it was there that we sent these residues from the polluting industries and exploited all resources. No one wanted to know that, and what did China did? He assumed the leadership of the process and through his diplomacy to "act without acting," Tao's way, without violating nature, respecting the laws and dignity of things, approving the Kunming-Montreal agreement [on biodiversity]. We then have a commitment that the US probably will lie down to the rubbish crate to recover the biotypes that are destroyed, because much of the world is in environmental crisis and has so far been whistling to the side. China has a gradual view that risk factors in the environmental crisis tend to decrease with China's effort, both nationally and international. But the most remarkable issue in the idea of ​​building an ecological state in the country was the fact that, at the initiative of President XI Jinping, principles of environmental philosophy were included in the Statutes of the Chinese Communist Party, an unprecedented fact in another Communist Party and even some ecologists.
Global reformulation
According to the study “Ecological Civilization in the People’s Republic of China: VALUES, Action, and Future Needs”, by Arthur Hanson, published in 2019 by Asian Development Bank, the concept of ecological civilization “is being used by the Popular Republic of China (RPC) to provide a coherent conceptual framework for adjustments to development that responds to the century. XXI.
It differs from sustainable development in the emphasis placed in political and cultural factors, as well as in the definition of new relationships between people and nature that allow you to live well and within the eco-environmental boundaries of planet Earth. ”
In addition to reducing pollution and promoting circular economy, for example, they are also considered “domain of finance, law, institutional reinforcement and technological innovation”, having already been defined some ideas in five-year five-term agents, especially until 2035, when it is expected that ecological civilization, in its basic form, is fully implemented for the modernization of the RPC ”.</description><pubDate>2025-02-21 00:36:40</pubDate></item><item><title>Piménio Ferreira: “Anti-igan rhetoric has always worked in Portugal”</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2021/04/26/pimenio-ferreira-a-retorica-anti-cigana-sempre-funcionou-em-portugal/</link><description>Piménio Ferreira, better known as Gitelles Ferreira, anti-racist militant, 34, physical engineer, national Romani. He is a man with a provocative speech, a corrosive mood, kind and a smile that leaves no one indifferent
Gitelles, we live in an intercultural land and the Gypsies - in particular - have lived about five centuries in Portugal. What is going on for Gypsy communities to remain “on the fringes” of the so -called society? 
The model of society remains to be changed. This is extremely stratified by placing people in subordinate places to privilege a violent minority. The white social structure is patriarchal and racist. What is called the "margin" of society is actually an intrinsic place to it, which belongs to it. In other words, Gypsy people have been included in this model of society since they discovered Europe and its kingdoms. The problem is the model of society that is maintained and the place to which they were relegated and how they were relegated: with violence, in inferior status against whites, without the right to human dignity, to constitute a family, to choose one's own language and religion, expropriated from any and all cultural and material law. A place built and maintained to this day by violence and genocidal and ethnicidal persecution. In 1463, a Gitano Vasco was drowned to an estate. In 1521, Gitans, or Gypsies, were already used as a reference for all that is considered bad in the model of society. The "counter-exemple" in the face of the white that would stand out for the positive. The 'angel' and the 'devil'; the 'other', the enemy; That against whom any attack and persecution is legitimate. Including the prohibition of defending, having weapons, any kind of goods, and the right of permanence.
And is this right to permanence that we still have nomadic gypsy communities within the country is denied?
Yes, no doubt. There are many ways to force nomadism: directly, prohibiting permanence and expelling with police or military force; indirectly, refusing public or private housing to Gypsy people, as they are Gypsy; and even through the gentrification process.
I read the result of an inquiry from the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, which is said to be approximately 80% of the Gypsies responded to the risk threshold of poverty in their country; One in three Gypsies lives in a housing without channeled water; One in three Gypsies belongs to a family where someone hungry at least once the previous month; and 50% of Gypsies aged 6 to 24 do not attend school. Why does this happen like this? 
It is the historical persecution, which continues. There is no impoverishment that has no external cause. In this case, a political system of total expropriation and imposed on the basis of violence. Already in 1648, D John IV, the restorer, prohibited ‘Giving or Rent houses to Gypsies’. The same D John IV who got the kingdom of Portugal thanks to D. Jerónimo da Costa and his 250 knights. The same D. Jerónimo da Costa who had died to defend Portugal's independence from Castile. Gypsy, like his wife and children. Between prohibitions of permanence, “that do not enter Gypsies in the Kingdom and leave those who are” (D John III, 1526), ​​with expulsions, degred to the galleys, expropriation of goods and properties, imposed with stripping, mutilation and death, systematically performed to this day (still in 2011 Faro City Council wanted to ban Gypsies in the municipality).
The prohibition of working on others (no one employs Gypsy workers, and those who accept they do it in total precariousness, for poorly paid positions and without decent rights and conditions). They cannot be dependent on their own work, they cannot get investment means due to extreme expropriation. Are dependent on precariousness. If you want to know what it is like to live in pure neoliberalism, know the lives of Gypsies. Their reality is paradigmatic of the aggression and depletion to which the "gentlemen" are willing to go to their benefit.
Are you talking about economic and political power?
The group of political, social, cultural and economic power. The owner, the colonizer. This group that has been in power since it established the system of current domination. And that only makes sense within the hierarchically stratified sociopolitical model in which we live. Hence the need to end 'gentlemen' and institute a new model of society, healthy, free, without hierarchies or strata, whether of race, class or gender.
The model we live in leads to the Gypsy (and not only) community to economic exclusion, removing it from access to product consumption or excluding them from its production process; political exclusion associated with lack of access to information; To education and consequently the social exclusion that is seen in inequality of access to quality community areas such as restaurants, libraries, theater, cinema, concerts, health care, etc. How do you feel a gypsy child when you realize that it is not part of a whole? Children who are never represented, neither in movies, nor in books, nor in cartoons, not even in an announcement to eat cereals, for example? Is this a disaster for self-esteem, is a priori condemnation?
The question is that. Gypsy people are not “excluded from society”, by contrast, they are included in it. The problem is the existence of what is cynically called 'social exclusion', which term Orwellian, and there be under coercion, people. Which field of concentration and extermination. Incidentally, Nazi concentration camps are a more visual realization than called 'social exclusion' and, as here, were not a 'excluded' part of Nazi society, but rather its fundamental and characterizing structure. It is a place of violence, where people are maintained by violence, dedicated to their extermination, and designed so that few people can leave. And yet they resist. As in Nazi concentration camps.
And what you have listed as an example of 'consequence' of this 'exclusion', is actually the means by which this exclusion also happens and remains. Gypsy people are out of theaters, both as consumers and producers (but go to the cinema). They are out of school, education and the gym. Either as 'users' or as producers (but go to school and are on the basis of knowledge construction and academic and scientific debates).
Even in attacking Gypsy children's self -confidence, we talk about a maintenance mechanism of this situation. But Gypsy people respond very well: with Gypsy pride. Another resistance, another aggression. Gypsy people are thus included in society. In a place that belongs to this model of modern society. And they resist and contradict the power of domination and make a point of being in the city, in the cinema, in the theater, in the gym, in all spaces. With a lot of struggle and always resisting, but they are there. Social exclusion, more than a “place outside of society”, is part of its social structure.
Do you want to say that there is a collective resistance?
At work, already in a context of absolute precariousness, during the pandemic, Gypsy people rolled up sleeves and showed once again proactivity and creativity in adversity. They learned seeing and doing. And here, it is again the women who jump to the front line, face, learn to use digital tools with their daughters or children, and throw themselves into the network. And so they explore online sales as well as application by application (transportation or rehabs). In housing, in a context of pandemic in which the evictions were not locked - as they owed and dictated the law itself - residents did not fail to organize and fight unjust evictions and claim dignity in housing; associations of allied residents in their action with other housing and anti-racist struggle organizations.
It should also be noted how they reinvented and intensified to raise and distribute dietary goods and kits of masks/alcohol gel to the most expropriated people. Gypsies and non -Gypsies. In the anti-racist struggle, new movements emerged and their actions intensified by social networks. People who had never been organized or militated before began their first steps in activism, thickening this way of the organization and popular gypsy and anti-racist action. People forget, or do not want to value, but Gypsy action has helped determine results in the political dispute. Gypsy citizens mobilized in large and determined electoral results in the municipalities of 2017, both in Alentejo and in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, even causing electoral earthquakes.
And even in the presidential, second place was resolved by a value equivalent to the estimated number of Gypsy voters. Apart from the non -Gypsy votes that were mobilized by the action of Gypsy voters. Gypsy people are even co-considering power in the spaces of opinion, local media, social networks and party and institutional political dispute. And most importantly, in the popular Ação and alliances with other social movements. We have never stopped fighting for all means and continuing to resist.
In contrast there are more and more hate speeches, from the far right in particular. What do you have to say about it?
To start these speeches are historical and European. Not even current and even less “of the far right”. These speeches have been adopted and rendered for a long time, even in 'democracy and freedom', by several representatives of the center right, conservatives, left center, liberal, liberal left, even representatives of the PCP. Anti-egana rhetoric has always worked in Portugal as it is the whiter rhetoric [white genesis]. That is, it allows you to create and give the "white" as the superior of all. And so please the white electorate who, when feeling well, pays off with his vote. Even if the policies implemented by their elected harm him even more.
Finally, did you like them to talk a little about your personal experience and how did you get to the activist?
I studied, fought for studies, made alliances, graduated, went in the labor market of the “formal precariousness”. I started my militant action and here I am today. We can transform this society a better. This certainty combined with the fact that the current one has so much suffering makes anyone want to have a transformist attitude. I wanted to be 'inventor' (physical engineer) and anti -racist militant. And through study (not necessarily schooling) and organization with others, in turn, with other studies, formations and visions, I learned how the world works and how it can be changed. But before transforming, we need to survive.
Hence two types of actions arise: transformative and survival. The struggle against hate discourse arises as survival, but his defeat will be a transformative victory. There is a lot that - like people who want a better world - we have to do, namely working to criminalize hatred speech; condemn and prohibit organizations with racist discourses and practices; denounce the racist institutional structure and logics that organize power and generate community resources. And in this sense, there have been various types of actions, of petitions, to manifestations. And we need more.
I, besides being a military man in the SOS Racism movement, participate in the “We came to stay” podcast, with Mamadou BA and Joseph da Silva. And if all goes well, we will soon start a new project. With friendly people, we also have the project “Gypsy Initiative”, dedicated to reflecting and promoting transformative movements. Essentially focused on educating against anti-agigarism, denouncing historical and continued genocide and working for a new society project. Also with new projects on the gutter. And finally, there are always voluntary actions without an organization, where I try to share what I found out about anti-egism and Roman history in schools and with interested people. In addition, there is still the struggle for housing, because the evictions did not stop during the pandemic. Due to housing and work precariousness, the subjects racialized especially the Roma nationals are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. There is essential to have actions in this area; Of all the struggles, this is the most structural, as it goes against one of the main enemies of a healthy society: the real estate speculation of this capitalist system, which places profit and goods above people and their humanization.</description><pubDate /></item><item><title>GP TCR | Australia confirms presence in Macau</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/19/gp-tcr-australia-confirma-presenca-em-macau/</link><description>The 2025 season of TCR Australia will end largely when joining the TCR World Tour in the race of the 72nd Macao Grand Prix, which will take place from 13 to 16 November
 
After welcoming TCR China by 2024, the FIA ​​TCR World Tour “worldwide” will have the company of the Australian competitors in the most demanding race of the season, as HM had already foreseen at the end of last year.
This announcement is the second news in the calendar of one of the largest national TCR competitions in the world, after the announcement of a new promoter for the championship.
One pilot who was certainly pleased with the news was Australian Ben Bargwanna, who ran on the streets of Macao in 2023. TCR Australia's first international participation was made possible by the global rights holder, the WSC Group, which will ensure full transportation costs for Australian teams traveling to Macau.
"TCR Australia has always been one of TCR's most important and exciting competitions, rooted in the long tradition of tourism motorsport in the country," said WSC Group president Marcello Lotti. The Italian businessman made it clear that “when logistical issues forced us to cancel the Australian rounds of Kumho Fia TCR World Tour last year, we immediately started working to return in 2025. It is fantastic to extend cooperation for a second event and offer Australian competitors the unique opportunity to finish the season in Macau.”
Other applause
TCR Australia Prosecutor David Sonenscher, an old acquaintance of Macao, highlighted the importance of the moment for the category.
"I am very happy to bring TCR Australia to one of the most iconic circuits in the world and certainly one of the biggest challenges for a pilot," said former Malaysian-based English driver and entrepreneur and co-founder of TCR Asia. “The opportunity to expand our cooperation with the TCR World Tour FIA and to show the talented Australian riders on the highest international stage in Macau demonstrates the unique opportunity that TCR Australia and the TCR Global Platform provide all participants.”
Confirmation of the presence of TCR Australia in the Guide Race should not be impeded to the participation of local pilots and the interior of China in the most celebrated tourist car race on the Asian continent.</description><pubDate>2025-02-19 01:54:58</pubDate></item><item><title>Motorcycling | FHO RACING WITH NEW FOCUS IN 2025</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/13/motociclismo-fho-racing-com-novo-foco-em-2025/</link><description>Doubts dissipated this week. Macau's businesswoman Foye Ho's FHO Racing will continue to active in the 2025 season, but without the initially announced riders. Peter Hickman and Davey Todd are leaving and goes to a new team called 8ten Racing
 
According to a statement sent by FHO Racing, BMW Motorrad UK has restructured its training for the 2025 British Superbike Championship, and FHO Racing BMW will compete with a single pilot aboard a BMW M 1000 RR. German 2024 Superbike Champion and Resistance World Cup driver, Ilya Mikhalchik, will make his debut in the British competition, at a time when team owner Faye Ho, realinhas the objectives of his team “to explore new activities in motorized new markets, with the support of BMW Motorrad Motorsport”.
Currently in his fifth year at the British Superbike Championship Paddock, Faye Ho has been a strong presence in the British competition, as well as in the popular road races, such as the Macao Grand Prix, as well as supporting several young female riders, helping them progress in their careers since the lower classes. Faye Ho, Stanley Ho's granddaughter and Clementina Leitão, has supported Kate Walker and Jamie Hanks-Bliott on BMW F 900 R Cup and, it seems, which will continue to support.
To be
Contrary to the rumors that put her from Paddock's departure, Faye Ho made it clear that she is a “great advocate of the British Superbike Championship, one of the world's most exciting and competitive competitions” and will keep her commitment to discipline. However, the territory entrepreneur now has new objectives for herself and its structure. The future will be in Asia and support for young female talents.
"Given my long -term objectives, which include expanding motor sport activities in Asia and continuing to support young women in motorcycling, I realized that I cannot dedicate the same time, to the British Superbike Championship and the road races, which I gave them since I became the owner of the team in 2021, due to additional commitments I have in Macao," Faye Ho said.
Another chapter
This announcement has put an end to a successful partnership, particularly on the island of Man TT, between Peter Hickman, four times winner of the Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, and Fho Racing. Hickman left some words of thanks to his now former boss.
“I want to leave a huge thanks to Faye [Ho] and Fho Racing for all they have done for me over the past four years,” Hickman wrote in a Facebook social network post. “As it is normal in motorized sport, we had amazing moments and others more difficult, but Fho has always been and always will be a fundamental part of my career. I will be eternally grateful for this opportunity. ”
The new 8ten Racing team, which will be officially presented on February 26, will be mostly composed of former FHO Racing elements. Hickman and Todd will maintain the important support of BMW Motorrad UK and are expected on the big prize starting grid in November.</description><pubDate>2025-02-13 01:30:05</pubDate></item><item><title>GP Macau | FIA confirms GT World Cup</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/28/gp-macau-fia-confirma-taca-do-mundo-de-gt/</link><description>The World Council of the FIA ​​last Wednesday confirmed the expected, that the eighth edition of the FIA ​​GT World Cup will be held as part of the Macao's 72nd Grand Program, from November 13 to 16. However, there is a big news for this year's edition
 
The International Federation, which co-organizes this race in partnership with Sro Motorsports Group and the Macau-China General Automotive Association (AAMC), took the opportunity to announce a new qualification model for the race. In addition to the 30 -minute qualification session equal to the previous editions (Q1), a second qualification segment (Q2) was added, reserved for the top ten pilots of the first session.
The Q2 session will be held in Super Pole format, with each pilot to go to the track individually for a total of two qualification turns, and each pilot is also allowed to use a new tire set at this session. This novelty will allow qualification to be decided without interference from third parties.
The remaining program of the Queen of GT will remain the same as the previous editions, with the free training session, the traditional 12-lap classification race on Saturday afternoon, followed by the 16-lap main race that will decide the world's Cup winner on Sunday.
Veterans compliments
These measures introduced by the FIA ​​were very well received by the most experienced GT riders. This is because traffic has always been a huge obstacle in obtaining a good qualification return on the guide circuit, something essential for those who aim to win this title.
"It's an excellent idea to introduce the Super Pole session in Macao," said German Maro Engel, the winner of the World Cup last edition by Mercedes-AMG. This will be one of the most spectacular and exciting sessions of the season and should also secure sports justice. Fans have a lot to yearn. ”
Raffaele Marciello, for two winning occasions of this trophy, and one of BMW's factory riders, also reacted positively, adding: “In Macao, it was always complicated to make a clean turn. With this new format, you will not hear the excuse of traffic or a red flag. Having only two laps will be very challenging, but now the fastest pilot will probably be in pole. ”
This is an opinion shared by Laurens Vanthoor, the World Cup winner in 2016, who said there will no longer be “apologies” in the qualification. Porsche's experienced Belgian pilot believes that “there will be an added pressure because you only have these two turns”, because in a difficult circuit like this, “if you make an error, there is nothing else to follow. In a normal qualification, you have more opportunities. Personally, a shootout is always something I appreciate a lot. For pilots, on a track like this, it will be almost the highlight of the weekend. ”
And the younger ones too
Chinese pilot Yifei Ye premiered at the Grand Prix last November at the World Cup. Ferrari's official pilot, which competes in the Endurance Fia World Championship (WEC), has left a good impression on the guide circuit, and he also welcomes the now introduced measurements.
“It's good to eliminate these red flag interventions and yellow flags, so that in the end, the one that really is the fastest to get pole position,” said Yifei Ye that she could return to the race this year. “In Macau, everyone is very close in terms of times, so it will be extremely difficult for pilots to try to reach Super Pole. I think it will also be great for viewers. ”</description><pubDate>2025-02-28 01:03:51</pubDate></item><item><title>GP | Célio Alves Dias will continue to run this season</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/24/gp-celio-alves-dias-vai-continuar-a-correr-esta-temporada/</link><description>Macaense pilot Célio Alves Dias was one of the long -term returns of the 2024 car.
 
The Macao Cup winner of Macau in 2021 was removed from motorsport at the time of 2023 for personal reasons, but last year made his debut in the competition that joins the Toyota Gr86 (ZN8) and the Subaru BRZ (ZD8). Despite the vast experience in tests of the specialty, having conducted several generations of tourism cars, Célio Alves Dias had never managed the new bobbinns that the Macao-China General Association (AAMC) introduced in its competition in 2023. Last time turned out to be of learning, with some difficulties in the tuning and behavior of the Japanese car.
Participation in races at the Zhuzhou International Circuit and the Macau Grand Prix made Célio Alves Dias realize that his Toyota GR86 was not at the strongest competition level. Based on the conclusions drawn from these experiences, he decided to start preparing for the new season.
“The car had to be all dismantled. My car was bought on Monday, and the chassis and the security arc, for me, were not well done, ”explained Fu Lei Racing Team pilot to HM. “This, made the car too hard and very difficult to bow. I tried a car from China, which was well assembled, and there is a difference. I had a long time in January, in China, with this car. Our cars, made in the same workshop, were very hard, which made it difficult to make turns fast. ”
If in the Macao Grand Prix, the house riders, excellent guide circuit, managed to equate the progress to their hong Kong opponents and the interior of China, in the initial races on the Zhuzhou track in Hunan province, it wasn't quite like that. “There are many differences between cars, but especially in chassis, because engines, in terms of power and horses, are almost all at the same level. Our opponents also experienced many pieces, many engines, even gearboxes, and chassis. Competition cars are always the same. You have to have engine power, but also chassis. Having only power is not enough. Having better a good chassis is the most important. ”
Silver Jubilee in November
Being a usual Portuguese name in the Macao Grand Prix in recent decades, Célio Alves Dias debuted at the Guide Circuit in 2000 and from then was a frequent presence and no fouls in the race until 2023. This year, its objective is to account for its twenty-fifth participation in the largest sports event of RAEM, but will have to align in the findings.
While awaiting the announcement of the 2025 calendar by AAMC, Célio Alves Dias details details to start his test program, because his Toyota, after being reviewed, "is ready to test" in the interior of China, something that will happen "very soon," says the pilot.
In the last edition of the Grand Prix, Célio Alves Dias qualified in 12th place for the Macau Roadsport Challenge race. However, his participation was short and unhappy: at the wheel of Toyota with dorsal No. 11, was forced to give up after being immobilized on the climb of San Francisco. The Macanese pilot was out of the race on the first lap, in an incident that caused the Safety Car.</description><pubDate>2025-02-24 02:50:53</pubDate></item><item><title>FHO RACING | Peter Hickman denies closing</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/02/07/fho-racing-peter-hickman-nega-encerramento/</link><description>Peter Hickman, four times winner of the Macao Motorcycle Grand Prix, denied the rumors that claimed that the team Racing, from Macau Faye Ho businesswoman, would have closed the doors and would be absent on the British Superbike Championship (BSB) and the Macao Grand Prix in 2025
 
Peter Hickman goes to the fifth season in the British Championship with Fho Racing, however, before the season's start, some rumors came to circulate in Paddock about the team's future. In recent years, FHO Racing has become one of the top teams in the British Superbike Championship and road events, such as the MAN's island TT or the Macao Grand Prix.
Last November, the team announced that they featured Peter Hickman and Davey Todd, winner of the troubled last edition of the Macao Grand Motor Prize in the British Superbike Championship. Faye Ho said at the time that “for 2025 and also for this year's Macao Grand Prix, we have a very strong team, with Davey joining Pete and Michael aboard the BMW. We have two super talented riders on the roads for next season, and with Davey jumping to the Superbike class, after winning the Superstock Championship for the second time, I think we'll have a strong season. I can't expect my team to return to Macau, I love to share my hometown with the team and show all points of interest, it's such a special place for me. ”
Although Hickman and Todd have been present at the BMW Motorrad Motorsport season in Berlin in mid -January, since November that Fho Racing has no news, which has generated some discomfort and doubts among fans. Hickman was testing his BMW M1000RR from his Phr Performance in Spain, when he responded with a striking "no" to a fan of a fan on Instagram social network about the rumor of FHO Racing activity ceasing, a "no" that had wide repercussion in the specialized British press.
It's not the first time
After a difficult season of his team in 2024 in the British Superbike Championship, Faye Ho, Stanley Ho's granddaughter, had to face similar rumors last September. In Oulton Park, before the opening race of the 2024 showdown, Faye Ho confirmed to journalists that FHO Racing would continue to participate in the 2025 British Superbike Championship, “which is good news, but anything will be announced in time. But I'm happy to be back here and to stay here, it's a big championship and I love to be in this racing environment. ”
To increase speculation between fans, Hickman suggested on social networks a change of direction this year, leaving an announcement about his plans for the North West 200 and TT of the island of Man. In Spain, the British will have tested with his motorcycle without any reference and FHO Racing spectals, while Todd changed his profile photo on social networks, for a photo with a motorcycle from Milwaukee BMW by Tas Racing.
Sources of the world of motorcycling tell us that the future of FHO Racing is expected to be known in the coming days, but one thing is that Hickman, regardless of the team, has in his sports program to the trip to masters in November, to try to win the fifth victory in the guide circuit.</description><pubDate>2025-02-07 02:20:15</pubDate></item><item><title>GT Cup | Great Bay Race gains impulse from the interior</title><link>https://hojemacau.com.mo/2025/01/27/taca-gt-corrida-da-grande-baia-ganha-impulso-do-interior/</link><description>The GT Cup-Great Bay Race will join this year, the newly created Sro GT Cup, the latest GT competition launched in the interior of China, inspired by the GT4 class vehicles of the Macau Grand Prix
 
On the eve of last Christmas, Sro Motorsport Group, the entity responsible for organizing numerous races and championships, including the GT World Challenge Asia and, as the official partner of the FIA, the coordination of the FIA ​​GT World Cup in Macau, announced the creation of a competition for GT4 vehicles, made up of four events in China. At the time of the announcement, only the inaugural event in Shanghai and the end in Beijing had been confirmed as part of the calendar.
Almost 30 cars, representing an impressive total of ten car builders, participated in the GT Cup - Great Bay Race of 2024, a race that has become an important milestone over the weekend of the Macao Grand Prix in recent years. Indeed, no other GT4 event in Asia brings together such quantity and diversity of cars. The Balance of Performance (BOP), responsible for balancing the performance of the various participating cars, was, at the time, managed by SRO.
In a statement, Benjamin Franassovici, managing director of Sro Motorsports Asia, said:
“We are enchanted, proud and privileged for adding the GT Cup - Great Bay Race to the inaugural calendar of Sro GT Cup, which begins and ends with the two largest motorized sports events in China. We already have a strong working relationship with the GT Cup - Great Bay Race, which has become the most significant race for GT4 cars in Asia. Its inclusion in the 2025 calendar of the SRO underlines the size of our ambition for this new national series. ”
High interest
The SRO GT Cup debut season begins in March at China's Formula 1 Grand Prix in Shanghai, before moving to the Zhuhai International Circuit - a place previously visited by SRO in BPR times and the FIA ​​GT Championship - where two 30 -minute races are planned. This is followed by Beijing's new city circuit, which will host the GT World Challenge Asia on the same weekend, before the big end of the Sro GT Cup season, scheduled for a month later at the Guide Circuit in Macao.
The enthusiasm surrounding this competition is evident. As Benjamin Franassovici said, “This is reflected in the number of consultations and registration for the full season we have received since the release of the championship, just before Christmas. The demand has exceeded our expectations. ”
Up to 28 cars will be able to compete in the season end event on the streets of Macau, with places to be assigned based on the classification after the second round of the championship, which is scheduled for the Zhuhai Permanent Circuit. All pilots with “bronze” or “silver” classifications attributed by the FIA ​​are eligible to compete in this competition, as long as they use approved cars from the GT4 class.
To attract brands, the results of SRO GT Cup races will tell the SRO GT4 builders ranking, a title attributed to the brand with better performance in the GT4 category at the end of each season. SRO GT CUP joins its Asian equivalent, Japan Cup, in a list that also includes continental and national competitions in Europe, America and Australia.</description><pubDate>2025-01-27 11:13:41</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
